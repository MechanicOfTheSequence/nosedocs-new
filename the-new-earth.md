# the new earth

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oyZGW99os)

as randall is talking about the symbolism, I'm getting these pictures in my mind of the new earth. the earth has a cube inside of it and this is the "core" of the new earth and has higer consciousness beings living inside of it. I don't really know what I was seeing there because there were times when he was talking and I was pereiving this same jerusalem core as a moon. he specifically mentions that there is an object out there with a 1500 mile diameter, which is, to the best of my knowledge, pluto. I don't know how all of that fits in. I'd love to talk with him, I suppose, but for now I'm just going to speculate wildly and then correct myself later (my usual process, hehehe)

the picture that I was seeing was the usual one, where you have these "enlightened beings" that are in the centre of the new earth and they are like the "models" for the next wave of humans. humans are created in the image of the gods (or angels, depending how you see it), and the gods have the "ideal" proportions resonating in harmony with the proportions of the planet.

sligahtly unrelated, but maybe not too much, there was this other thing, that whenever randall said the word "builders", I would flash back to this one time when I compared the builders to the creators (don't remember the context now) -- and the thing is that the builders take pride in their construction technique and their craftsmanship, leaving the design aspect to someone else. that someone else is the "architect" or the "father" (I suppose). on this philosophical level, I don't really know who the architect is. is it just the next rank up on the power structures, or what. I don't really fit that box, as I wouldn't consider myself either an architect or a builder either. I just desire and then watch it happen like magic. I can accomplish anything I want, so long as I don't reqire that the design is my own. so, there's this funny thing because I just put things that I want out there (soft desires) and then they just start happening without any direction of my own effort. they just appear and they turn out way better than I could have ever dreamed them to be. in that sense, I've always seen myself a lot in a person like steve jobs. I know more than enough to know what I'm talking about, but I'd rather other people do the designing. my job is to come up with the next innovation (desire) or next improvement that I want to see.

so, in that sense, I'm neither a builder or an architect. I let source work out all of the details for me. some people really want to be involved in the details of stuff, but I can care less about that. for me, the details only describe the abstract function behind it. I think purely in function and in interaction, not as much in the form of asthetics or presentation. I leave all of that for others. I guess in that way, I"m sort of like an higher-level builder in the sense that I don't determine the asthetics or the form. it's just different.

one of the things that has long fascinated me was tesla's capability of visualising things in his imagination. I always thought that would be such a great thing to do. however, my own experience is that when I spend a lot of time contemplating something in my imagination, I fall in love with the image more than the feeling. this includes my own image. when I was younger, I used to think I was very beautiful and I would enjoy seeing myself in the mirror. I don't really do that so much anymore, as the last thing I want to do is to fall in love with an image of myself. reason is, I have to maintain the image that I or others are so enfatuated with. inshead, now I focus only how things feel to me in a purely functional manner, allowing the function/interaction to determine the feel which can then take on many desirable physical forms... which, for most people, the desirable physical form is what most people would would say is what transmits the feeling.

### the new jerusalem

the reedemed (agora) ones living in the new jerusalem. he describes them as coming from the market square (new jerusalem is a square/cube), and it has to do with puchasing their way (paying the price / earning it) to be saved in the new jerusalem. these are the "awakened ones". the ones that gods name (TTT/YHVH) written in their foreheads (geometriticians, builders).

clearly these are the privileged elite.

further along, it gives a description of the new jerusalem, and it does not have access to see the sun or moon, but is radiant and filled with the light of the lamb (aryans). therefore, I can only imagine what would be described as the new "tartarus" or centre of the earth dwelling. I don't really know how the dimensions would be exactly, but I assume it would be cubical, and have a centre sun. the whole place would be filled with radiant light, so I don't really know why I want to have a radient sun in the middle. I think the central "sun" would be a crystaline (probably cube) structure with a vertical (iron?) rod that emaniates at various frequencies. this is like the spinal cord of the planet, and would be the resonating antenna which would produce the different shells arund the new earth.

### the walls of the new jerusalem which are the (measure of man)

clearly, walls are not to the city. the reason is becsause the city is 12000 furlongs (1500 miles) wide, and the wall is only 144 cubits which is ~248 feet with the ERC or 216 imperial cubit.  therefore, there's no way this is a wall around the city. the clue that is given is that the 144 cubits given are to the measure of a man or an angel.

the wall has 12 foundations with the names of apostles of the lamb, and had 12 gates, three on each side.

therefore, this must be meaning that it is a harmonic of the exterior structure -- the 1500 mile cube.

interestingly enough, this is reminding me a lot of the chestaheron, which has a cube in it. assuming the chestahedron surrounding the cube is the size of the earth, the diagonal of the cube will be rounghly the size of the moon. so, if you measure the diameter of the sphere which surrounds a cube of 1500 miles, you gut a sphere with diameter of 2121 miles (roughly the size of the moon).

---

therefore the picture that ish emerging for me is a cube (1500 miles wide), then 13 harmonic structures inside of the cube resulting in a final cube which is 144 cubits wide (which is the harmonic of man).

so, if you imagine the new earth (sphere around chestaheron) surrounding this cubical core (new jerusalem), inside of the cube there are 4 root3 diagonals of 2598 miles. I imagine one of the diagonals being the north pole, the south, and then a plane cutting the cube along the equator, where the "wall" will be aligned to the root3 diagonals in the cube, in line with the equator (axis of rotation)[^1]. this cube is found in the chestahedron when the tetrahedral angles open to where they are equidistant from each other, making a hexagon. this happens at precisely the equator.

I would assume that the first (and last) "foundation" is a cube, meaning that 12 more concentric harmonic "foundations" are found within it, arriving finally to the "wall" of 144 cubits. I believe this will be centred around the "ideal" (angelic) man, having 6.8714 feet in height[^2]. I'll have a closer look into robert edward grant's work for other measurements that place the "chakras" up to the positions they would be with the centre of the circle centred around the naval.

it then lists the "foundations" as being rays of precious stones.

- jasper
- sapphire
- chalcedony
- emerald
- sardonyx
- carnelian
- chrysolite
- beryl
- topaz
- chrysoprase
- jacinth
- amethyst

I suppose a study may need to go into the colour and/or the shape of their crystaline structure. I just don't know or care anything about this[^3]. however, what I do perceive is concentric geometric shapes (probably energetic structures) coming together to form these shapes, likely similar to a 3d version of "metatron's cube". it should either create an energetic or physical structure which resonates with the central "spinal column" (antenna).

also worth mentioning because then the whole thing makes sense is that it is described as having 12 gates (chakras), one for each of the tribes of israel. however, as doug points out, there were 11, not 12, one of them gotting two portions while the others only 1. this makes perfect sense because the outer cube (1500 miles) and the inner cube (the one containing the "12 gates" are both cubes/squares), so you can imagine that whhat you have is precisely what I want to create. I want to move from a 7-ray system to a 9-ray system, then to an 11-ray system, so it's essentially a transformer taking 11-rays of energy and condensing them into 7-rays which is what the humans will experience.

this makes perfect sense because I envision these 4 new rays as having the ability to essentially condense 6 rays into 2 (3:1) affecting the emotional (5) and the structure (3) rays.

- desire
- relational
- structure
- (new) thrust
- (new) YHVH
- source
- (new) identity
- (new) temporal
- emotional
- imagination
- physical

those names are temporary :)

### reasoning

I figure that this is going to be a pretty difficult thing for you guys to keep humans humans and not gods. in order to do so, the humans will have to be at a severe disadvantage and will have to really be able to easily be spread thin and mixed easily. I'm pretty certain that the attempt to try and hold the humans away from becoming gods is certainly a futile one, but if you were able to begin to be able to stay head, this could eventually begin to have the capability of becoming a self-replicating expanding structure which can grow liearly or log(n) with growth, which could eventually enable my super-far-in-the-future goal of finding a way to "go infinite".

though this structure seems cool to me, the thing that really interests me is the automaton of contrast idea where they are have their desire programmed. I think this is the most essential aspect to any reasonable success at preventing humans from becoming gods for at least the next thousand years or so. I simply cannot imagine being successful without this.

[3]: to me, this sounds like a mind-blowing effort to create superior physical conditions -- and I just don't want anything of that. I don't care that others are concerned with physical harmonies and stuff, and do what you want, right -- but, for me, I'm more concerned with stuff like identities, timelines, conceptual programs, and symbols. those are the important stuff to get right, as those are the key components to make all of this efficient to split, divide, mix and create geometric personality duels -- bleh, like something the cancels out or balances out the other.
