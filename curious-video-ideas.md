# curious video ideas

occasionally when I'm watching videos they bring me to another question that could be explained. or, perhaps I'm just thinking and there's something I don't understand, which I (personally) would find an explanatory video on the subject very satisfying. there is a lot that a video can do to obfuscate an idea because it disallows so much in-the-moment thinking (long pauses in a video are bad), and not everyone pauses to think about things so the cadance of the video forces my brain to think in an irregular pattern. therefore, often times later on I will be reminded of a video (mental hooks are key for this) and it sparks so further thought on the subject.

however, the tremendous advantage to a video is that although I have a concept in my mind on the subject, that concept never takes a visual format for me so when I finally "see" the concept in an illustration (or whatever visual mechanism is used to explain the idea), I notice things I hadn't ever previously considered before.

### why do air conditioners use copper tubing?

I live next to an air conditioner unit so I know exactly what he's talking about, but I then wondered, "why do air conditioners run copper refrigerant lines from the compressor/condensor to the evaporator". later on in the video (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/_-mBeYC2KGc?t=714)) he mentiones that the hose gets hot and some of that heat is transferred back into the room that is being cooled.

ok, so then if you want to isolate the big thermal differences to reduce losses, why is the refrigerant passed between units in a copper pipes? copper is a great thermal conductor so some portion of that of that cold just accomplished in the compressor/condensor will be absorbed by the copper on its way back to the evaporator. why not transfer the refrigerant in an insulator?

hypothesis: using a non-insulator must be important, because I noticed that there are copper pipes with insulators around them so some effort is made to use a conductor and then insulate it (cause I think copper is more expensive than PVC). my guess is that I think a lot of insulators are also hydrophillic. therefore when running water is passed over them, my brain says that this may be a good way to produce massive static electric discharges.

so that's true, then I want to know more about the surfaces that generate static electritcity, can running water be used to separate charges just as easily as a brush does?


### how does the cirulatory system work?

we know that if you're pumping water into a pipe that splits, the water will take the path of least resistance, so therefore for our entire body to receive bloodflow, all veins must have equal or very similar amounts of resistance. looking at the size variation, we know this isn't true. there are all sorts of sizes (and so therefore resistances) to the fluid flow in the circulatory system. therefore it must work based on suction. the cells must be "sucking" or attracting blood somehow.

hypothesis: I suspect that this has to do with O2 and CO2 charge difference. basically the cells are attracting O2, then attach some thing to it (carbon or whatever), this changes the overall polarity of the attraction and so then is attracted back to the heart/lungs.

I don't think there are any clear interfaces between the cell and the vein, so instead I imatgine it as a sort of highway of available nutrients flowing around, and the cells that are needing things are attracting the things they need right out of the veins. the wall of the veins must able to allow various size moleculs pass through it at will (like in the blood brain barrier). so then we can even think of neurotransmitters in the brain as attractors of a certain "type" of molecule. different receptors and the various molecules that "fit" inside of them must resonate similarly.
