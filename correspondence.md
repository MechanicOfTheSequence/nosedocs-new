hey man, I found my way here from goldjacketluke's video. I found your perspective on addiction as identity particularly enlighetening. I hadn't ever really thought about it like that ubt it's really true.

I've had a number of different addictions: alcohol, weed, cigs, MDMA, cocaine, which I started and stopped a number of times each. I started and stopped them so frequently, I got used to going a few days without smoking cigarettes or drinking before going back to it. it was kind of like fasting the addiction like I fasted food from time to time. I think fasting is a very good way to strengthen one's own resolve toward knowing what they want to do.

like you mentioned in the first part, it was an important thing for me to find out that desire is all to feel a certain way. even with that knowledge I got better at quitting addictive behaviour. I knew that I would desire to feel good and the drug was my fastest way to get there. I simply don't have enough willpower (you call it order) to be able to control myself in any meaningful way. I have *never* successfully stayed on a 1 whatever a timeperiod schedule, ever. it just doesn't work for me.

what did work for me though was when I was finally began to figure out how to feel the way I wanted to feel, dispite the circumstances. so imagine I'm going into a bar and I see a bunch of people hanging out. I want to drink a little bit to loosen up and make me a little more social. well, because I've drank so much in the past I know what that feels like. I used to get really freaked out by crowded spaces (like in a disco or a crowded bar) and felt I *needed* to drink to feel drown out the chotic feelings.

you probably figured out that I'm hyper sensitive by now (you are too, hehe). this appears like a defect at first, but like stuart's law: a powerful absorber is also a powerful emitter. my capacity to absorb (sensitivity) to my environment, also means that I have the same capacity to create my own environment -- meaning I can feel the way I want to feel. I don't need to drink to numb the chaotic feelings. instead, I can just feel the way I want to feel. I remember how I felt when I was on MDMA (or having a good time drinking) and I just let that feeling begin to rise. it rises slowly at first, but with practise, you can learn to do this more and more rapidly. when a thought comes up like, "I don't feel like this. or I don't feel that exhileration" comes up, don't mind it too much. you can play a mental game and trick yourself to notice yourself becoming more and more euphoric as you *allow* it to happen. I say allow, because making it happen won't work. this capacity is a receptive capacity. you just tune into what you want to feel like (be remembering it), and then allow yourself to receive it, without contradicting it. it's possible to get really good at this. I'll let you experiment with it :)

---

so, how does that relate to addiction? like I said, I had no willpower, so I couldn't control my chaos. because of present circumstances I have less and less willpower all the time. it's no problem though because I found that I don't need it. if I can feel the way I want to feel, I no longer addicted to anything. any time I feel the desire rise to feel a certain way, I can find a way to feel that way (emotionally).

I'm just now starting to get really good at this, but I'm definitely solid enough now to claim that I'm very capable to expert now in this capacity. I believe that this can extend into the physical. if I'm so good at it, I *should* be able to begin to feel anyway I want. I'll probably do a few more intermittant fastings to practise this, but I believe that before *anything* is made physical, first it is felt. this has been true for me all of my life and, it's only when I was oblivious to the feeling did I walk into certain disaster... lol

so, I think this capacity can modify everything from your appearance to your DNA, to sleeping, eating, sex, or really anything physical. if I can find a way to feel the way I want to feel, the physical, I believe must conform to how I feel. I'm just beginning this now (cause I feel stable in my capacity enough), I'll let you know how it goes :)

cheers man!

replies:

Wow thanks man for the awesome comment!  I love what you are saying about creating your environment by allowing a feeling to be created!!!  Really cool!   I'm definitely going to try what you are saying and see if it works.  

From my experience, feeling is indeed the predecessor to the physical... yet from my studies and experiences I have found that the mind works in this way:
First there is an impulse, the impulse then creates desire or a feeling, the desire or the feeling then produces a call to action or rather a thought, then finally the person uses rightness and reason to either grant the thought birth into the physical realm or the thought is denied.  In relation to addiction what usually has occurred is the "rightness and reason" faculty has been hijacked and overruled by a very powerful desire and/or feeling.  Addiction forms by a continued feeding of the desire and feeling part of the brain and by continually ignoring the rightness and reason faculty.  If done enough, eventually someone who is addicted can't tell the difference between their desire/feeling component and the rightness/reason component.  

With all this being said I think what you are saying could definitely work!  If you are able to feed the feeling part of the process with a memory of the feeling you got from doing something you were addicted to, I think that you could trick your brain like your saying... very interesting!  Thanks again for such a great comment!

hey man! I was struggling to figure out what I wanted to tell you about identity because it got me thinking a lot. identity is involved in a lot of everyday activities. just think about how if you're a patriots fan (or whatever), then you get your fix by consuming content that makes you feel good in association with that identity. so, it's kind of all wrapped up into everything. your video came at a time when I was really considering all of these things (it's almost as if LOA is a real thing, lol)

anyway, so going back to common addiction: what happens is I would identify myself as something, like a reggae pothead or whatever and so I feel obligated (internal expectaion) to maintain that identity. because the addiction is intertwined with that, then the addiction maintains itself just like an institution, and eventually becomes solely concerned with maintaining its continued existence. I actually perceive the addiction as a kind of conscious entity living inside of my body that, if it stops getting food, it sees its death. anything that doesn't want to die is like that -- weight or sickness, whatever. it tricks you to maintain its existence.

so here's the thing with the identity: the identity that I give myself doesn't feel good because I'm not really that thing I identify myself as. I'm not really a patriots fan, starbucks connoiseur or reggae pothead (or whaver). those are not who I really am, so those things don't feel good. if you've ever had a psychedelic, NDE, or a life-changing spiritual experience, you know that you are much more than just your physical body. it doesn't feel good to try and convince yourself you are less than that.

so, what happens is I do the addiction and I don't feel good about what I'm doing because I'm saying, "this addiction is me; this is how I define myself." -- and that doesn't resonate with who you really are, so it feels bad -- or, at the least it doesn't feel right.

coming back to the chaos and the order thing, the idea that you have to do certain things that you may not want to do, and so therefore taking a toke (or whatevr) before starting the task, is just a way to feel better about doing something I don't want to do. however, it's a bit counter productive because it trains me to believe I need (or should reward myself with) the good-feeling fix to be able to do thing I don't feel good about doing further perpetuating the addiction.

I've had a lot of addictions in my life and I've never quit any of them with willpower. I only quit them because I found an alternative which felt better -- because eventually after a tolerance is built up, any addiction won't feel very good anymore, after a length of time. you don't need to wait till the addiction feels terrible though. it's difficult to keep finding better feeling things though.

what's been successful for me is to embrace the addiction. it seems like you'll do more of it, and you may in the sort-term but not in the long term. for example, if I'm smoking weed, then I find a way to feel good about it, and I feel good about smoking it. I decide that I'm only going to do things that feel good to me to do. eventually the stuff I have to do feels better than the addiction so I start to do that. having practised feeling good about stuff, I find the thing I had to do now enjoyable or easy.

if it's hard to feel good about the addiction or stuff I don't want to do, then that's where I invoke the power of perception. you can perceive (convince yourself) anything you want to is "right" -- so, why not use the same power to find a way to feel good about all the things that you're doing -- even the addictions? when you're only doing things that feel good to you, I assure you that it won't take long until you begin to notice the subtle difference between when you really (emotionally) feel good (serotonin?), vs when you feel (physical) pleasure (dopamine?).

so what ends up happening after I get used to feeling the way I want to feel about anything, naturally and gradually the addiction starts to fade into the background and I begin to become master of my experience. I can feel however I want to feel about anything I want to. this leads me right into the next thing I want to talk about next time, which is the difference between feeling a way because I forced/convinced myself to feel that way, vs. actually changing how I perceive it (think about bad trips here).

ok, now I'm going to go read your reply. I've been strugging to get the above section into words for a bit and I wanted to do that before I read your response...

I want to expand on the rightness and reason part. if you say anything true or false, you get a feeling response to it. if I say, "I am an idiot" then I that generates a feeling response -- and that feeling reaponse is your rightness/reason indicator. the hijacking your talking about are just simple beliefs. if you believe (have convinced yourself) that you are an idiot, that statement may feel good to you -- however deep down there's an even smaller feeling response that is your true self which doesn't feel good about that thought.

an addiction programs your brain to respond to the addictive stimulus and produce good-feeling (physical) response. the produce beliefs (as you say in the form of identity). hotwever, below these feeling responses the addiction has produced in your brain, you will notice below it, there is some emotional disharmony. that's what I'm talking about with the identity you've convinced yourself of. it isn't who you are and it doesn't feel as good as you think it does. many people run around saying things like, "I'm awkward" or "I'm stupid" and that's just an identity they're trying to convince theirseves of to cover up for something they feel out of control about (like an addiction).

anyway, I'm so glad I tried so hard to figure out that above part. I love addictions because they force you to figure yourself out. my idea to drive myself like an addiction, with feeling instead of action, is kind of a revolutionary idea. instead of trying to fight the addiction, why not just accept that I'm addicted to feeling good, then use my perception to feel good about anything :) I don't need to do things to feel good, I can just feel good and let my life reflect how I feel about myself :)

man, I really enjoyed writing this! take care man!

### 2021-05-04 01:04 - to john anthony

I'm pretty convinced that it's jupiter. the obvious visual indicator is the giant eagle above the crest of arms there. the eagle, hammer and thunderbolt is the symbol of jupiter, and the snake or sicle/sythe to saturn. either way, waugh claims that jonson designed the monument, and I fully agree. have a look at jonson's folio here: https://www.rct.uk/sites/default/files/collection-online/d/1/558833-1443687797.jpg

you will see two sets of twins (twice 11 brethren, imo), one female twins and the other male twins. they are identified, too: the one on the left is labeled, SATVR -- so, saturn. the one on the right is named "PASTOR". saturn is always a grain/harvest god and pastor is a shepherd. furthermore, the symbol for saturn is a goat playing some pipes (like capricorn, bacchus or dionysus).

the other one has to be jupiter. there's some weird symbolism going on in that folio there as well which I will point out. first, notice that the symbol (rod looking thing) on the crest with the eagle above the monument has the same shape as the rod the person in the centre of the folio is holding in their right hand. you will see the same rod on the bottom as well, also in the right hand of the woman on the side of tragedy. she's also wearing a crown. she's the queen, the heir.

so, now let's look at the other woman (on the comedy side). you'll notice that she's holding a wooden staff that reminds me a lot of a "shepherd's staff" in her left hand. that same staff is seen above, also in the left hand of the bacchus. the pastor however, shows a regal orament on his staff under his left leg, but look under his foot. it's a spade. sounds like the old picture of the monument waugh is showing in that video with father time pulling truth out of the earth.

I see and concur with waugh's explanation there but I want to offer a second layer of meaning. the spade is symbolic of effort or labour and refers to jupiter. to explain, let's look at the concept of value. we equate value with both effort and time. time, effort and quality are all units of measurment. in the alchemical process work/effort needs to be done and this takes time. once again time and space are the twins that are each necessary of each other. you can't have space without time, neither time without distance/space. these are the twins that appear separate but are perpendicular perspetives of the same thing. I refer to these as saturn (time) and jupiter (space). these are the two symbols on either side of the monument: the spade and the hourglass, referring to time and labour.

there may be more symbolism relating to the women twins there I believe jonson reveals in his play, "the magnetick lady" of the passing of the feminine heir from mr. compass (eg. Time, ref sonnet 116) to pleasance. look at the crown and rod.

### 2021-05-22 13:51 - to rupert zaryn and noah

hey rupert, I was goofing off just now with jaron and I suggested an idea that I wish there was a less friction way to get my ideas out onto a platform.

I decided that it would have the artificial restriction that you only get 15-20 seconds of pause time while writing and when the timer runs out, it automatically sends the idea -- no way to cancel it.

the network I supposed would be called "blurter" and each post would be a "blart".

the whole point of the idea is to artificially force people to get their ideas out there without thinking about them as much. each input to the text area would only allow one character input at a time so you couldn't just circumvent the idea by writing it all out then copy and pasting it in. I'm even considering the idea of never being able to delete any blarts either. it would create all kinds of really "funny" situations because imagine I grab your phone while you're not looking and I fire out a few blarts.. lol

anyway, I thought it was a pretty good idea and I'm not going to use it, so pass it on to someone who may want to use it. cheers!
