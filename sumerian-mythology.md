### sumerian mythology

- had 12 months * 3 weeks * 10 days = 36 weeks of 10 days for their 360 day year.
  - likely this was the orbit pre-deluge, and the 5 extra days were added on later after whatever cataclysm that caused this slowing of rotation speed

- enlil (jupiter) caused the deluge
  - related to the athenians
  - athena seems related to isis
  - isis seems related to sirius
  - weird myth involving a giant bird (anzu) that takes the tablet which grants enlil his authority

- enki (neptune)
  - could symbolise the sirian influence on earth.
  - has the symbol of a serpent
  - definitely related to atlantis (which seems to be the serpent bloodline)

- enkidu (humans)
  - in the epic of gilgamesh he is transformed into a human after a week (or two) of sex.
  - genetically engineered from the wild apes to be like the gods (enki)
  - name probably means, "of (or in the likeness of) enki"
