# god mode

this is a list of ultra powerful concepts and how to apply them to any moment to feel better. the inspiration for this is that sometimes going away stops working and sometimes conditions (drugs, sex, shopping, social media) stop working well as a distraction and the problem seems to become too big.

this is ***AT MOST*** a template. you have to make it your own for it to work. your way *will* be different than my way. I would like to think of this as preliminary efforts to create open source concepts: feel free to distribute, copy, modify, sell, whatever you want with this (Unlicense)

## optimising preception

### it's all attraction

the physical world doesn't lie. I am experiencing this situation because I attracted it.

### this situation is evidence of an emotional trend I've had going

I usually take a brief moment to notice the foreshadowing thoughts leading up to it and notice that these are the perceptions (manifest in thought) which brought me to this moment. these are the practised thoughts/reactions (programming) that I want to modify.

### it's just more energy

[TODO: insert understanding of every conflict or collision creating being more energy and how to get that erergy back into reality]

for whatever reason when I went to write them down just now. I totally (and very strangely) forgot them. it's my intention that new difficult siutations will arise in my life so that I can remember them.

### that [person/place/thing] is not responsible for how I feel

I can find ways to feel the way I want to feel. you're not responsible for that. you're a reflection of that. anything about you that doesn't feel good, means I'm resonant with that. if I weren't resonant with that, you would reflect how I feel instead.

### I can only feel things that I harmonise with

so, if it didn't feel good, I wouldn't have even noticed it if I weren't resonant with it.
you may be to blame, but it only became a thing because I resonate with how that feels.

### you would reflect how I feel if I weren't resonant to what you're doing

kind of another way to say the one previous, but it illustrates that it's bidirectional. if I feel bad and they're doing things that feel good to me, normally it would be expected for them to reflect the badness that I feel, however instead, because I resonate with the things they're doing (they feel good to me), therefore then in this moment I feel good, not bad.

-----------------------
## program your reality

I have noticed that *all reality* is a program. it's a conceptual program though and I interface with it with by inputting a feeling and then a feeling comes back out. I arrange, categorise and organise these feelings with thoughts (which are more like data structures).

these are some ideas that I have found useful and also things I would have wanted to know early on to get me started, too.

I will use a few different ideas interchangably:
- emotion = code = reality
- thought = data structures (with data) = details

when contemplating the idea that reality is an emotion and also code, consider the practical task of searching your brain for data. it's impossible to consider all data that you have ever noticed in the form of individual thoughts, so what I do is I writo some code (which is an emotion) that feels like what I'm looking for. I then let it work in the background while I'm doing other stuff. when the results have come back, I will feel the answer. I then have to speak it or think it (translate it into physical reality with words) to be able to retrieve the contents of the search. I like to think of my brain not as physical memory. I memorise almost nothing. instead, I just remember how to find what I'm looking for.

I perceive my brain as having an infinitely large address space (say 128 or 256 bits or something). unlimited space and it's like a KV storage. if I can remember the address I can get back to the concept. remembering the address is the hard part so I do things like link songs, visuals, symbols, or even full concepts or ideas to the concept stored in that space. I am certain that all of that data (experience, memories, etc.) isn't stored inside my brain. it's stored in the "cloud" (or collective conscsiousness, akasha, whatever you want to call it). that data is shared by everyone, and each concept has your own signature associated with it. fuzzy lookps are possible based on relevance, but you usually find your own concepts before you find someone else's unless you're a newborn or trying to explore someone else's memory space.

because there is so much data, it's impossible to find all of these things, so that you must now consider that every thing stored in this global memory is not data itself. the data is the physical details you seen, heard, touched, etc. recently. they are always relevant. instead, what is stored there are *concepts*. concepts are theirselves code, so they're always transforming, moving and changing thier position in the address space. a good way for me to think of this was those lua programs running in redis. they're addressable by key and can create/modify/delete/fetch other data before returning its result.

the address space is difficult to explain effectively because we don't have much like it, but instead imagine now a KV storage with compound keys. it's common to store data based on its id, so for example: user_id:comment_id:parent_comment_id:id would be one, and you could imagine those as individual keys so that in the db you could query for all comments by any of those fields and enumerate based on that. ok, so now imagine that in terms of reality. the composite keys new become symwols based on impact (or importance), so for example it may be something like: authority_type:interacts_with:subordinate_type, and all concepts which match that symbolic definition will return on the query in the order of most impactful/traumatic/important. each of these symbols are learned and are specific to the person. there are a lot of common "archetypes" which we will all share in society making the lookups between generations easier (this was originally developed as a method to transfer large blocks of ideas through generations through the common ideologies prevalent in the society).

however, to simplify this address space greatly for those inclined more toward sound, rhythm or vibration, they can instaed be thought of a composite set of notes (a chord or an orchestra) where each section of the orchestra playing will resonate with other sections the orchestra has played and other orchestras.

you can see how the programatic (KV storage) approach has more accuracy to the single moment, but is difficult to perceive each program's changes to the database over time. however, when perceived as a sound, frequency, or orchestra, one can perceive how important the time element is. no change ever happens by itself. they are always a part of a symphony of other changes. in fact these movements should create wave-like patterns in the programs as everything is constantly reacting to everything else. remember, everything that's stored is code, not data. sure some of it looks like data, but they're more like code which produces data[^1].

---

another thing to note is that I define toughts here as data structures, yet that data is fed into what program. the program it's fed into is you and how you feel. I call this your perception. it interprets all of the data, and then spits out another *feeling* (so, more code). that code is then used to alter your traversal through time/reality. the way fou feel generates tho code to how you will react to those things. it gives you code which generates code, when then generates code. this traversal of the instructions in the code can be perceived as what we think of as "time".

contemplate that idea because I'm saying that you are generating your own time with your own code which is your perception, your reactions, etc. jumps are certainly possible but the jumps jump to similar address spaces. you can think of the increment of the instruction pointer (EIP) as going to the next address which is similar to the presetnt EIP. think of the EIP as your present position in the global emotional space.

imagine you are at one concept in space. that program runs, and it causes you to feel the same (but slightly more intense) so another very similar program (or the same one) will run right after that. to avoid infinite loops, you have extra code to break you out of the loops (distractions, etc), but in general you will find yourelf continuing to run (over and over) similar programs that exist in that address space. you can design programs (I call them interrupts) which will break this loop or even alter or recognise undesireable parts of the address space. each time a program is run it increases the intensity of the present. I think we need 3d addreass space. I'll come back to this.

the best programs move you to another part of the address space. there's no sense in continuing to keep running the same program unless you *want* it to intensify. diversity of programs creates for a richer experience. 

[1]: anyone familiar with the demo scene will recognise this technique as a way to generate vast ammounts of data using a very small amount of code.

[TODO: explain that later, this faculty transforms and intentional feeling (input) can produce thoughts as (output). for example, if you can convince yourself that you are able to figure anything out, then in any moment when you don't feel that way don't dispair, it'll come back and you will figure it out. thoughts and emotions are both inputs and outputs]

## it's easier to recognise things you don't like about yourself in other people

everything is a reflection of how you feel and you can only perceive the things that you resonate with, so if something bothers you about someone else, it's very likely that you do the same annoying thing too. either way, you wouldn't notice it if it didn't annoy you, so there's an easy perception to change. the more you stop disapproving of ether people's behaviour, you'll find that you'll begin to start liking yourself.


-------------------------------------
## embrace conflict and confrontation

... after all, it's just more energy. if you know how to get it back into your realify, you can perceive these conflicts more like a dojo or a training exercise.


-----------------
## boost your ego

reality is a reflection of how you feel. the most important feeling you have is about yourself. everyone else will feel about you the same way you feel about yourself.

find ways to think of yourself highly
find ways to feel good about yourself
  - congratulate yourself when things go well
  - congratulate yourself when things go bad too (and don't let it bother you -- it's just more energy, anyway)
value yourself and your contribution to the moment
find ways to like yourself
  - find yourself smart
  - find yourself beautiful
  - find yourself funny
  - enjoy being with yourself

go over the top if you want:
feel your importance in the moment


really, take it to the limit... only people who are douchbags will perceive you as a douchebag. they ca
