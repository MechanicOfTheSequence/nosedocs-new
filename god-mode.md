# god mode

this is a list of ultra powerful concepts and how to apply them to any moment to feel better. the inspiration for this is that sometimes going away stops working and sometimes conditions (drugs, sex, shopping, social media) stop working well as a distraction and the problem seems to become too big.

this is ***AT MOST*** a template. you have to make it your own for it to work. your way *will* be different than my way. I would like to think of this as preliminary efforts to create open source concepts: feel free to distribute, copy, modify, sell, whatever you want with this (Unlicense)

------------------------
## optimising preception

### it's all attraction

the physical world doesn't lie. I am experiencing this situation because I attracted it.

### this situation is evidence of an emotional trend I've had going

I usually take a brief moment to notice the foreshadowing thoughts leading up to it and notice that these are the perceptions (manifest in thought) which brought me to this moment. these are the practised thoughts/reactions (programming) that I want to modify.

### it's just more energy

[TODO: insert understanding of every conflict or collision creating being more energy and how to get that erergy back into reality]

for whatever reason when I went to write them down just now. I totally (and very strangely) forgot them. it's my intention that new difficult siutations will arise in my life so that I can remember them.

### that [person/place/thing] is not responsible for how I feel

I can find ways to feel the way I want to feel. you're not responsible for that. you're a reflection of that. anything about you that doesn't feel good, means I'm resonant with that. if I weren't resonant with that, you would reflect how I feel instead.

### I can only feel things that I harmonise with

so, if it didn't feel good, I wouldn't have even noticed it if I weren't resonant with it.
you may be to blame, but it only became a thing because I resonate with how that feels.

### you would reflect how I feel if I weren't resonant to what you're doing

kind of another way to say the one previous, but it illustrates that it's bidirectional. if I feel bad and they're doing things that feel good to me, normally it would be expected for them to reflect the badness that I feel, however instead, because I resonate with the things they're doing (they feel good to me), therefore then in this moment I feel good, not bad.

-----------------------
## program your reality

I have noticed that *all reality* is a program. it's a conceptual program though and I interface with it with by inputting a feeling and then a feeling comes back out. I arrange, categorise and organise these feelings with thoughts (which are more like data structures).

these are some ideas that I have found useful and also things I would have wanted to know early on to get me started, too.

[TODO: explain that later, this faculty transforms and intentional feeling (input) can produce thoughts as (output). for example, if you can convince yourself that you are able to figure anything out, then in any moment when you don't feel that way don't dispair, it'll come back and you will figure it out. thoughts and emotions are both inputs and outputs]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## it's easier to recognise things you don't like about yourself in other people

everything is a reflection of how you feel and you can only perceive the things that you resonate with, so if something bothers you about someone else, it's very likely that you do the same annoying thing too. either way, you wouldn't notice it if it didn't annoy you, so there's an easy perception to change. the more you stop disapproving of ether people's behaviour, you'll find that you'll begin to start liking yourself.


-------------------------------------
## embrace conflict and confrontation

... after all, it's just more energy. if you know how to get it back into your realify, you can perceive these conflicts more like a dojo or a training exercise.


-----------------
## boost your ego

reality is a reflection of how you feel. the most important feeling you have is about yourself. everyone else will feel about you the same way you feel about yourself.

find ways to think of yourself highly
find ways to feel good about yourself
  - congratulate yourself when things go well
  - congratulate yourself when things go bad too (and don't let it bother you -- it's just more energy, anyway)
value yourself and your contribution to the moment
find ways to like yourself
  - find yourself smart
  - find yourself beautiful
  - find yourself funny
  - enjoy being with yourself

go over the top if you want:
feel your importance in the moment


really, take it to the limit... only people who are douchbags will perceive you as a douchebag. they ca
