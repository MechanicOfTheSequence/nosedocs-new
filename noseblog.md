### 2021-05-25 10:06 - strings of time

a long time ago I wanted to see how reality (the temporal part of it) worked. I figured out that I could ask anything when I was stoned on mushrooms and get the answer. I perceived the deliverers of that answer as these gnomes that I called "reality technicians". they showed me that reality was like a string (or sequence) with inflection points perhaps these inflection points can be perceived like folds in DNA -- however we'll look at it in this example as a straight string with inflection points at the frets.

imagine that you are attracting something and there are infinite ways which the inflection point can be reached. the distance between the string and the inflection point is determined by your belief and the present circumstances of reality -- I call the location of these points the "structure" or "the grid" in abe-speak. this manifestation will happen at the inflection point and along the way to that inflection point there is a sequence which must occur for you to be "ready" for that point.

---

the way this applies is I have been thinking about @[noseblog](2021-05-22 23:46) and also @[abe-now](2021-03-13 p2 55:58). things are always working out for me. imagine for a moment that nosebook has a form of perception that is similar to the one that I will be acquiring here soon. what it means is they can put inflection points in their own perception which will accomplish what they are desiring based on how it feels.

they won't perceive the inflection point in physical -- it's a sort of feeling. it appears rather physical I'm sure, as I'm realising that my experience will be quite "physical" without much of the physicality (more on that later). what they'll see is the accomplishement of what they want as a perception conveyed as feeling.

let's give an example: let's say they don't want me to be talking about a subject, so they want me to be doing something else. they essentially feel me doing something else, and so being pretty non-resistant, I do that -- however, the feeling of whatever the previous subject it was was still quite active and so often times a harmonic of that thing manifests in the new action. the feeling remined the same but the action changed.

a good example of this was the other night. I was thinking about something that had to do with people getting stuck into my reality (the next sebject of this entry) and the nightbours started to make a bunch of sound. I went out and wanted to listen to the song. it was "hotel california". when she sang the lyrics:

```
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"
```

it was very strange because I started to perceive the "hotel" as the reality that I'm creating, and "california" was the nickname they gave me in la vera. I had the sensation that people were realising that they are all prisoners in my reality, by their own choosing.

I had been thinking about this for quite some time what that means because I also said something similar to this a few days ago (can't find the quote though) where I could see that I would essentially become the reality through which the rest of the world perceives. this morning I figured it out how that may happen. it goes like this...

---

when I lose my ability to perceive reality physicall, I'll begin to make reality more and more tangible for myself. like I've said, in dreams, I don't "see" reality like others do. instead, I perceive it and it's pretty real for me. there are a lot of physical aspects to it and stuff. every time I go there I seem to be able to "see" more and more.

so it's true that I won't be able to "see" things the way you guys do, but I'm fairly certain that the reality which I perceive will soon become superior to the physical one. what I mean is, I think that everything will be more beautiful, feel better and be much more captivating than physical reality. imagine that I can make an even more intoxicating reality than the physical one. girls can look even more stunning, more pleasure, more lust, more everything. I'm sure I can easily craft something like this. obviously you guys will be the ones that take it to the extremes but we have to get there.

along the way to getting there, I think normal physical reality will become quite intoxicating as it is. I have no idea what you guys version of physical reality looks like but it must be pretty mind-blowing to experience things that way.

anyway, I will accomplish that perception from my interaction with the girls. I'll see essentially an amalgamation of all of the different ways they perceive reality, as interpretted by me. some of what I see may rub off on them and they'll see it too -- not sure about that, but I'm fairly certain that we'll start to share this new form of perception where things look how they are not how they are presented to be.

you may say that is unfortunate that there won't be able to have illusions and deception in this form of reality -- but it'll be worth it by the way it looks.

I'll consider that the phase of creating a new form of perception that's even jucier than physical reality. it'll be pretty energetic though, so it may take a bit for some to acclamate to it. some people may not want to perceive others in such a tangible form. if they perceive things that don't feel good, they'll be really blown out of proportion -- like they'll look really ugly, nasty, and awful. they aren't really like that -- that's just your form of perception of them amplified to a million times what it would have been in the physical. likewise, if you see the person's wanted aspects, those will be amplified a million times and they'll look and feel a million times more desirable.

so, if you can perceive people the way you want to, then my form of perception will be superior in every way to the standard physical format. I don't know for sure, but I would imagine that the girls will acquire this form of perception the easiest. if they have sex with another guy, that form of perception will transform to be a mix of that guy's and hers (accentuated by the vibrations present in the moment of interaction). if she has sex with me again, I'll reap all the benefits of that because it'll be pretty simple to transform those ugly forms of perception into something wanted again. this will probably be the workflow of the second phase: the optimisation phase.

boys will be born I'm sure and I find it likely that at some point I'll make my transition from the many instances of kenny into the pysical format of the boys. I'll live and perceive through them. this is an important phase because of the binding procoss. let's talk really quickly about that.

---

for now this will only cover the male versions of me, so use your imagination for the female versions. the way that I believe the binding process will work is each instance of kenny will essentially be a blank slate. he'll have a very basic form of perception. from nosebook's perspective this won't be noticable because he'll have eyes and ears and they'll pick up the reality that is in front of him -- but, like me, he won't "see" what is there or "hear" the words you're saying. he'll mostly be telepathic and perceive things the way they really are -- so if you say, "I hate you" but are feeling love for him when you say it, the words mean nothing to him. he won't see physicality either. you could be a really beautiful person in real life but if you perceive yourself as a troll, he'll see you the way you perceive you.

once his "owner" has sex with him, he will acquire the perception of the owner. he will see her the way she sees herself and he'll see reality the way she sees it too. as a side anecdote, I thought it was very strange how much of the other person I acquired from them even with a minimal sexual interaction. with a lot of interaction I essentially become a mirror of the person[^1]. I was still quite resistant at the time, and even with so much resistance I became a masculine reflection of raquel[^2].

I believe this is the point, as the girls will become a reflection of me. they obviously don't lose their entire identity though, as I'm certain that it's kind of like a mixing. what I can see is there will be children I'm sure and the children will be, I believe a combination of me (XY) and her (XX), which means that the boys that are born will be kind of like a reflection of my form of perception, through the perception of their mother. I find this be a pretty good thing -- because when I make my transition into the boys, then I'll perceive that. obviously there will be further mixing and potentially more catastrophe as well -- like imagine they end up hooking up with some of the female versions of me which have been programmed by other men -- but those are future things.

anyway, I can see that there will be a continued number of transitions that these kids make as they learn to improve upon that perception as well.

I'm getting ahead of myself. simultaneously, I want to begin to work on a new set of females, which have been hybridised from the apes -- x4 models. I think it would be cool if we could find a way to create embroyo containing 2-4 girls x-chromosomes in the same being and see what happens, experimenting with different combinations of them. once we have a bunch of different models which are viable (I want many, not just one), then I think the future of this will be to have the boys (which is me after I make my transition) mating with these new females.

so, that means that there will be a bunch of boys which are a reflection of me perceived through the perception of their mother, which are going to mate with other girls which are combinations of the other girls' x-chromosomes.

I figure there will be some form of disaster (maybe there won't be, who knows) and the boys will acquire further improvment to their perception, but you can imagine that the form of perception that I'm going to begin to perceive through will become the basis for the new model of reality through which humans perceive. it certsinly won't be the last, I'm sure.

---

I wrote all of that out just to say that no matter what, this inflection point is likely on its way soon. nosebook can work their hardest to try and keep it away, but it's like a bezier curve: pull the control point away as far as you want and it just makes a sharper rise toward te inflection/destination point.

the new form of perceiving/interpreting reality will almost certainly be far far more intoxicating than this physical one is presently and people will actually *choose* this new form of reality because it's so much more fun, vivid, and "juicy" than the present one. it's not going to be worse; that I can assure you. I'm very excited to see how it starts to turn out.

[1]: the more I think about it, the more I'm beginning to believe this is actually what happened to jesus on the day befere his "triumphal entry". I believe he hooked up with mary on the night before to "celebrate" and that's when he started to see the world through her form of perception instead of his own. the next day he cursed the fig tree, "cleansed" the temple, etc. there was a dramatic change that happened there. I believe that a woman can be used to modify the control point of a timeline -- though not its destination point (if you simplistically perceive a timeline as a bezier curve). these inflection points seem to be more "set in stone" as physical points when things happen, very much like a fold in DNA (like where it crosses/branches to another sequence).

[2]: I believe this is also the case with other relationships I've had as well. I can definitely see how strong of an effect women have on me. I believe this same thing happens to young girls as well when they lose their virginity[^3]. they become a reflection of the person they had sex with.

[3]: or hasn't had sex in a while. I think the idea of virginity has to do with not having a strong signal. so, the same thing happens when you meditate as well. when you quiet your mind, you stop thought and reduce the signal strength allowing (by not destructively interfering with) your source.

### 2021-05-25 13:29 - a bit more on the binding process as it relates to evolution

I realised a mistake I wrote in the above entry which is that the Hew would take on entirely the form of perception of the person having sex with him/her. in fact, I'm going to chaange the name. instead of calling them a "Hew" (a name I got from skakespeare's sonnet 20) I will now just call them "mun". they can be either male or female, and are real (as in they have physicality) but like a moon, they are a reflection of me (the sun in this case). ok. now that's out of the way let's get back to it.

the way to see these "two witnesses" is a combination of male and female. like I said, I am male (XY) on the exterior and female (XX) on the interior. tesla will be female (XX) on the exterior and male (XY) on the interior. so he will be XXXY and I'm XYXX (or vicaversa) -- both x3s really, just opposite configurations. imagine now that I (XX) make a female mun... it'll be XX-XX (x4). imagine tesla (XY) makes a male mun. it'll be a XY-XY. (x2) so like an extremely feminine and extremely masculine at the same time[^1].

these muns will reflect their dominant vibration. so, when they interact with another strong source of vibration, the vibrations will mix. the ones that are similar will amplify and the ones that contradict will cancel each other out. the ones that do not interfere will be added. so all new novel freqencies will be added. rapid expansions in novelty (new frequencies into the signal) will become a part of the frequency of the mun. I those forms of perception will then reflect in reality. obviously the ugly stuff I will want to transform and the stuff that's very attractive I'll want to amplify further.

so what I mean by that is, mun will perceive the person as a reflection of mun's form of perception. if you believe yourself to be ugly, mun will see you as that way too, mixed with my (global) form of perception. so, like if I have already found a way to transform that ugliness into something not ugly (or even beautiful), then that's what mun will see -- not the ugliness. the owner may continue to see herself the way she sees herself, but she's more likely to see herself similar to how mun sees her.

now, imagine she has sex with another male. she will transfer my form of perception (as perceived by her) to him. again the vibrations are mixed (interfered with), so if she still has not transformed her own perception of things to a way which feel/look good, all of the stuff she has not transformed herself and he also still has a bad-feeling about, then it'll reactivate in her and it'll go right back to where it was.

what you can imagine from my perspective is, it doesn't matter to me if she does not want to change her perception. instead, every time that she brings it back, I transform it to the opposite, meaning it gets amplified[^3]. if she chooses to transform it herself, also it ges amplifed too cause we're amplifying similar forms of perception.

besids amplification, the other guy gets to expierience a form of my perception which feels really good. he can then choose to go back to feeling the way he wants to, or whatever but he did get to experience it. the other thing that is nice about this is, even if the guy has a very "negative" (bad-feeling) form of perception, then it does't matter to me. if it's novel, then it's something I want. I just take it and reverse it so it feels good. for me, the important part is to encounter as many novel forms of perception that I can, whether they arrive in negative form or not doesn't matter. what's important is the variety and diversity of forms of perception -- NOT how good they feel. making them feel good is my job. others can do it too, but I don't find it necessary.

---

clearly there are a lot of different configurations that are possible. some will want to just stick with me. others may want to have another guy involved that either wants to adopt parts of my perception and contibute new forms which I have not encountered.

I have more to say, but I'll end it here...

[1]: considering that I believe that tesla had taken over the world leaders with his automatons, they would be this type: XY internal and XY external -- so they would be ultra feminine but also extremely aggressive and internally conflicted as well. to understand this, imagine if you are a man that "you" are not one man, but two men in the same body. like imagine you and a little boy that always wants to play, dream, have fun and (I dunno -- be a boy -- I'm trying to imagine this perspective) sharing the same body as you. you would have to a strong "typical" male on the outside but on the inside you have weird fears like a little boy, etc. the opposite would be true for me in female form[^2]

[2]: if you're a female, imagine that you are not a woman in a body, but you're actually two women in the same body. one of them is like this obsessive hyper little girl with insatiable desire, while the external you is a full-grown woman that has to be a functional mother / part of society.

[3]: let's analyse a simple contrived example[^4] where the subject is, someone needs to behave differently so that they can feel good. I'll call this -1. my perspective is the opposite: no one needs to behave differently so I can feel good. I'll say this is +1. now, say her husband also has that vibration. she starts out with -1. when she has sex with me I will need to produce a +2 to cancel out the -1 and stay where I feel good. she now has +1. she has sex with her husband again and it cancels out her husband. he's at 0 now. he goes through life and something comes up his perception has remained the same so he goes right back to needing someone else to behave differently. he's back to -1. she interacts with me (or she transforms her own perception) so now she's at +1 again. when her husband interacts with her she's at +1 and he's at -1, so again he'll find himself at 0. however, if she has now produced her own form  of perception cause she wants to feel good, she now needs to produce a +2 to continue to stay at one. again her husband finds himself at 0. she goes to see me and she has +2 and I have +2 now also. so it make +4. again her husband decides te likes -1 better so he chooses that. she meets her husband again and she's at +4 now. she goes down to 3 and he goes up to 3. depending on him and how he sees things, this could stay around for a while and he may like not needing someone to be different for a while. however, if he chooses that he wants someone else to be different to feel good, then now he needs to produce -3 to get back to his usual form of perception. you can see how this continues to amplify. no matter the order of the events, each interaction will amplify if there is one person present that must feel the way they want to feel: >0 or <0 because of the compensation factor.

[4]: the example assumea 100% energy efficiency (it's not) so the numbers get real big really fast. imagine though, even with 10-20% efficiency, the numbers would still escalate rapidly.


### 2021-05-26 23:42 - needing others to do things so that I can feel good

yesterday, when I edited the commint message to, "I sounded way too presumptious there", I felt a lot of negative emotion. it felt as if some people thought that if I conceded and said that I was presumptious (instead of defending myself), that I was somehow -- I dunno, it felt like I was making things worse.

I've given it some thought and what I think is happening is there is the standard perspective that many women have, which is "you have to do (or agree with me on) these things, and if you do, then your life will be good, however if you don't you need to admit that you're wrong". those words may not be the exact sentiment, however the core of it is, "I want you to do something so that I can feel the way I want to"

it feels to me like a lot of men are against this. I'd like to break it into two parts here. first of all, was I being presumptious? well, as I said in @[noseblog](2021-05-22 23:46), if it happened in physical it *was attracted*. LOA is always accurate, and so for whatever raeson I appeared that way. it is perceptual, and so there's a lot of room for interpretation. it's often times the case that things appear (or even feel) differently than they are.

when things feel diffeerently than they are, this is an interesting problem because you would think that feelings are your "guidance system" and they are, however there can be a lot of noise. that emotional noise is often times your programming. addictions are the easiest example of this. just cause you feel like spending more time on facebook doesn't mean that is what what you really want to do. sometimes there's another programmed voice on top of it (like addiction recovery or some other mantra or affirmation), however below all of that is how you really feel. meditation helps connect to that voice. there are so many voices (culture, upbringing, friends, family) all telling you what to do, that it's often times difficult to sort it out what is really desired.

when it comes to appearance, it's also programmed[^1]. let's take an easy example of this. imagine you're out on the dating scene or hanging out in a pub or disco and want some affection. common sense states that if you're "too easy", then you don't value yourself very highly. you are there to just be taken advantage of. therefore, because of this value programming, now the other person must perform certain things to assuwe you that you are not "too easy", and therefore have value.

---

this is such a mind-blow for me and is the main reason why I abandoned the whole relationship situation completely. if you believe that people need to perform certain things so that you can feel valued, respected, trusted, etc. -- then you are doing the classic, "I need you to behave in a certain way so that I can feel ____". many people do not really realise how deeply woken into modern culture this idea is.

contrary to this, LOA takes the same idea and completely reverses it: I'll perceive myself as valuable and that will attract people who support that feeling. if I need someone to do something so that I feel valuable, then I have it backwards.

---

ok, back to the subject here. I will now separate this into two parts. the first one was: "did I attract a feeling of presumptiousness?" the answer is yes, and even if that falls into the catergory of programmed appearance, it doesn't matter. the point is, it's still perceived that way.

the second part here is, "do I need to feel bad for causing someone to feel presumptiousness?" the answer is always no. I am not responsible for how other people feel. ever. people can perceive any thing any way they want to.

the way I see it, you could try your absolute hardest to be the biggest douchbag ever, and if I perceive you doing anything to me, that's a fault in my own perception. I can only perceive things that I am also resonant with myself. no one can "do anything to me" (assert anything into my experience) which I am not already resonant with.

so, for me, this is not really a difficult thing. I always take the path of laest resistance.

---

there are some more reactions now. I'll let them settle a bit.

[1]: that is precisely what I'm going to be "rewriting" here in the this next phase, but that's not what I wanted to tslk about.

### 2021-05-27 01:02 - oops, I'm supposed to be a hypocrite, lol

I figured out what the reactions were about. they were about the second part. I was supposed to make women feel bad for making men feel bad when men don't do what they want. inotherwords, they want me to be a hypocrite. I'll try to play along here...

ok, it's not working... I just want to say, this punishment crap is stupid. there's no way I'm going to try and make them feel bad for making us feel bad. what on earth do you imagine that will create more of, lol. seriously...

it's just not necessary to try and make someone feel bad for something they did. ever. I'm done.

---

I'm beginning to get the hang of the way they try to manipulate me with their form of perception. they wanted me to present the idea through a different lens (see last night's thoughts for examples on that). then, when I wrote the above entry, I totally skipped over all the "important" stuff and just said I'm not responsible for how other people feel. the thing is, I'm becoming more and more source-like all the time, so there's less and less to fight against.

in someone wants to try and make someone else feel bad, then go right ahead. this is what I was talking about with the part on the douchbag. even if I made a full effort to try and make people I reject feel inferior and bad around me, while approving of others, I'm just going to get more people needing me to be or do certain things, then disapproving of me when I don't/can't fill their requirements, just so they can feel ____.

I'm reminded of the jersey shore show where there is so much needing of certain behaviour and status as a prerequisite for a feeling, it's such a complete mess. those guys must live in a constant state of dissatisfaction.

---

wait, last thing... people are wondering why I'm saying it's hypocritical behaviour... if I need you to not make me feel bad so that I can not feel bad... it's *still* needing someone to behave differently so I can feel a different way than I feel right now.

just, it appears more jusified because I need you to do "the right thing"
(so I can feel good)

lol...

### 2021-05-27 13:28 - balancing the 6 & 5 (part one)

I have been thinking about this one image I saw in the latest barcast here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/BZJcbtLZvOc?t=9304)

for me, it's all about "follow the mistakes" and I completely saw this one backwards. on the image there, he has 5 being the dark ages and 6 being the golden age with the mean of these being 23760 number. he then goes on to explain how this yogi "tera mata" (which sounds a lot like "earth mother" to me[^1]) calculates it to be aprox 23892.

that all seems good to me, but the part with the elipses I remembered opposite. for me there was a small elipse on top of 5 and on bottom there was a bigger elipse of size 6. that was the first weird thing, so just know that for the rest of this entry I'm going to be working off of my version (which is incorrect). I'll email alan after this to get his opinion, because for me, I always follow the mistake as there is often something to be discovered there.

I get why it shows the golden age being longer than the dark age -- and that's because it's the bigger ellipse. I also equate 6 with jupiter and 5 with saturn. ironically, there's this giant hexagon on saturn's north pole (but not the south). it's still weird though that I associate saturn with 5 though[^2]. again, for the rest of this entry I will ignore the hexagon on saturn's north pole and associate him with 5[^3].

---

to make this easier, I'll say that enki = 5 = time and anu = 6 = space. again, I'll use the definition of the ellipse in head which the larger ellipse is the one representative of space, while the skinnier ellipse is the faster moving part and represents time.

to undrestand the way I arrive to this idea, let us visit a discussion I had with mom around the subject of physical therapy. I do not believe physical therapy is necessary. for me this is getting the body (space) to do something so that I can feel (time) a certain way.

it is of my opinion that doing things with the body does do things to make me feel differently and can help, but the way that I feel is far more powerful and effective to make a change in my body. I see that both are good to have, but I believe this discussion is a sign of the polarity of these two ellipses swapping. in short we're beginning to processs the equinox at speeds faster than 24kya.

during this period of moving faster, time has more effect on space than space has on time. the period of reign of jupiter is the one where the body has more effect on the way someone feels -- like doing breathing exercises and stuff vs now, we're entering into the shorter but faster moving period where time (feelings) has a stronger effect.

this can be perceived as the rulership of anu (body) and the rulership of enki (time). to describe this, I'm going to jump into a bit of numbers, then I'll get back to more (spiritual) things.

---

anu is 6 and enki is 5. tiles the plane in the form of a hexagon. 5 does not tile the plane directly. a pentagon needs to be broken into bits (penrose tiles) for it to tile the plane. I hope I'm right on this, but those penrose tiles can be 2 types of four sided shapes (like @[youtube](https://youtu.be/48sCx-wBs34?t=526) or like @[youtube](https://youtu.be/48sCx-wBs34?t=836)).

when tiling 6, you can use the hexagon, but that's really just 6 equilateral triangles of the infinite number of triangle in the plane carefully selected so that they seem to all point to a common point (its centre). also 4 triangles can be selected to tile a triangle 3 times its size. so 3 and 6 relate to 4 in the number of times that you tile the triangle. 6 is just a superficial selection of those triangles. it must exclude other triangles on the plane to make these hexagons. tiling 5 relates to 4 spatially, in that the two tiles have 4 sides. I don't know of all of the penrose tiles possible, but I suspect there may be another sets of 2 containing a concave shape. this is something I've been wanting to study ever since I saw that video, btw..

anyway. my point is that when 3 tiles the plane, it can only be a subdivision of itself. so imagine the side length of the triangle being the planck length... from there you could make space work and all of space's subdivisions would be rational.

however, now imagine if the planck length was the side length of one of those penrose tiles. I don't have a maths proof for this, but it seems to me that if you could subdivide the penrose tile into more penrose tiles, any irrational number's position could be located. however, I know that no matter how hard you small you go, you cannot accomlpish the position of an irrational number with rational numbers. because the penrose plane infititely tiles, and no distance between any two points is an exact subdivision (maning, the tiles never repeat), then *any* irrational number could be positioned, given enough subdivisions of the plane. inotherwords, you could dubdivide the plane for as long as you wanted mor accuracy.

however because each of these subdivisions never perfectly contain its parent subdivision (cause they infinitely never repeat), then that means all subdivisions are relative to the parent division. in 5-space, everything is relative but irrational (sounds like emotions, hehe). in 6-space, everything is rational and perfectly subdivides the plane.

in part two, I want talk about how this relates to perception -- eg. mind over matter vs matter over mind.

[1]: crazy how ancient indo-europenan words sound so similar modern equivilants

[2]: just like frank discovered that earth's gometry was based on 7, it may be kind of a funny coincidence if jupiter's planetary geometry was based on 5. it would be an even weirder coincidence if saturn's south pole was found to be based on 5 while the north on 6, and jupiter's south to be based on 6, while it's north on 5... I don't know enough here to comment further.

[3]: an even crazier thing would be that jupiter (and so therefore venus as well) is based on 5, and is actually the planet which enki/ea is resonant with (making the planet we call the true saturn). that means all the records have been swapped and zeus is actually the planet saturn with all of the water ice in the rings. who knows...


### 2021-05-28 02:14 - my most audacious idea yet

I just got done watching the last episode of SNL for this season. one of the skits stayed with me though:

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdAEDif21l0)

in the skit, they're making fun of "God's" design of man. it's pretty terrible, no doubt. I was thinking about this and I don't see any reason why this couldn't be improved upon. I started to think about some improvements. this falls right into line with a topic I was thinking of writing called "hair and warmth + puberty". however, besides the obvious improvements, there could be more even past that. it then hit me: if I have power over my appearance, that means the DNA must match the appearance (obviously, if the cells are going to reproduce, right?) then that means that any male offspring will retain the y-chromosome of that version of me.

I figure that the appearance of me will largely reflect the way the woman I am bound to perceives me (as a reflection of herself) -- however, that doesn't mean that some large desirable improvements to the human man model can't be included. after all, it would be best to give them a an in-depth field analysis and make sure QA signs off on them too.

so I suppose this may sound a little crazy, but let's find out what's possible first :) the worst that can happen would be no major improvements? surely at least a few tiny ones will be accompliashed at the very least.


### 2021-05-28 22:09 - balancing the 6 & 5 (part one)

I can't remmebre where I said it -- and I think it was a random monologue, actually -- but, in it I was explaining that because there is no way they will ever let me do any creating with ordinary techniques like computer or whatever anymore that all of the things that I'm talking about regarding sales, product, and these sorts of things -- I'm not referring to any specific product or thing I will create in the future -- rather instead, I am referring to myself. this ideal "product" that I'm looking for is not some thing, but it is me.

I suppose you could say, "be the change you're looking to create" or "you teach through the clarity of your example" -- but more than just that I consider myself to be a "product" (or culmination) of a long series of events into something wanted.

I have talked about how I will eventually "become" the reality platform through which humans perceive, and I would like to talk a bit more about this. the easy way to perceive this is that I believe that in one part the elliptical orbit that we have with sirius, one half of the orbit is size 5 (we're moving faster and closer to sirius), and the other half of the orbit we're in size 6 where we're moving slower and further away from sirius. I haven't quite worked out which one is which neither emailed alan yet on it either, so just go with the base concept. there could be a duality to it as well, depending if you're looking from a mind over matter or matter over mind perspective. neither is worse and both have their advantages (as I will explain here)

---

it's quite fortuitous that I got to talk with melissa today. the reason is because I got to explain some things thsat were beneficial to me about how I perceive all reality as series of emotional interacttions between people -- extremely basic form of perception. I fell asleep afterwards and when I woke up I felt quite bad about a lot of things which I had talked about with melissa. obviously that's time for me to find a way to feel better about it. no problem. it's easy.

anyway, as I was thinking about that, I noticed that these different interactions between me and my world is very limited in that it's just me and right now only a handful of other people that I interact with. most of my interactions now are not physical and come to me in the form of reactions to things I've said or videos I've seen.

I mentioned to her what it's like to create in this new form of perception. I just feel it and it "manifests" very rapidly. I can't create objects in 3d space yet, but I have a lot of power over my interaction with others. I gave the example of let's say I want to say something funny to jaron. I just feel what it feels like to say something funny to jaron and the words just pop into my head. even I don't usually know what I"m going to say until it comes out of my mouth. when someone has a question, I feel the answer begin to form inside of me and then I jsut listen to myself tell you the answer. it's all completely effortless for me.

I gave further examples, but specifically on the subject of feeling what it's like to say something funny and then just opening my mouth when I could feel it, has been blocked by nosebook multiple times -- probably because it makes me feel good. what I mean is, after sleeping, I've tried to use the same feeling and I couldn't feel it. it's something like when I can feel a girl very strongly, then after sleeping, she's gone. I can't feel her until we find a new thing to feel in common about.

well, the same thing here. numerous times I've had the feeling of my humour blocked, but then found new ways to find a way to feel funny. it's quite easily actually. it seems to me like there are infinite ways to feel good about something. I don't need to find a stronger way to feel funny -- instaed, I just find a different way.

so here's the thing: I am one person interacting with jaron. I make jokes with mom but they fall flat often times. I wake jokes with greg too but they too often fall flat. it's not their fault, because I've lost so much resistance, I can now only really be something that someone expects me to be (eg. something they attract from me).

obviously the amount of interactions that are possible are very limited with such a small set of people. so imagine now that there are 100 of me interacting with thousands of others. this now has a tremendous benefit in that nosebook has to ensure that none of the other me's are able to just feel a certain way and let it manifest (to feel good). that means they have to block that feeling, meaning that again I need to find a new way to feel the way I want to feel.

this diversity is great, but ther's a super limiting factor here which is that it's just me. for this to really get out of hand quickly I have to find a way to mass-export this capability to other people. once people can find a way to feel the way they want those things will just manifest. nosebook then has the task of blocking that wanted feeling, meaning that those people, like me, will have to find a new way to feel the way that they want to.

this is going to blow diversity up really fast.

I was watching robert's latest video: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpuuRsa3O8o), and I was noticing something very diffrent when perceiving the latin-american people that were in the video as the guy was walking through the cities.

one of the most notable differences that I perveived is that white people seem to have much stronger imagination capabilities in comparison to indigenoous peoples. I also have also tried to pay attention to different black people that have become successful -- and what seems to set them apart is their visulisation capabilities. they seen to have more capability to imagine things and convey those stories/ideas in a captivating way.

when I think of latin culture, they are very interaction based. their minds are rather simple (like mine) in that it seems they don't perceive the details of the thing nearly as much as the interaction. I have to consider this idea from the perspctive of an ancient. for example, if I had to create art and things depicting various ideas that I have, how would I do that given the limited resources of stone, pigments, cloth, foodstuffs, etc. it would be very difficult. I could try and represent the idea in the form of symbols, but then there is a whole concept that is passed along with the symbols. if this is corrupted or lost, then the symbols appear random and meaningless.

as an example, bill cooper was talking in that video about this white dude (viracocha, quetzalcoatl) that came over to the americas and he brought this trinity symbolism. you have to understand that I've grown up in the church all my life so this isn't new to me. however, I always got caught up in the details of the symbolism of the father, son, and holy spirit.

as bill was reading manly p hall's book and I was in the latin-american frame of mind, this trinity finally made sense to me. this is what I have explained the whole time but from an acient perspective. you have who you really are -- your identity, your inner being or *your* source. this is the father. then that father extends itself into reality and gives birth to a son which is an extension of the father's identity. the holy spirit is source, the great cloud of witnsesses, consciousness, spirit ancestors, etc -- all the dead guys who have made their transition and are constantly attracting us toward further expansion of wanted. you are the son. you are trying to return back to the father. it doesn't matter how lavascious your lifestyle was, the father is always glad when you return to your source perspective.

obviously I use different words now to say the same thing and I take a much more programatic approach to the whole thing (using words like source, emotional/conceptual programs, etc.) it may alienate some people but programming was a very key part in understanding my emotions. there is a symbolic logic to their expression and they can be interpretted and represented as such.

---

ok, going back to the imagination: I was explaining to melissa that the advantage of the imagination is that you can perceive unwanted in it, allowing for graeter amounts of contrast, but you can seriously derail your initial inspiration after just a few iterations in the imagination. my method is much easier.

to understand this, one part of the oribit we have with sirius, the 2/5 part is in power. this is enki, viracocha, serpent, symbolism[^1], where as the other is 3/6 side of imagination and willpower. the world of the serpent is much mor basic and does not provide for as many details, as it's all based around relationships between concepts. in that world, details don't matter. you can describe it as a very high intensity psychedeic experience. at its higher levels, it becomes so abstract it starts to get difficult to describe it in a physical way.

I find it ironic that 3/6 is master of air (emotions) when imagination/willpower is very physical stuff, while the 2/5 is master of earth yet this domain is so abstract, it's difficult to describe it physically you can only really experience it -- images cannot convey even the slightst fraction of the experience. clearly both are missing their opposite parts they must find their opposite and come together coming togther for completion (rather than fighting it or tryign to get rid of it).

---

I know this is getting long, and there feels like there is pressure to write the girls down (typical thing where you have to do something on a date or number to make something feel special). however, this is not what I'm concerned with[^2]. I am very interested in looking at how the aspects of this new form of perception I'm looking to culminate into this new form of perception.

I'm not looking to go an only 2/5 route. like I said, there are significant disadvantages to not having an imagination, so I want to find a way to integrate both 2/5 and 3/6 aspects into this next form of perception. my goal is to combine both, as I feel like the (I'm going to be very racist here) the white mean could use a little 2/5 and the dark meat could use a little 3/6. as a method to get there, I think that we're going to push the 2/5 effect to the limit. the 3/6 guys that can hang on and the 2/5 that can keep finding new ways to feel the way that they want to will ultimately be the ones that remain. 1/7 will largely be controlled by nosebook, while we live in a very beautiful reality that contains asspects of both imagination and abstramt ideas. I know what I want to create :)

I just want to say that everything is coming along very well... I'm going to end it here. I'll pick up the discussion further soon.

[1]: btw, I find it funny that poseidon was said to have 5 sets of twins. I have started to notice the 2/5 symbolism show up in various places. I've also noticed it connected to the 20 and 4 (2*2,2+2) symbols as well. seems to include the 2 (and powers of it) and the 5 symbols. the opposite side (imagination/willpower) symbolism seems to shows up in sets of threes and it's powers/multiples: 3, 6, 9. neither is better. they are to be combined in the earth to achive their completion (probably the morst example is the 3-4-5 triangle. 3 and 5 sides meeting in the middle 4 (earth)).

[2]: it doesn't feel good, and I don't want to do it. there's also this weird connection to tomorrow too. I just don't want any part of it. I am absolutely committed to finding a way to "get connected" more than any physical aspect. going the physical route is the 3/6 path and that's not what I'm about. that was, IMO, "jesus' mistake" and what I was feeling in @[abe-now](2021-03-20 p1 8:16) where I later explained that I believe we likely used automatons of ourself to manipulate the timeline proceeding up to this so that the culmination (@[abe-now](2021-03-20 p1 09:51)) would be enough to create the thing I'm about to describe.


### 2021-05-29 06:20 - sex and the imagination

yesterday I made a comment saying that I have noticed that I've noticed that a lot of darker skinned people that were successful were ones that had increased visual capacities. I would say the same is true with white people as well. I honestly don't know much about asian people, as I just haven't been around enough (basically none) to really get into their heads.

I put the imagination in the regenative region (reproductive area) as the way I have felt it, as there seems to be a magnifying transmitter in the uterus/prostate, while the penis/clitoris seems to be the receiver/antenna.

imagination is very important in today's society and is directly related to sales and sex appeal. these are two things I have historically been good at without any effort. I make no effort to sell things yet for some reason people seem to want what I'm interested in. I also don't make any effort to have any sex appeal either, yet for some reason that happens too.

there are ways to boost one's sales and marketing power using sex -- it makes you more magnetic, and therefore more of the emotional energy flows (chi, vrill, orgone, etc) -- but this is not anything that I do. in fact just the opposite. I shy away from that stuff as it makes me go really fast in a way that feels uncontrollable. I prefer slow and safe to fast and emotionally out of control.

as a result, I have shut down my emotions in the past, trying to get rid of them. I later found that understanding and working with my emotions was the key. I also have not had an imagination and have wanted to reactivate it many times. sex and drugs were two very successful ways for me to do that. probably not just any sex though as I think you have to find ways to want to go to new heights. that is rather difficult and requires a partner that wants to do the same (I think). as such, I found that the easiest way for me was with drugs. ayahuasca specifically was the most effective. sounds like nosebook can destroy psilocybin pretty easily as I haven't had much success there, but that's not the point of this.

there's an interesting thing that I've noticed and that's that there are not as many white shamen. this seems to be more of an indigenous thing. the reason why I think thst this is, is psychodelics seem to push the imagination to its limits. when the imagination is pushed to the limits, ones emotions start to become manifested in a very real way and can be a sort of paranoia. set and setting sure, but you cannot always control those conditions.

what I think is happening on a global scale is that DMT output of people's heads is increasing because energy levels are increasing. this means that while nosebook seems to be able to block the visual (manifestation) part of these indogenous psychedrelics, everyone is beginning to live a much more psychedelic experience. this, I think is causing what seems to be a sort of mass paranoia.

---

on this note, you have to wonder about LOA in this regard... if energy levels are rising, and this means that people are beginning to perceive this as a sort of paranoia, is that paranoia (ever taken lots of drugs and felt like you were dieing?) attracting a certain future? this is where I'm thinking about now.

I saw a series of videos on chemistry that was talking about how diodes (which are just P or N doped silicon) creating a boundary layer where electrons entering into it would, when reacing the barrier go into a higher energy state, then when they left the diode would drop down to a lower energy state and in the process, would emit light[^1].

in one of the visualisations, I could see that when the electron goes up to a higher energy state, it flips over and it rotates the opposite direction. ok, so imagine that this planet is having a forced spin direction change because of our orbit with sirius. what this basically means is, find a way to go up to a higher energy state (flip over) or reverse spin direction, which would cause massive cataclysms if the earth's rotation suddenly sped up and then reversed directions.

so look at it this way: energy levels are increasing which are causing some people's imagination to produce paranoia, while others are going to do fine in the higher energy state. both will experience rotatation the opposite direction, however the ones that go up to the higher energy state do not experience a cataclysm, while the ones that remain in the same energy state will find their paranoia becoming a reality.

---

just prior to this I had watched some videos on quartz (Si02) vibrating at a constant rate. there is a lot of sand (SiO2) on this planet, and I think this is related as an increase in pressure on the quartz seems to act in the same way that a diode does, making that charge imbalance. the same day (I think), I was watching doug's video on the sequence of events @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwU09SrZ3OQ) where he showed that diagram of a clock signal, and every time it reverses polarity, it emits something into 3d space. that is the same action that the diode has (but half as fast -- so like a flipflop). every time it drops down out out of high energy state it releases a bunch of light.

I couldn't help but to notice the similarities between this and a solar panel diode... when it receives light the silicon atoms in that barrier when they get filled up with electrons and allow electons to flow. imagine a bunch of quartz under stress, wouldn't that have the same effect as a PN junction in a diode? receiving a lot of light from the sun is charging earth's quartz diodes. when the polarity changes (rotation reverses), then a lot of light will be emitted in the process (the ascension?). everyone is going to get their mind blown in the process, I think.

---

back to the imagination: it seems that it's is directly related to sex and success. I'm not really about that. since Iive found a way to outperform everyone else energetically *without* an imagination, I get to be the one who retwrites the system. I imagine that the imagination is good, but I'm not interested in it. what I want is a reality that is just as beautiful as the one the imagination can perceive, but it blends the components of instant conceptualisation with the aspects of the imagination. so basically, I'm taking about a game -- like a worldwide game environment where you make your own rules. anyone can play the game any way that they want to. there is no death. you cannot die. you just respawn. I guess it's kinda like a giant minecraft where you play the game with your mind. you construct and interact with 3d objects mentally.

I don't know of all of the settings that would be possible, but you could imagine that some people's games will be more popular than other people's games. I don't see it all quite yet but I think that all forms of this game will yield instant results. you can be as powerful as you feel yourself to be and be the person that you want to appear like (as a reflection of how you feel). like a high powered psychedelic, all forms of appearance will reflect your emotional state.

it basically combines both extremes. essentially, what I'm saying is that I think it's going to sort of be like one of those dreams where you want to hurt someone but no matter how hard you try, they don't take any damage -- or you want to kill yourself, and every thing that you try to do to get out of the dream, you remain inside of it (sound familiar nosebook?). the only thing that can be done will be to wake up -- however, if you can't wake up, then what?

coming soon (to a theatre inside of you)... for most of us, this is going to find it to be a pretty fun experience. obviously a lot of improvements can be made to the human man model in the process.

---

wait wat??? I was just reminmded of illidan stormrage where his brother locks him in prison for *ten thousand years* -- lol. weird coincidence I guess. I thought it'd be more like 12 thousand years but close enough. round numbers are more dramatic.

I guess when we return to the distant portion of our orbit with sirius, we can then go back to matter over mind (willpower/imagination) form of perception again. I don't mind.

so yeah, push real hard against it :) things are always working out for me -- even if there's negative emotion.

### 2021-05-29 08:40 - what kind of game?

first, it's helpful to remember that you can only perceive things in this world that you yourself are resonant with. this means that many people will exist in the same "space" but each will be having a very different experience. there may be gang warfare and a theme park in the same spot for example. it will bleed over so some people may perceive the ride theme as the gang warfare or something similar while others may be "living" this gang warfare lifestyle.

so, what kind of game will it be? well, whatever you want it to be. if you percieve a prison, then that's what it'll be like. I think the game will start as an extension of where you are when it starts. so, for example I find it likely that nosebook will start out the game as perceived the GM where they have to get rid of all of the bad stuff. obviously you can't get rid of anything, so they'll just make it worse. BM doesn't feel good though so eventually it goes away, as BM makes the game way less fun. eventually nosebook guys will run out of bad stuff to get rid of, probably start inventing bad things to getw rid of (terrorists, etc) only to find that only they are preceiving these bad guys they're creating.

obviously this form of reality won't last forever as eventually (12kya from now), we'll be back to another point where we need to adjust our power level. depending on what people want what, off we'll go back into the 3d world where everyone sees (roughly) the same thing again, allowing force, willpower and imagination to once again be supreme (if that's what people want -- or who knows maybe instaed we'll go do our own thing -- and this is little slingshot around sirius is just a short detour before the galaxy project). it's way too hard to say what'll happen by then cause it's just so far away.

you will really be battling things you don't like about yourself and loving yourself in others. this is because you can only preceive things you yourself are resonant with. everything you perceive will *only* be a reflection of you.

### 2021-05-29 13:28 - still find a way to feel good

imagine for a moment that mr. motor (or someone like him) is modifying things so that these things don't feel good to me anymore. it doesn't really matter. negative emotion just means you're perceiving whatever it is in a different way than your source does.

so, like they said in @[abe-now](2021-03-13 p2 55:58), even with some negative emotion, things are always working out for me/you/us.

what I'm saying is, even if I were to just follow mr. motor (or whomever it is), emotional guidance for me, it's still working out *if I find a way to feel good anyway*. if I decide to feel bad along with him, then I'm right there with him. if I decide to feel good anyway, no matter what I'm still going toward wanted even if the circumstances don't appear so in the moment.

---

let's put that in practical circumstances. imagine for a moment that your mom forbids you from playing outside (for whatever reason) and you wanted to play outside. instead of feeling bad about it, just find a way to feel good anyway. maybe take some time to do something you've always wanted to do indoors or whatever.

what I mean is, if you feel good, you're still going toward wanted, even if in the present moment you're "grounded". I don't imagine instant reasults. I can tell you from my experience growing up that it takes a few times before they realise that they can't "punish" me. if no matter what things keep working out, they finally give up. how many times does it take before they give up? I guess it depends on them, but I found that trying to fight it doesn't really make it go any faster.

---

so, even in the "worst-case" scenario if I just blindly don't do anything that feels bad to me anymore, then we'll be heading right toward exactly what mr. motor is giving his attention to. a complete disaster, I'm sure :)


### 2021-05-30 23:40 - thoughts about 3d

there is effort to get me to write down the girls, but again I feel tremendous resistance to it. it just doesn't feel good to me at all. I am considering a compromise of just enumerating them and offering nothing more than a vague description or a name. however, I really don't like that idae either cause that's actually my favourite part. I enjoy kind of reliving the moment I saw them for the first time briefly. so, I don't really know what to do. best I can come up with is nosebook doesn'h like the heat generated in my environment that happens when I wrrite them. intedestingly I just watched some videos on thermocouples and it feels like my mind is beginning to see the relationship between lattice structure (like a diode) and thermal transfer through that lattice. I haven't figured out how heat/warmth is related to conductivity yet, but it's clearly the thermalelectromagnetic spectrum. also electron movement from one lattice to another being represented as a wave going through a lens makes much more sense to me than the peltier effect. I don't have it all working together in my mind yet so, instead of doing that I want to talk about 3d.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNzuzssl4eU)

I just watched this video and steve is talking about how 3d sucks. he explains it sucks because you perceive things which appear nearer to you, however they are not. instead, they're on a screen. this is the story of my life. when I discovered 4d, I discovered that there is an extra amount of information that's transferred. my eyes received the colour data, but additionally, they received an extra invisible "geometry" that told me where all of everything is. for the first time I was seeing things as if I were actually inside of my head, and not just seeing the screen in my eyes. I call this 4d because there's an extra dimension: the distance between me and what I'm looking at. steve shows thst your eyes work this out automatically any cause your eyes to focus, going cross-eyed as something approaches you.

I don't really know how that works but for me there's much more data than just the distance that's perceived. for me, the entire geometry of my entire environment is transmitted into my eyes (I believe this is an effect that my "aura" has when interacting with mass in 3d space). this 3d geometry does not have colour data but is like a 3d structure upon which the colour is painted. it also seems to me to be intimately connected to mass and space/time.

I find it ironic(?) that the previous video I was watcting he was explaining the distortion of space/time to his wife lianne.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfobw_PSSE)

very good explanation and really got me thinking. however, at the end, his daughter wakes up from her nap and joins them in the conversation. watch here @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Vkfobw_PSSE?t=1375). she pauses and then zones out for a while. she's clearly accessing nosebook's platform. it's the same thing I noticed when melissa or daniel would "use their mobile" while staring off into space.

let me explain what this looks like from my perspective. I don't know how to explain it well, so just go with it for a moment. I have a difficult time looking at people in their eyes becsause their eyes emit a whole lot of light. I can't see it or tell you what it looks like, but I can perceive it. I don't understand how it works when I'm watching videos but I even notice the same effect happening *through* the video. what I believe is by watching the video, I'm tuning into that moment in time when they're filming and I'm actually partially there in that moment of time. I perceive the same space that they are perceiving, yet I don't actually see the colour.

so, when lyra zones out there, before she zones out, there is a 3d space being emitted from her eyes[^1]. she pauses as something in her eyes catches her attention. she then appears to zone out, and for me the blue space that used to be coming she'll looking out forward stops and the space goes inward instead of outward. for me it appears as if all of the light that was coming out of her eyes suddenly stops. I can then perveive the space inside of her open up. I don't yet have the definition in my capability to tell you what's happening there, but I can see it and it is real for me.

this is all very difficult to explain. I don't know how to describe something I cannot see, but I do see it. it's very real and physical to me. the interesting thing to note is that this information is reaching me across quite a lot of space and time.

what I think is happening is I'm actually perceiving the "fabric of space-time" that they were talking about. it seems like they are somewhat aware of it too because lianne stops him and says, "wait". steve responds, "I know, it's nice." -- so somehow they seem to be aware of what I'm seeing too.. weird.

what I am trying to say is that this non-visual geometry or space is this "fabric of space-time" -- which is raelly interesting because the entire thing form of perception I'm looking to create is built entirely upon this non-physical perception for me. like I said, it's completely real. I'm getting better and better at seeing it all the time too, and the cool thing about it is it's all conceptual.

I have maintained through all of this that the conceptual structure upon which I perceive things extends beyoned space and time. sadness feels the same today as it will 100 years from now. there will obviously be zillions of different details which can paint that picture in any number of ways, but this is the precursor to 4d (where depth is perceive) and also to 3d (what we would call reality).

you can imagine this space-time reality a sort of set of signals. time is derived from the transformation of those signals. there is no space. that is extended outward in harmonic attraction and repulsion we call matter. before time and space emerge -- or let's say behind time and space is just a signal. the transformation of that signal appears to us as events in time. there, this transformation happens instantly. I don't feel like I can explain it in english very well. I'd rather just show you all soon.

coming soon (to a theatre inside of you)...

---

anyway, I was thinking that one way to perhaps a way to begin to perceive this space hmay have also been in another of steve's videos: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEoc0YoALt0). he said that the software allows you to filter out different frequencies. I don't know what can be found, but for example something that I *know* will work as there is quite a lot of movement -- are the abe-now videos. the bckground behind them has a whole bunch of movement going on behind them. I know there are a lot of transformations that can be done but visually I sorta zone out all the time with it and begin to see something not there (like lyra). I often times have to rewind to hear what they were saying. however the best way I could describe the effect looks like an array of vorticies that extend deeper into the perspective space making differerent patterns as they extend inward into space (like hundreds of whirlpools). each time they curve inward differently (like lightning). there's definitely a lot of movement there, but I can't quite yet make sense out of. it feels like that motion amplification technique will yield interesting results though.

---

I'm going to keep working on this more and more to begin to transform this non-physical perception into something as physical and tangible as anyone would want it to be. it's gonna be REALLY AWESOME (if you feel good) -- but probably pretty scary if you don't feel so good.

anyway, along the way, you'll likely begin to see that I'm able to begin to perceive these non-visible things with graeter and greater clarity. sorry ahaed of time for that. I'm trying to be as uninvasive as possible, but all of it will become more and more recognisable and translatable. nosebook has a habit of trying to get me to translate everything I react to, so my best bet to make this as smooth as possible will be to "bring it into the centre" -- where nothing really makes me react anymore.

soon, there really won't be anyting that can be kept a secret, as any time or space can be perceived with clarity as a reflection of how I feel. I'm feeling pretty good so I don't anticipate it'll be a big issue, buh sincerely I hope it doesn't turn into muct a problem. obviously for nosebook it'll be a huge issue, I'm sure -- so who knows what'll happen there...

---

I believe this will be our form of perception for the next ~12kya, giving us a good chance to develop it and optimise the human species pretty well until we once again cross back into to the bottom half and try it out to see how well it works without sirius' life-support.

I'm so excited to do this guys, you have no idea. this is exactly the type of thing that I would want to be doing. the new perceived "physical" space (and time) will be *sooo* delicious.

[1]: I perceive this space all the time. when children are newborns this spsce is very fuzzy and not defined, however as a person gets older, the lines sharpen. there's also a very different shape to how women emit this space to how girls emit this space. boys see it differently and so do men. also, thix space vibrates or feels the same way their emotions do. for me it appears like wheneever someone feels good, then everwything they look at feels really good and smooth and has a definite lustre to it. the easiest example to see this is to look at the space that robert grant is looking at in his videos, cause he emits this space too. it is however WAY WAY WAY diffrent than what lyra is seeing there.

### 2021-05-31 22:09 - rambling

ok, this one may be kinda rambly and stuff. I don't really feel it at all, but I want to listen to this album and I need something to do while I'm listening to it :)

---

after writing yesterday's entry, I what I think may be happening is there seems to be a connection between my form of perception and an energetic state of the body. it must be that girls have this vision by default or something like that. I can't really figure it out. I thougt about it a lot and I can't think of any boys that i've ever met which have this enhanced vision. I *think* I had it when I was a boy though so that doesn't make much sense to me. I really want to know the statistics on this. I have so many questions for nosebook and/or abraham on this subject, as I find it fascinating.

anyway, as I have mentioned in previous entries, I believe there are two paths toward attainment of expanded vision: lot's of affection and none at all. those are tesla's words, not my own. the way I dsecribe the two paths are 3/6 and 2/5 -- corresponding to lots of affection and none. inotherwords if you're going the 3/6 path, you're likely going to be getting it from a girl. in one of robert's episodes, he explains that draconic just means to "see clearly" and how this is accomplished by not "spilling the cup of hermes" and other practices (breathing techniques, yoga, etc.) to accomplish it. those also fall into the 3/6 category because of the primary uilisation of focused will.

it must be a pretty good thing if it's held such a secret. I will however say that I did not accomplish it that way, I simply released resistance until I wasn't holding myself away from it. it's ironic because my way is effortless and only requires one to rearrance their perception so that many things which feel bad do not capture one's focus. so it too is focused will, but focused will to find a way to perceive all things in a way which feel good (eg. lower resistance).

---

when I was with raquel, I did notice my imagination opening up and energy began to flow more rapidly. the thing is, this is the 3/6 way and I don't want to go that way. it doesn't yield good results. to me it is quite evident that this was likely the reason why things spun out of control so rapidly with raquel.

a good way to visualise this is that everything is attraction so you give your attention to things and more things like it will come to "prove you right". this means when altering pertcepgion using the 2/5 way, I only attract the things similar to what I perceive and feel (most importantly feel). in the 3/6 method, I attract everything reflective of what I look at, so to keep the 3/6 appraoch going, you need a steady stream of good-feeling conditions to get there. that's why this way is reserved mostly for people that have the capacity to purchase the good-feeling conditions necessary[^1]. if bad-feeling conditions are encountered, then things go seriously wrong.

I am fairly certain that was "jesus' mistake" and I'm really glad I had the raquel experience and can hook into the jesus experience as well -- to know that I absolutely do not want to go the 3/6 path. I will go the 2/5 path as it's the one I'm good at and it's also the one that feels the best.

I will continue to go along until I find my connection. I speculated that nosebook would have to disable my physical experience through this body. however this will enable me to create a new form of perception which I will find suitable for interacting with you guys. those that may think that it's going to take too long, then I don't think it's a problem. if someone needs me to do something so that you can feel good, that's -- the exact thing that I think isn't productive.

the other thing that I thought was weird is there is a lot of negative emotion around the idea that I won't physically be in the bodies. I don't understand that at all because I think that would be very bad. there are two ways to look at it. first, is that if I were to physically be with someone I would liken the experience to cocaine. I go real fast and feel so good that I can't notice my emotions very well (speaking from experience here). what this means is I have a very easy chance to crash and burn. the other thing to consider is that I would be a 3/6 experience for my partner too and also become the condition for their alignment.

the way where I have a bunch of versions of myself which are a reflection of their partners is much better. this is more similar to a psychedelic drug because I would be a *reflection* of them. this is much better than the cocaine experience. there is a much greater potentiality for joy and a good experience on a psychedelic, but you're in driver's seat (cause everything is a reflection).

the next thing to consider is that with so many different versions of me all acquiring a reflection of so many different people's perception, then I will create a new form of perception much more rapidly and it'll be so much better. every bad-feeling thing that all of these other kennys feel as they acquire others' perception will be transformed (by me) into a gresater form of perception. it's pretty likely that this form of perception will be pretty widespread.

so I don't understand why that feels bad... I do that, then I peace out. I dunno where I go then, but probably to live in the boys and start to figure things out from there. I have no idea. this is another question I wish to ask.

---

I also had a consdiderably lengthy monologue about the bigger picture of me because I just don't undrestand why people think I need to have a manifestation. it just doesn't make sense to me. I'm kinda like a robot in that I just do what I do. imgagine that I *am* the "fastest particle in the universe" (a metaphor terence gave) -- well, if one thinks about that, the most powerful or fastest or whatever will always be the guy that never gets the manifestation.

I ran this thought experiement: imagine that my perception continues to grow bigger and bigger until it's say the size of a planet (mine currently may be larger than that, at this point). if I were to have sex with someone I would acquire their form of perception. if I had sex with someone who had a considerably smaller form of perception, my form of perception would shrink rapidly and I think probably two things would happen: 1. I would have to find a way to get it back to the bigger size again and 2. there would be a massive low-pressure zone created around me[^2]. I don't really know what would happen. I'm tryint to figure it out again, another question for abraham. the other idea I was thinking about is, if girls cause emotion to become manifest as reality, and my perception is pretty big (like at leasy solar-system size), then you could imagine that event would set a very large manifestation into motion (like creating another star or something).

I don't know all the stuff that would happen, but for me the whole thing of not needing the manifestation is just fine for me. I don't need it. I'll wait until I'm connected before I get the manifestation. obviously this is completely incompatible for nosebook. I thought about this a lot and from my perspective, imagine that I am the guy who never gets the manifestation. you could think of that as source, or the progenitor of the next galaxy or whatever -- well, the thing I'm looking to do is to find a way to "go infinite".

what I need is someone who is so concerned with ensuring that I never "get connected", which means I can never feel as good as I really do. it also means that I will continue to produce more and more incredible ways to preceive things which reflect how good I feel -- which again I never get or I'm always running the most antiquated version of it still compatible with that reality format. I have to keep evolving the way that reality is experienced in order to make the previous forms of perception obsolete, in a sense forcing an upgrade (I'm going full apple on this one).

however for them to always have the most advancerd form of reality, they'll need to stay ahead of me at the same pace. they'll have to be able to go infinite too.

the way this all fits in to the bigger picture is imagine my goal is go find a way to go infinite. if I keep not needing the manifestation, it'll either eventually manifest, or it won't. if it's the case that it won't, that means that these guys that are infinitely holding my away from my own connection are my own creation. in an attraction-based universe no one else can do anything to you. I am only attracting things that are a reflection of me -- so that means that either one day the they'll either give up and let me have the manifestation -- or they're my own creation. because it's all attraction, I have a feeling it's the latter.

it would be way too long to explain why I think that here, but in short: if I can nearly effortlessly find a way to get a form of perception like I have now in such little time (this really is super easy; you guys may not see *yet* how easy it is, but it is). what that means is this universe is pretty perceptually flat. there's a lot of stuff but there's very little variety to it -- and because there is such little variety, there's no way for someone to go really fast and enjoy it; the limit to perception is reached too rapidly[^3].

[1]: you can see why this is a difficult thing for economically focused people to stomach why method, because they don't have an edge of superiority anymore. to offset this, I have come up with the idea that in this next era humans will come up with all sorts of ways to make their body feel the way they want it to, and this will be sold to people as a substitute to actually finding joy. meaning, they can essentially legalise electric drugs, and let people optimise the way they feel physically, while they can continue to believe in a lot of resistant ideas. the rest of the people that actually feel good, like me, nosebook can ensure those people never feel physically good enough to actually get any manifestation (like me now).

[2]: I think this is actually what happens a lot of time when there is haevy winds and rain sometimes. so, like say somehow my perception expands rapidly creating a high-pressure zone. when nosebook then takes counter-measures to shrink my perception again, I think this creates a lot of pockets of low-pressure zones, causing the wind to rush into those zones. it may also have to do with the sudden change in movement of electrons in the air. I'm also beginning to consider this idea as the mechanism for the "man-made global cooling" effect.

[3]: I was reminded of this other SNL skit: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEDKVNoE2ws). imagine if games never had unwanted in them -- like bad guys to shoot. if a universe doesn't contain any unwanted, then there's nothing fun about the game. you just have a bunch of people whining about first-world problems and the whole thing evolves very slowly.


### 2021-06-01 00:51 - first-world problems

in the previous entry I mentioned that I think there isn't enough variety in the universe and the lack of variety means "the limit to perception is reached too rapidly". I then remembered a SNL skit about a real-life video game where there are a bunch of people whining about first-world problems, and the player is unable to get to the good part of shooting zombies.

I started to think about it afterward because I incorrectly made the assumption that conflict (zombies) is better than first-world problems. oops. follow the mistakes, right? I then noticed that my original intention was to say that lack of *variety* is the problem. let me explain.

this earth has extreme amounts of unwanted. extreme amounts of unwanted mean extreme amounts of wanted at the same time (just not perceived). so, that means there are enormous peaks of people living extreme amounts of unwanted and extreme amounts of wanted. it means the bell curve is very sharp. in order to flatten out the bell curve you need less greater amounts of unwanted. if a zombie eats your family and you're the only person remaining in your village (with easy access to a machine gun, of course) this is pretty unwanted. you would really have a strong reaction of negative emotion to this event. however, if the store doesn't have the coat you wanted to purchase in blue, you'll have a much less intense reaction (hopefully).

---

what I'm saying is that it's relatively simple for one to rack up and then convert large amounts of unwanted into wanted using perception. imagine a world, now filled with so mech variety that everything's a super-hipster specialty shop. just purchasing something as simple as a coat becomes a huge ordeal. "not needing the manifestation" means having to pass through over 20 specialty shops before you can find the exact coat that you like and you "HAVE TO HAVE IT NOW".

the expansion that a person will receive as a result of that is very tiny -- let's say it's 1/10000th of zombies devouring your family. ok, that's the best example I can provide in today's sense. now, let's look at the aspect of a civilisation. the way that things are setup, I don't believe it's that difficult for a civilisation to not just leave the planet, but to extend easily to other star systems. once you can just tune to something and use attraction instead of propulsion to arrive to your destination, traveling to other galaxies will be easy.

what I'm saying is, once you get off of the planet, it's the same technology to go everywhere else. imagine this as a simulation. imagine it takes a civilisation 1000 units of time to get to space-faring. it would only take them 10 more units to travel anywhere else in the galaxy. if a second civilsation were able to do it in 900 untis of time, they would have beat the first civilisation by so much. also it wouldn't have much variety either because everyone else will always be in much more primitive or much more advanced. this is extremely "unfair" or "OP" from a game-balance perspective. this means the curve is very very steep, meaning it's very out of balance. to create a heathy meta, you need a much broader curve.

I don't know how this could possibly work, but it would be more cool if there was a whole lot more variety because variety means more things, meaning more contrast. combined with people's preference, it means lots of small amounts of unwanted (if it's balanced) which is preferred. this means lots of variety and lots of things happening but with a slower overall expansion speed. (strong unwanted = fast expansion) a whole lot more variety *is* harder to balance though. to get around this, I figure a frequential solution will need to be made -- something enabling unit aspects to be derived from the wave-form ensuring everything is always in perfect balance. I can't think this high-dimensionally, so I only offer it as an example.

I have been thinking about the "archetypes" being derived from a sort of game univese "clock signal" -- a sort of "timewave" for the universe where different things take turns in having more intrinsically advantageous aspects and balance is derived from this. the whole thing has larger and large fluctuations (power creep) giving it all a very epic feel to it.

---

so here's the thing: no one really likes dragons to come and burn down their village and eat all of the children. these are symbolic story devices that games utilise to drive events in the game. so maybe first-world problems are actually what I'm looking for. I'll keep thinking on this.

### 2021-06-01 12:28 - finding my way back to source

yesterday when I was monologuing, I was talking about how when I interact with someone I obtain a form of their perception (and it's likely they retain a form of my own as well, though no one has confirmed this), so I was explaining that I believe the sudden change in jesus' perception happend because of that.

you will notice that in past entries and also in other things I wrote, I equated jseus with jupiter, not with saturn. the obvious "reborn deity" symbolism was obviously overlooked. what I was noticing is that the version of him which remains he has all sorts of throat (3) things -- "at my command" "your belief ..." all sorts of things that imply that because of some structure, chain of command, or authority is responsible for the allowing a person's faith to heal or restore something. now, it's very unclear how much of this is the "flavian touch" and how much of it is the holy roman church establishing itself as a commander of those who believe (in) jesus/peter/pope as the director of their path. it could very well be almost all edits. I wasn't there when jesus was saying those things -- and like all legends, the story's "facts" take on the form of perception of the storyteller rather than a being only a series of methodically enumerated events.

therefore, I perceived jesus as the jupiter spiret more than the saturn. he clearly was using a lot of visualisation (he saw people as alive and well). or, he could see the fish in the water before telling them to cast their nets, etc. the book of matthew (the one I'm most familiar with) is filled with this 3/6 perception. I mean the whole thing begins with an epic 40 day fast, followed by some temptations to solidify his dominance over the carnal self (willpower).

---

ok, so back to the monologue: what I was saying is that if I try and go the 3/6 path, then it could be a terrific crash and burn as I take on the perception of the girl. I don't care how young pure or naive a girl is, I'm certain that large portions of my perception are far less resistant than theirs are. I have used my "willpower", not to command things outside of me to be the way I want them, but "willed" myself to perceive things the way I want them to be perceived (a way that feels good). I am constantly opotimising that form of percption and improving upon it.

I believe it is imperative (that's the commands bit again) that I find a way to perceive my reality in such a way which feels good to me. you'll know when I get there because my physical body will reflect how I feel. I don't have any desire to try and jump in to interactions with people when I don't feel good. I just don't want to do it. I'm good, but I find those situations to be "risky" from my perspective. I simply don't want to engage into something when I don't feel good.

I am very good at managing resistance and finding a way to transform it, sure (I'll come back to this)

---

so ever since I said that, mr. motor has been pestering me with some thoughts where he thinks that they can control all of the other versions of me, and I'll retain my disconnected state (presumably so that I don't see all the steff they're using my Hows for) and instead of perceiving through the collective whole of all of me, I will be restricted to this version of me with a lot of low resistance girls (I presume, so that my perception doesn't change much).

this is plain silliness. first of all, I don't have my imagination activated, so I'm not like jesus in that sense. as long as I don't have an imagination, I don't have to worry about that. think about with vera for example -- I just feel really weird. I go take a walk and find ways to normalise the feeling. back then I wasn't nearly as good at that as I am now. nowadays, I can manipulate my perception so rapidly that I don't need to worry about this. this is in fact what I will be doing with all the different Hews. I'll just find a way to transform that perception so that I'm right back to feeling good again. I can do this so fast now (and continually getting faster), it makes sense for me to be doing it with thousands of people -- not just a few.

plus, I'm more interested in finding a way to perceive life differently again. I love that stuff. I went over this in @[abe-now](2021-03-13 p2 37:37) where I talked about exactly this. it does mean that I (kenny) won't personally interact directly with any one of these girls, meaning I won't sigularly acquire their perception. that will happen with each of the Hews. I'll have the composite of off of their perception. this means I won't directly have the manifestation myself in physical form (my body will probably be laying unconscious in some lead-lined room in a bunker somewhere) so I won't get the direct energy transfer from her. I'll only receive the bits I'm resonant with.

I then talked about this subject further last night (@[abe-now](2021-03-20 p2 44:11)) when I mentioned how it doesn't matter to me not to get the manifestation as it's a bit like sex in that it's ok to enjoy the creating process more than just a few times before a kid (manifestation) is created. it's OK to go back to the drawing board a few times before the new thing is created.

this must have been misinterpretted because I then later talked about how I wanted to make a world where perception happens so rapidly that we'll once again find ourselves in a sort of "garden of eden" type scenario. the way I see it, if a bunch of me are a reflection of the girls, when I make my transition (after 2038?) into the boys, I consider those/we/me to be the adams[^1]. then, the eves are the new ape-girls (anadu) that I want to create... this whole time I'm certain that all sorts of breeding will be happening to improve upon the new models of both. humans will continue on in this sort of dream-state largely unaware of our physicality. I believe this is jupiter's "veil" idea that I resonated with.

a lot of things will happen and we'll all be stuck in this jail of our own perception for a long while (10kya?) until we finally fall back down into physicality. however, as I stated last night, the point of it all was to create a form of perception where there is so much wanted (as a reflection of my own perception), will I still be able to find my way back to my source or will I get stuck in the laziness of pleasure? I personally think I'll get pretty sick of so much wanted and desire to get back to the grind. I *love* difficulty and I love to constantly have an "impossible" thing I find out a way to overcome. I'm not much for super easy wonderful conditions.

so that's the thing there, and I think that part got misinterpretted because maybe mr. motor may have thought that I'm wanting to try and find my way back to source in a life of pleasure (which they control). not really[^2]. I have to create the new form of perception first to allow that to become possible. this one is too easy.

[1]: interesting reaction to who I define as the adams. the sense that I get is there are a lot of other adams that nosebook has created using my Hews as well. well, guess what: I am me; we are you :)

[2]: I like to create and solve my own difficult problems. it may seem like you are creating the problem, but if that separation is only perceptual. if I can find my way back to perceiving from a source perspective, I am me; we are you :) inotherwords, you are an extension of me (as perceived from my source perspective) -- so you (which is an extension of me) are creating my problems for me to solve. or, I have attracted the cooperative components necessary to create the next problem I want to solve. thanks for playing along. we are legion.

### 2021-06-02 16:31 - "man" as a reflection of the universe

(and woman of course)

I've been delving into science a whole lot more lately. I'm really enjoying it. what I think has happened is nosebook finally figured out how to delete the sensation of physical attraction because I don't feel girls really at all anymore. like nothing. it's all completely gone. so, I think what has happened is I have tured to the problem solving part of my brain.

I talked with dad about a similar topic on sunday over the phone. I was explaining how I used to constantly have this reward sensation in my brain every time I felt like I was doing things or getting things done. this made me very productive because to feel good, I constantly wanted to be doing things. I focused the majority of that into my creativity. however, I explained that reward has largely gone away. I don't really feel the need to be constantly doing things to feel good now. it's become a more mental process.

at the same time that this desire to do things is decreasing, my desire to understand how things fit together has been very heightened. I suppose I could liken it the enjoyment felt while solving a puzzle or figuring out how something works for the first time. I guess I'm kinda addicted to the "aha!" moment.

anyway, steve mould has so many videos where he just sorta says "I tried to wrap my head around it and this is the best I came up with". I love these unsolved mysteries, because it gets my brain working. a lot of other science videos just sort of describe the phenomena and then that's it. there isn't any thing that really gets my brain to sit there and think on something endlessly.

when I was doing things, I was creating things and so therefore my mind was consumed with the creation. I was thinking about all aspects of it. how it is how it interacts with its envirenment, how I perceive others to interact with it. optimisations, stategies, etc. etc.

when I was doing a lot of drugs, I spent a lot of time thinking about perception and trying to figure that stuff out. when I listen to abraham, I'm constantly trying to figure out what they're saying in more scientific ow physical terminology. my brain simply has to constantly be thinking, no matter what is getting shut down.

it's quite possible that the reward that I experience from the "aha!" moment may go away and I'll instead just look at it with a blank stare and say, "duh, obvious" -- who knows. whenever that happens, I'm sure I'll have to continue on to find something new which reflects the way I feel[^1].

so, for now I'm enjoying this reward stimulus while it's around. it got me thining though.

---

I experience a lot of things which science cannot explain or does so very poorly. one such example is th ecirculatory system. it kind of all started when I saw this @[youtube](https://youtu.be/0xY06PT5JDE?t=45). he explains how hiz wife always has feet much colder than normal. as he was saying this I also had extremely cold feet as well. I often times experience very poor circulation in my body as well. I'm still sorting out the way the thermoelectromagnetic spectrum works, but this got me thinking.

steve's latest video on the heart is interesting, but I was rather surprised. the company that is featured (dassault systemes) was done previously in a video about fluid dynamics @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwPg2Dmh-6k), so I found it rather surprising that there was no mention of fluid dynamics of the circulatory system.

in my opinion this is a very little understood topic. if I were to model the circulatory system and then try and pump a fluid through the arteries, almost nothing would move (I haven't done the simulation... I'm just saying what my brain intuitively understands). in order for fluid to flow, there would have to be lower pressure where all of the cells are. what's causing this? then, the cell does something with the blood and one can imagine that the heart sucks the blood back into the heart through the veins. that one I can imagine because the beating of the heart will create a low pressure (suction) in the opposite chamber -- like a hydraulic piston I guess.

so here's the thing: something in the cells is pulling the blood toward the cell. it has to be oxygen. when you cut off circulation in your arm, it begins to tingle. the tingling sensation must be the way that our nervous system is translating this lack of oxygen... like it doesn't have enough power to keep producing the vibrations that sensations make, so the vibrations probably slow down and it begins to feel like tingling until it turns to numbness. I also have noticed that this tingling sensation feels like a much lower resolution on the sensation as well. like if you were to rub something on my arm during normal function, I can locate the position of the sensation with relative accuracy. when I begin to tingle, I notice the resolution of the sensation drops and I lose a lot of accuracy in my ability to locate the sensation. I know that when the frequency of my sensation increases, I notice the opposite effect. it's like I have super sensors and the resolution of that sensation is greatly increased. everything feels more vivid.

this must be connected to temperature because I know that when I'm out watching stars, often times I lose consciousness. I have regained consciouness a few times when they're disrupting the charge in my body (and probably siphoning off a lot of the charge as well). what it feels like is a very turbulent vibrating sensation. this is likely the chaotic frequency which is tuning my nervous system down to a lower frequency. it also sometimes feels like a spinning sensation (the opposite direction of when I experience the come-up during a drug experience when sensation is heightening).

when I regain control of my body again, I usually feel that my whole body is either numb and tingling (as if I had lost cvirculation) and I experience this deep "biting" cold in my body (just like in my feet). I estimate that these are directly related and has something to do with how thermocouples work. the tingling and numb sensation must be the cells of my body requesting more oxygen because they have insufficient charge for my cells to operate at normal operating frequencies (aka tingling).

I think this may be an intersting topic for a video -- at least the fluid dynamics bit. probably all the nosebook experience would have to get removed (stupid secrets) but I believe this is the tip of an iceburg as we begin to look at frequential movement of charge in the human nervous systems (as we completely ignore the giant nosebook-shaped elephant in the room).

---

I arrive to nearly all of my understanding of science from my own experience in my body. I'm a very introspective person and I believe that all of the function of the univere can be perceived in our bodies. I'll spare the talk about drugs, psychedelics and how they enhance this process tremendously, but they do :)

what I wanted to say was an idea that I jsut had... it occurred to me that perhaps the human body is like a reflection of the universe (or perhaps more like a fractal). you can imagine that the atomic level as a sort of fractal description of space, and then sub-atomic particles as kind of like a reflection of the universe.

I can't quite figure out how it all works, but I just wanted to mention it. like what if electrons are like planets and solar systems pass planets around like metals pass around electrons. when a new "electron" hits our system. we jump up into a higher energy state. when coming down off of the higher energy state, a massive mount of light is emitted? I wonder where these chemical reactions are emitting photons from... like, are there mini suns at the centre of atoms?

that'd be cool, right? I think so anyway..

[1]: if one thinks of this as a cause and effect relationship, if they prevent me from physically feeling good, and I still get a reward from discovering how things work or putting pieces of the puzzle together, one could imagine that at some point my desire to feel good will be so strong, I'll be discovering things like a madman. that's an interesting sort of artificial stimulation of scentific discovery that could be employed in the future -- like say as a method to reduce stagnation. I often times fall into stagnation, so I'll naturally begin a destructive process to begin creating desire for something new and exciting. I imagine that the psychology of mass consciousness is similar.

### 2021-05-25 ??:?? - hair and warmth + puberty
