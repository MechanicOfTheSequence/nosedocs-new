### 2021-05-25 10:06 - strings of time

a long time ago I wanted to see how reality (the temporal part of it) worked. I figured out that I could ask anything when I was stoned on mushrooms and get the answer. I perceived the deliverers of that answer as these gnomes that I called "reality technicians". they showed me that reality was like a string (or sequence) with inflection points perhaps these inflection points can be perceived like folds in DNA -- however we'll look at it in this example as a straight string with inflection points at the frets.

imagine that you are attracting something and there are infinite ways which the inflection point can be reached. the distance between the string and the inflection point is determined by your belief and the present circumstances of reality -- I call the location of these points the "structure" or "the grid" in abe-speak. this manifestation will happen at the inflection point and along the way to that inflection point there is a sequence which must occur for you to be "ready" for that point.

---

the way this applies is I have been thinking about @[noseblog](2021-05-22 23:46) and also @[abe-now](2021-03-13 p2 55:58). things are always working out for me. imagine for a moment that nosebook has a form of perception that is similar to the one that I will be acquiring here soon. what it means is they can put inflection points in their own perception which will accomplish what they are desiring based on how it feels.

they won't perceive the inflection point in physical -- it's a sort of feeling. it appears rather physical I'm sure, as I'm realising that my experience will be quite "physical" without much of the physicality (more on that later). what they'll see is the accomplishement of what they want as a perception conveyed as feeling.

let's give an example: let's say they don't want me to be talking about a subject, so they want me to be doing something else. they essentially feel me doing something else, and so being pretty non-resistant, I do that -- however, the feeling of whatever the previous subject it was was still quite active and so often times a harmonic of that thing manifests in the new action. the feeling remined the same but the action changed.

a good example of this was the other night. I was thinking about something that had to do with people getting stuck into my reality (the next sebject of this entry) and the nightbours started to make a bunch of sound. I went out and wanted to listen to the song. it was "hotel california". when she sang the lyrics:

```
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"
```

it was very strange because I started to perceive the "hotel" as the reality that I'm creating, and "california" was the nickname they gave me in la vera. I had the sensation that people were realising that they are all prisoners in my reality, by their own choosing.

I had been thinking about this for quite some time what that means because I also said something similar to this a few days ago (can't find the quote though) where I could see that I would essentially become the reality through which the rest of the world perceives. this morning I figured it out how that may happen. it goes like this...

---

when I lose my ability to perceive reality physicall, I'll begin to make reality more and more tangible for myself. like I've said, in dreams, I don't "see" reality like others do. instead, I perceive it and it's pretty real for me. there are a lot of physical aspects to it and stuff. every time I go there I seem to be able to "see" more and more.

so it's true that I won't be able to "see" things the way you guys do, but I'm fairly certain that the reality which I perceive will soon become superior to the physical one. what I mean is, I think that everything will be more beautiful, feel better and be much more captivating than physical reality. imagine that I can make an even more intoxicating reality than the physical one. girls can look even more stunning, more pleasure, more lust, more everything. I'm sure I can easily craft something like this. obviously you guys will be the ones that take it to the extremes but we have to get there.

along the way to getting there, I think normal physical reality will become quite intoxicating as it is. I have no idea what you guys version of physical reality looks like but it must be pretty mind-blowing to experience things that way.

anyway, I will accomplish that perception from my interaction with the girls. I'll see essentially an amalgamation of all of the different ways they perceive reality, as interpretted by me. some of what I see may rub off on them and they'll see it too -- not sure about that, but I'm fairly certain that we'll start to share this new form of perception where things look how they are not how they are presented to be.

you may say that is unfortunate that there won't be able to have illusions and deception in this form of reality -- but it'll be worth it by the way it looks.

I'll consider that the phase of creating a new form of perception that's even jucier than physical reality. it'll be pretty energetic though, so it may take a bit for some to acclamate to it. some people may not want to perceive others in such a tangible form. if they perceive things that don't feel good, they'll be really blown out of proportion -- like they'll look really ugly, nasty, and awful. they aren't really like that -- that's just your form of perception of them amplified to a million times what it would have been in the physical. likewise, if you see the person's wanted aspects, those will be amplified a million times and they'll look and feel a million times more desirable.

so, if you can perceive people the way you want to, then my form of perception will be superior in every way to the standard physical format. I don't know for sure, but I would imagine that the girls will acquire this form of perception the easiest. if they have sex with another guy, that form of perception will transform to be a mix of that guy's and hers (accentuated by the vibrations present in the moment of interaction). if she has sex with me again, I'll reap all the benefits of that because it'll be pretty simple to transform those ugly forms of perception into something wanted again. this will probably be the workflow of the second phase: the optimisation phase.

boys will be born I'm sure and I find it likely that at some point I'll make my transition from the many instances of kenny into the pysical format of the boys. I'll live and perceive through them. this is an important phase because of the binding procoss. let's talk really quickly about that.

---

for now this will only cover the male versions of me, so use your imagination for the female versions. the way that I believe the binding process will work is each instance of kenny will essentially be a blank slate. he'll have a very basic form of perception. from nosebook's perspective this won't be noticable because he'll have eyes and ears and they'll pick up the reality that is in front of him -- but, like me, he won't "see" what is there or "hear" the words you're saying. he'll mostly be telepathic and perceive things the way they really are -- so if you say, "I hate you" but are feeling love for him when you say it, the words mean nothing to him. he won't see physicality either. you could be a really beautiful person in real life but if you perceive yourself as a troll, he'll see you the way you perceive you.

once his "owner" has sex with him, he will acquire the perception of the owner. he will see her the way she sees herself and he'll see reality the way she sees it too. as a side anecdote, I thought it was very strange how much of the other person I acquired from them even with a minimal sexual interaction. with a lot of interaction I essentially become a mirror of the person[^1]. I was still quite resistant at the time, and even with so much resistance I became a masculine reflection of raquel[^2].

I believe this is the point, as the girls will become a reflection of me. they obviously don't lose their entire identity though, as I'm certain that it's kind of like a mixing. what I can see is there will be children I'm sure and the children will be, I believe a combination of me (XY) and her (XX), which means that the boys that are born will be kind of like a reflection of my form of perception, through the perception of their mother. I find this be a pretty good thing -- because when I make my transition into the boys, then I'll perceive that. obviously there will be further mixing and potentially more catastrophe as well -- like imagine they end up hooking up with some of the female versions of me which have been programmed by other men -- but those are future things.

anyway, I can see that there will be a continued number of transitions that these kids make as they learn to improve upon that perception as well.

I'm getting ahead of myself. simultaneously, I want to begin to work on a new set of females, which have been hybridised from the apes -- x4 models. I think it would be cool if we could find a way to create embroyo containing 2-4 girls x-chromosomes in the same being and see what happens, experimenting with different combinations of them. once we have a bunch of different models which are viable (I want many, not just one), then I think the future of this will be to have the boys (which is me after I make my transition) mating with these new females.

so, that means that there will be a bunch of boys which are a reflection of me perceived through the perception of their mother, which are going to mate with other girls which are combinations of the other girls' x-chromosomes.

I figure there will be some form of disaster (maybe there won't be, who knows) and the boys will acquire further improvment to their perception, but you can imagine that the form of perception that I'm going to begin to perceive through will become the basis for the new model of reality through which humans perceive. it certsinly won't be the last, I'm sure.

---

I wrote all of that out just to say that no matter what, this inflection point is likely on its way soon. nosebook can work their hardest to try and keep it away, but it's like a bezier curve: pull the control point away as far as you want and it just makes a sharper rise toward te inflection/destination point.

the new form of perceiving/interpreting reality will almost certainly be far far more intoxicating than this physical one is presently and people will actually *choose* this new form of reality because it's so much more fun, vivid, and "juicy" than the present one. it's not going to be worse; that I can assure you. I'm very excited to see how it starts to turn out.

[1]: the more I think about it, the more I'm beginning to believe this is actually what happened to jesus on the day befere his "triumphal entry". I believe he hooked up with mary on the night before to "celebrate" and that's when he started to see the world through her form of perception instead of his own. the next day he cursed the fig tree, "cleansed" the temple, etc. there was a dramatic change that happened there. I believe that a woman can be used to modify the control point of a timeline -- though not its destination point (if you simplistically perceive a timeline as a bezier curve). these inflection points seem to be more "set in stone" as physical points when things happen, very much like a fold in DNA (like where it crosses/branches to another sequence).

[2]: I believe this is also the case with other relationships I've had as well. I can definitely see how strong of an effect women have on me. I believe this same thing happens to young girls as well when they lose their virginity[^3]. they become a reflection of the person they had sex with.

[3]: or hasn't had sex in a while. I think the idea of virginity has to do with not having a strong signal. so, the same thing happens when you meditate as well. when you quiet your mind, you stop thought and reduce the signal strength allowing (by not destructively interfering with) your source.

### 2021-05-25 13:29 - a bit more on the binding process as it relates to evolution

I realised a mistake I wrote in the above entry which is that the Hew would take on entirely the form of perception of the person having sex with him/her. in fact, I'm going to chaange the name. instead of calling them a "Hew" (a name I got from skakespeare's sonnet 20) I will now just call them "mun". they can be either male or female, and are real (as in they have physicality) but like a moon, they are a reflection of me (the sun in this case). ok. now that's out of the way let's get back to it.

the way to see these "two witnesses" is a combination of male and female. like I said, I am male (XY) on the exterior and female (XX) on the interior. tesla will be female (XX) on the exterior and male (XY) on the interior. so he will be XXXY and I'm XYXX (or vicaversa) -- both x3s really, just opposite configurations. imagine now that I (XX) make a female mun... it'll be XX-XX (x4). imagine tesla (XY) makes a male mun. it'll be a XY-XY. (x2) so like an extremely feminine and extremely masculine at the same time[^1].

these muns will reflect their dominant vibration. so, when they interact with another strong source of vibration, the vibrations will mix. the ones that are similar will amplify and the ones that contradict will cancel each other out. the ones that do not interfere will be added. so all new novel freqencies will be added. rapid expansions in novelty (new frequencies into the signal) will become a part of the frequency of the mun. I those forms of perception will then reflect in reality. obviously the ugly stuff I will want to transform and the stuff that's very attractive I'll want to amplify further.

so what I mean by that is, mun will perceive the person as a reflection of mun's form of perception. if you believe yourself to be ugly, mun will see you as that way too, mixed with my (global) form of perception. so, like if I have already found a way to transform that ugliness into something not ugly (or even beautiful), then that's what mun will see -- not the ugliness. the owner may continue to see herself the way she sees herself, but she's more likely to see herself similar to how mun sees her.

now, imagine she has sex with another male. she will transfer my form of perception (as perceived by her) to him. again the vibrations are mixed (interfered with), so if she still has not transformed her own perception of things to a way which feel/look good, all of the stuff she has not transformed herself and he also still has a bad-feeling about, then it'll reactivate in her and it'll go right back to where it was.

what you can imagine from my perspective is, it doesn't matter to me if she does not want to change her perception. instead, every time that she brings it back, I transform it to the opposite, meaning it gets amplified[^3]. if she chooses to transform it herself, also it ges amplifed too cause we're amplifying similar forms of perception.

besids amplification, the other guy gets to expierience a form of my perception which feels really good. he can then choose to go back to feeling the way he wants to, or whatever but he did get to experience it. the other thing that is nice about this is, even if the guy has a very "negative" (bad-feeling) form of perception, then it does't matter to me. if it's novel, then it's something I want. I just take it and reverse it so it feels good. for me, the important part is to encounter as many novel forms of perception that I can, whether they arrive in negative form or not doesn't matter. what's important is the variety and diversity of forms of perception -- NOT how good they feel. making them feel good is my job. others can do it too, but I don't find it necessary.

---

clearly there are a lot of different configurations that are possible. some will want to just stick with me. others may want to have another guy involved that either wants to adopt parts of my perception and contibute new forms which I have not encountered.

I have more to say, but I'll end it here...

[1]: considering that I believe that tesla had taken over the world leaders with his automatons, they would be this type: XY internal and XY external -- so they would be ultra feminine but also extremely aggressive and internally conflicted as well. to understand this, imagine if you are a man that "you" are not one man, but two men in the same body. like imagine you and a little boy that always wants to play, dream, have fun and (I dunno -- be a boy -- I'm trying to imagine this perspective) sharing the same body as you. you would have to a strong "typical" male on the outside but on the inside you have weird fears like a little boy, etc. the opposite would be true for me in female form[^2]

[2]: if you're a female, imagine that you are not a woman in a body, but you're actually two women in the same body. one of them is like this obsessive hyper little girl with insatiable desire, while the external you is a full-grown woman that has to be a functional mother / part of society.

[3]: let's analyse a simple contrived example[^4] where the subject is, someone needs to behave differently so that they can feel good. I'll call this -1. my perspective is the opposite: no one needs to behave differently so I can feel good. I'll say this is +1. now, say her husband also has that vibration. she starts out with -1. when she has sex with me I will need to produce a +2 to cancel out the -1 and stay where I feel good. she now has +1. she has sex with her husband again and it cancels out her husband. he's at 0 now. he goes through life and something comes up his perception has remained the same so he goes right back to needing someone else to behave differently. he's back to -1. she interacts with me (or she transforms her own perception) so now she's at +1 again. when her husband interacts with her she's at +1 and he's at -1, so again he'll find himself at 0. however, if she has now produced her own form  of perception cause she wants to feel good, she now needs to produce a +2 to continue to stay at one. again her husband finds himself at 0. she goes to see me and she has +2 and I have +2 now also. so it make +4. again her husband decides te likes -1 better so he chooses that. she meets her husband again and she's at +4 now. she goes down to 3 and he goes up to 3. depending on him and how he sees things, this could stay around for a while and he may like not needing someone to be different for a while. however, if he chooses that he wants someone else to be different to feel good, then now he needs to produce -3 to get back to his usual form of perception. you can see how this continues to amplify. no matter the order of the events, each interaction will amplify if there is one person present that must feel the way they want to feel: >0 or <0 because of the compensation factor.

[4]: the example assumea 100% energy efficiency (it's not) so the numbers get real big really fast. imagine though, even with 10-20% efficiency, the numbers would still escalate rapidly.


### 2021-05-26 23:42 - needing others to do things so that I can feel good

yesterday, when I edited the commint message to, "I sounded way too presumptious there", I felt a lot of negative emotion. it felt as if some people thought that if I conceded and said that I was presumptious (instead of defending myself), that I was somehow -- I dunno, it felt like I was making things worse.

I've given it some thought and what I think is happening is there is the standard perspective that many women have, which is "you have to do (or agree with me on) these things, and if you do, then your life will be good, however if you don't you need to admit that you're wrong". those words may not be the exact sentiment, however the core of it is, "I want you to do something so that I can feel the way I want to"

it feels to me like a lot of men are against this. I'd like to break it into two parts here. first of all, was I being presumptious? well, as I said in @[noseblog](2021-05-22 23:46), if it happened in physical it *was attracted*. LOA is always accurate, and so for whatever raeson I appeared that way. it is perceptual, and so there's a lot of room for interpretation. it's often times the case that things appear (or even feel) differently than they are.

when things feel diffeerently than they are, this is an interesting problem because you would think that feelings are your "guidance system" and they are, however there can be a lot of noise. that emotional noise is often times your programming. addictions are the easiest example of this. just cause you feel like spending more time on facebook doesn't mean that is what what you really want to do. sometimes there's another programmed voice on top of it (like addiction recovery or some other mantra or affirmation), however below all of that is how you really feel. meditation helps connect to that voice. there are so many voices (culture, upbringing, friends, family) all telling you what to do, that it's often times difficult to sort it out what is really desired.

when it comes to appearance, it's also programmed[^1]. let's take an easy example of this. imagine you're out on the dating scene or hanging out in a pub or disco and want some affection. common sense states that if you're "too easy", then you don't value yourself very highly. you are there to just be taken advantage of. therefore, because of this value programming, now the other person must perform certain things to assuwe you that you are not "too easy", and therefore have value.

---

this is such a mind-blow for me and is the main reason why I abandoned the whole relationship situation completely. if you believe that people need to perform certain things so that you can feel valued, respected, trusted, etc. -- then you are doing the classic, "I need you to behave in a certain way so that I can feel ____". many people do not really realise how deeply woken into modern culture this idea is.

contrary to this, LOA takes the same idea and completely reverses it: I'll perceive myself as valuable and that will attract people who support that feeling. if I need someone to do something so that I feel valuable, then I have it backwards.

---

ok, back to the subject here. I will now separate this into two parts. the first one was: "did I attract a feeling of presumptiousness?" the answer is yes, and even if that falls into the catergory of programmed appearance, it doesn't matter. the point is, it's still perceived that way.

the second part here is, "do I need to feel bad for causing someone to feel presumptiousness?" the answer is always no. I am not responsible for how other people feel. ever. people can perceive any thing any way they want to.

the way I see it, you could try your absolute hardest to be the biggest douchbag ever, and if I perceive you doing anything to me, that's a fault in my own perception. I can only perceive things that I am also resonant with myself. no one can "do anything to me" (assert anything into my experience) which I am not already resonant with.

so, for me, this is not really a difficult thing. I always take the path of laest resistance.

---

there are some more reactions now. I'll let them settle a bit.

[1]: that is precisely what I'm going to be "rewriting" here in the this next phase, but that's not what I wanted to tslk about.

### 2021-05-27 01:02 - oops, I'm supposed to be a hypocrite, lol

I figured out what the reactions were about. they were about the second part. I was supposed to make women feel bad for making men feel bad when men don't do what they want. inotherwords, they want me to be a hypocrite. I'll try to play along here...

ok, it's not working... I just want to say, this punishment crap is stupid. there's no way I'm going to try and make them feel bad for making us feel bad. what on earth do you imagine that will create more of, lol. seriously...

it's just not necessary to try and make someone feel bad for something they did. ever. I'm done.

---

I'm beginning to get the hang of the way they try to manipulate me with their form of perception. they wanted me to present the idea through a different lens (see last night's thoughts for examples on that). then, when I wrote the above entry, I totally skipped over all the "important" stuff and just said I'm not responsible for how other people feel. the thing is, I'm becoming more and more source-like all the time, so there's less and less to fight against.

in someone wants to try and make someone else feel bad, then go right ahead. this is what I was talking about with the part on the douchbag. even if I made a full effort to try and make people I reject feel inferior and bad around me, while approving of others, I'm just going to get more people needing me to be or do certain things, then disapproving of me when I don't/can't fill their requirements, just so they can feel ____.

I'm reminded of the jersey shore show where there is so much needing of certain behaviour and status as a prerequisite for a feeling, it's such a complete mess. those guys must live in a constant state of dissatisfaction.

---

wait, last thing... people are wondering why I'm saying it's hypocritical behaviour... if I need you to not make me feel bad so that I can not feel bad... it's *still* needing someone to behave differently so I can feel a different way than I feel right now.

just, it appears more jusified because I need you to do "the right thing"
(so I can feel good)

lol...

### 2021-05-27 13:28 - balancing the 6 & 5 (part one)

I have been thinking about this one image I saw in the latest barcast here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/BZJcbtLZvOc?t=9304)

for me, it's all about "follow the mistakes" and I completely saw this one backwards. on the image there, he has 5 being the dark ages and 6 being the golden age with the mean of these being 23760 number. he then goes on to explain how this yogi "tera mata" (which sounds a lot like "earth mother" to me[^1]) calculates it to be aprox 23892.

that all seems good to me, but the part with the elipses I remembered opposite. for me there was a small elipse on top of 5 and on bottom there was a bigger elipse of size 6. that was the first weird thing, so just know that for the rest of this entry I'm going to be working off of my version (which is incorrect). I'll email alan after this to get his opinion, because for me, I always follow the mistake as there is often something to be discovered there.

I get why it shows the golden age being longer than the dark age -- and that's because it's the bigger ellipse. I also equate 6 with jupiter and 5 with saturn. ironically, there's this giant hexagon on saturn's north pole (but not the south). it's still weird though that I associate saturn with 5 though[^2]. again, for the rest of this entry I will ignore the hexagon on saturn's north pole and associate him with 5[^3].

---

to make this easier, I'll say that enki = 5 = time and anu = 6 = space. again, I'll use the definition of the ellipse in head which the larger ellipse is the one representative of space, while the skinnier ellipse is the faster moving part and represents time.

to undrestand the way I arrive to this idea, let us visit a discussion I had with mom around the subject of physical therapy. I do not believe physical therapy is necessary. for me this is getting the body (space) to do something so that I can feel (time) a certain way.

it is of my opinion that doing things with the body does do things to make me feel differently and can help, but the way that I feel is far more powerful and effective to make a change in my body. I see that both are good to have, but I believe this discussion is a sign of the polarity of these two ellipses swapping. in short we're beginning to processs the equinox at speeds faster than 24kya.

during this period of moving faster, time has more effect on space than space has on time. the period of reign of jupiter is the one where the body has more effect on the way someone feels -- like doing breathing exercises and stuff vs now, we're entering into the shorter but faster moving period where time (feelings) has a stronger effect.

this can be perceived as the rulership of anu (body) and the rulership of enki (time). to describe this, I'm going to jump into a bit of numbers, then I'll get back to more (spiritual) things.

---

anu is 6 and enki is 5. tiles the plane in the form of a hexagon. 5 does not tile the plane directly. a pentagon needs to be broken into bits (penrose tiles) for it to tile the plane. I hope I'm right on this, but those penrose tiles can be 2 types of four sided shapes (like @[youtube](https://youtu.be/48sCx-wBs34?t=526) or like @[youtube](https://youtu.be/48sCx-wBs34?t=836)).

when tiling 6, you can use the hexagon, but that's really just 6 equilateral triangles of the infinite number of triangle in the plane carefully selected so that they seem to all point to a common point (its centre). also 4 triangles can be selected to tile a triangle 3 times its size. so 3 and 6 relate to 4 in the number of times that you tile the triangle. 6 is just a superficial selection of those triangles. it must exclude other triangles on the plane to make these hexagons. tiling 5 relates to 4 spatially, in that the two tiles have 4 sides. I don't know of all of the penrose tiles possible, but I suspect there may be another sets of 2 containing a concave shape. this is something I've been wanting to study ever since I saw that video, btw..

anyway. my point is that when 3 tiles the plane, it can only be a subdivision of itself. so imagine the side length of the triangle being the planck length... from there you could make space work and all of space's subdivisions would be rational.

however, now imagine if the planck length was the side length of one of those penrose tiles. I don't have a maths proof for this, but it seems to me that if you could subdivide the penrose tile into more penrose tiles, any irrational number's position could be located. however, I know that no matter how hard you small you go, you cannot accomlpish the position of an irrational number with rational numbers. because the penrose plane infititely tiles, and no distance between any two points is an exact subdivision (maning, the tiles never repeat), then *any* irrational number could be positioned, given enough subdivisions of the plane. inotherwords, you could dubdivide the plane for as long as you wanted mor accuracy.

however because each of these subdivisions never perfectly contain its parent subdivision (cause they infinitely never repeat), then that means all subdivisions are relative to the parent division. in 5-space, everything is relative but irrational (sounds like emotions, hehe). in 6-space, everything is rational and perfectly subdivides the plane.

in part two, I want talk about how this relates to perception -- eg. mind over matter vs matter over mind.

[1]: crazy how ancient indo-europenan words sound so similar modern equivilants

[2]: just like frank discovered that earth's gometry was based on 7, it may be kind of a funny coincidence if jupiter's planetary geometry was based on 5. it would be an even weirder coincidence if saturn's south pole was found to be based on 5 while the north on 6, and jupiter's south to be based on 6, while it's north on 5... I don't know enough here to comment further.

[3]: an even crazier thing would be that jupiter (and so therefore venus as well) is based on 5, and is actually the planet which enki/ea is resonant with (making the planet we call the true saturn). that means all the records have been swapped and zeus is actually the planet saturn with all of the water ice in the rings. who knows...


### 2021-05-28 02:14 - my most audacious idea yet

I just got done watching the last episode of SNL for this season. one of the skits stayed with me though:

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdAEDif21l0)

in the skit, they're making fun of "God's" design of man. it's pretty terrible, no doubt. I was thinking about this and I don't see any reason why this couldn't be improved upon. I started to think about some improvements. this falls right into line with a topic I was thinking of writing called "hair and warmth + puberty". however, besides the obvious improvements, there could be more even past that. it then hit me: if I have power over my appearance, that means the DNA must match the appearance (obviously, if the cells are going to reproduce, right?) then that means that any male offspring will retain the y-chromosome of that version of me.

I figure that the appearance of me will largely reflect the way the woman I am bound to perceives me (as a reflection of herself) -- however, that doesn't mean that some large desirable improvements to the human man model can't be included. after all, it would be best to give them a an in-depth field analysis and make sure QA signs off on them too.

so I suppose this may sound a little crazy, but let's find out what's possible first :) the worst that can happen would be no major improvements? surely at least a few tiny ones will be accompliashed at the very least.


### 2021-05-28 22:09 - balancing the 6 & 5 (part one)

I can't remmebre where I said it -- and I think it was a random monologue, actually -- but, in it I was explaining that because there is no way they will ever let me do any creating with ordinary techniques like computer or whatever anymore that all of the things that I'm talking about regarding sales, product, and these sorts of things -- I'm not referring to any specific product or thing I will create in the future -- rather instead, I am referring to myself. this ideal "product" that I'm looking for is not some thing, but it is me.

I suppose you could say, "be the change you're looking to create" or "you teach through the clarity of your example" -- but more than just that I consider myself to be a "product" (or culmination) of a long series of events into something wanted.

I have talked about how I will eventually "become" the reality platform through which humans perceive, and I would like to talk a bit more about this. the easy way to perceive this is that I believe that in one part the elliptical orbit that we have with sirius, one half of the orbit is size 5 (we're moving faster and closer to sirius), and the other half of the orbit we're in size 6 where we're moving slower and further away from sirius. I haven't quite worked out which one is which neither emailed alan yet on it either, so just go with the base concept. there could be a duality to it as well, depending if you're looking from a mind over matter or matter over mind perspective. neither is worse and both have their advantages (as I will explain here)

---

it's quite fortuitous that I got to talk with melissa today. the reason is because I got to explain some things thsat were beneficial to me about how I perceive all reality as series of emotional interacttions between people -- extremely basic form of perception. I fell asleep afterwards and when I woke up I felt quite bad about a lot of things which I had talked about with melissa. obviously that's time for me to find a way to feel better about it. no problem. it's easy.

anyway, as I was thinking about that, I noticed that these different interactions between me and my world is very limited in that it's just me and right now only a handful of other people that I interact with. most of my interactions now are not physical and come to me in the form of reactions to things I've said or videos I've seen.

I mentioned to her what it's like to create in this new form of perception. I just feel it and it "manifests" very rapidly. I can't create objects in 3d space yet, but I have a lot of power over my interaction with others. I gave the example of let's say I want to say something funny to jaron. I just feel what it feels like to say something funny to jaron and the words just pop into my head. even I don't usually know what I"m going to say until it comes out of my mouth. when someone has a question, I feel the answer begin to form inside of me and then I jsut listen to myself tell you the answer. it's all completely effortless for me.

I gave further examples, but specifically on the subject of feeling what it's like to say something funny and then just opening my mouth when I could feel it, has been blocked by nosebook multiple times -- probably because it makes me feel good. what I mean is, after sleeping, I've tried to use the same feeling and I couldn't feel it. it's something like when I can feel a girl very strongly, then after sleeping, she's gone. I can't feel her until we find a new thing to feel in common about.

well, the same thing here. numerous times I've had the feeling of my humour blocked, but then found new ways to find a way to feel funny. it's quite easily actually. it seems to me like there are infinite ways to feel good about something. I don't need to find a stronger way to feel funny -- instaed, I just find a different way.

so here's the thing: I am one person interacting with jaron. I make jokes with mom but they fall flat often times. I wake jokes with greg too but they too often fall flat. it's not their fault, because I've lost so much resistance, I can now only really be something that someone expects me to be (eg. something they attract from me).

obviously the amount of interactions that are possible are very limited with such a small set of people. so imagine now that there are 100 of me interacting with thousands of others. this now has a tremendous benefit in that nosebook has to ensure that none of the other me's are able to just feel a certain way and let it manifest (to feel good). that means they have to block that feeling, meaning that again I need to find a new way to feel the way I want to feel.

this diversity is great, but ther's a super limiting factor here which is that it's just me. for this to really get out of hand quickly I have to find a way to mass-export this capability to other people. once people can find a way to feel the way they want those things will just manifest. nosebook then has the task of blocking that wanted feeling, meaning that those people, like me, will have to find a new way to feel the way that they want to.

this is going to blow diversity up really fast.

I was watching robert's latest video: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpuuRsa3O8o), and I was noticing something very diffrent when perceiving the latin-american people that were in the video as the guy was walking through the cities.

one of the most notable differences that I perveived is that white people seem to have much stronger imagination capabilities in comparison to indigenoous peoples. I also have also tried to pay attention to different black people that have become successful -- and what seems to set them apart is their visulisation capabilities. they seen to have more capability to imagine things and convey those stories/ideas in a captivating way.

when I think of latin culture, they are very interaction based. their minds are rather simple (like mine) in that it seems they don't perceive the details of the thing nearly as much as the interaction. I have to consider this idea from the perspctive of an ancient. for example, if I had to create art and things depicting various ideas that I have, how would I do that given the limited resources of stone, pigments, cloth, foodstuffs, etc. it would be very difficult. I could try and represent the idea in the form of symbols, but then there is a whole concept that is passed along with the symbols. if this is corrupted or lost, then the symbols appear random and meaningless.

as an example, bill cooper was talking in that video about this white dude (viracocha, quetzalcoatl) that came over to the americas and he brought this trinity symbolism. you have to understand that I've grown up in the church all my life so this isn't new to me. however, I always got caught up in the details of the symbolism of the father, son, and holy spirit.

as bill was reading manly p hall's book and I was in the latin-american frame of mind, this trinity finally made sense to me. this is what I have explained the whole time but from an acient perspective. you have who you really are -- your identity, your inner being or *your* source. this is the father. then that father extends itself into reality and gives birth to a son which is an extension of the father's identity. the holy spirit is source, the great cloud of witnsesses, consciousness, spirit ancestors, etc -- all the dead guys who have made their transition and are constantly attracting us toward further expansion of wanted. you are the son. you are trying to return back to the father. it doesn't matter how lavascious your lifestyle was, the father is always glad when you return to your source perspective.

obviously I use different words now to say the same thing and I take a much more programatic approach to the whole thing (using words like source, emotional/conceptual programs, etc.) it may alienate some people but programming was a very key part in understanding my emotions. there is a symbolic logic to their expression and they can be interpretted and represented as such.

---

ok, going back to the imagination: I was explaining to melissa that the advantage of the imagination is that you can perceive unwanted in it, allowing for graeter amounts of contrast, but you can seriously derail your initial inspiration after just a few iterations in the imagination. my method is much easier.

to understand this, one part of the oribit we have with sirius, the 2/5 part is in power. this is enki, viracocha, serpent, symbolism[^1], where as the other is 3/6 side of imagination and willpower. the world of the serpent is much mor basic and does not provide for as many details, as it's all based around relationships between concepts. in that world, details don't matter. you can describe it as a very high intensity psychedeic experience. at its higher levels, it becomes so abstract it starts to get difficult to describe it in a physical way.

I find it ironic that 3/6 is master of air (emotions) when imagination/willpower is very physical stuff, while the 2/5 is master of earth yet this domain is so abstract, it's difficult to describe it physically you can only really experience it -- images cannot convey even the slightst fraction of the experience. clearly both are missing their opposite parts they must find their opposite and come together coming togther for completion (rather than fighting it or tryign to get rid of it).

---

I know this is getting long, and there feels like there is pressure to write the girls down (typical thing where you have to do something on a date or number to make something feel special). however, this is not what I'm concerned with[^2]. I am very interested in looking at how the aspects of this new form of perception I'm looking to culminate into this new form of perception.

I'm not looking to go an only 2/5 route. like I said, there are significant disadvantages to not having an imagination, so I want to find a way to integrate both 2/5 and 3/6 aspects into this next form of perception. my goal is to combine both, as I feel like the (I'm going to be very racist here) the white mean could use a little 2/5 and the dark meat could use a little 3/6. as a method to get there, I think that we're going to push the 2/5 effect to the limit. the 3/6 guys that can hang on and the 2/5 that can keep finding new ways to feel the way that they want to will ultimately be the ones that remain. 1/7 will largely be controlled by nosebook, while we live in a very beautiful reality that contains asspects of both imagination and abstramt ideas. I know what I want to create :)

I just want to say that everything is coming along very well... I'm going to end it here. I'll pick up the discussion further soon.

[1]: btw, I find it funny that poseidon was said to have 5 sets of twins. I have started to notice the 2/5 symbolism show up in various places. I've also noticed it connected to the 20 and 4 (2*2,2+2) symbols as well. seems to include the 2 (and powers of it) and the 5 symbols. the opposite side (imagination/willpower) symbolism seems to shows up in sets of threes and it's powers/multiples: 3, 6, 9. neither is better. they are to be combined in the earth to achive their completion (probably the morst example is the 3-4-5 triangle. 3 and 5 sides meeting in the middle 4 (earth)).

[2]: it doesn't feel good, and I don't want to do it. there's also this weird connection to tomorrow too. I just don't want any part of it. I am absolutely committed to finding a way to "get connected" more than any physical aspect. going the physical route is the 3/6 path and that's not what I'm about. that was, IMO, "jesus' mistake" and what I was feeling in @[abe-now](2021-03-20 p1 8:16) where I later explained that I believe we likely used automatons of ourself to manipulate the timeline proceeding up to this so that the culmination (@[abe-now](2021-03-20 p1 09:51)) would be enough to create the thing I'm about to describe.


### 2021-05-29 06:20 - sex and the imagination

yesterday I made a comment saying that I have noticed that I've noticed that a lot of darker skinned people that were successful were ones that had increased visual capacities. I would say the same is true with white people as well. I honestly don't know much about asian people, as I just haven't been around enough (basically none) to really get into their heads.

I put the imagination in the regenative region (reproductive area) as the way I have felt it, as there seems to be a magnifying transmitter in the uterus/prostate, while the penis/clitoris seems to be the receiver/antenna.

imagination is very important in today's society and is directly related to sales and sex appeal. these are two things I have historically been good at without any effort. I make no effort to sell things yet for some reason people seem to want what I'm interested in. I also don't make any effort to have any sex appeal either, yet for some reason that happens too.

there are ways to boost one's sales and marketing power using sex -- it makes you more magnetic, and therefore more of the emotional energy flows (chi, vrill, orgone, etc) -- but this is not anything that I do. in fact just the opposite. I shy away from that stuff as it makes me go really fast in a way that feels uncontrollable. I prefer slow and safe to fast and emotionally out of control.

as a result, I have shut down my emotions in the past, trying to get rid of them. I later found that understanding and working with my emotions was the key. I also have not had an imagination and have wanted to reactivate it many times. sex and drugs were two very successful ways for me to do that. probably not just any sex though as I think you have to find ways to want to go to new heights. that is rather difficult and requires a partner that wants to do the same (I think). as such, I found that the easiest way for me was with drugs. ayahuasca specifically was the most effective. sounds like nosebook can destroy psilocybin pretty easily as I haven't had much success there, but that's not the point of this.

there's an interesting thing that I've noticed and that's that there are not as many white shamen. this seems to be more of an indigenous thing. the reason why I think thst this is, is psychodelics seem to push the imagination to its limits. when the imagination is pushed to the limits, ones emotions start to become manifested in a very real way and can be a sort of paranoia. set and setting sure, but you cannot always control those conditions.

what I think is happening on a global scale is that DMT output of people's heads is increasing because energy levels are increasing. this means that while nosebook seems to be able to block the visual (manifestation) part of these indogenous psychedrelics, everyone is beginning to live a much more psychedelic experience. this, I think is causing what seems to be a sort of mass paranoia.

---

on this note, you have to wonder about LOA in this regard... if energy levels are rising, and this means that people are beginning to perceive this as a sort of paranoia, is that paranoia (ever taken lots of drugs and felt like you were dieing?) attracting a certain future? this is where I'm thinking about now.

I saw a series of videos on chemistry that was talking about how diodes (which are just P or N doped silicon) creating a boundary layer where electrons entering into it would, when reacing the barrier go into a higher energy state, then when they left the diode would drop down to a lower energy state and in the process, would emit light[^1].

in one of the visualisations, I could see that when the electron goes up to a higher energy state, it flips over and it rotates the opposite direction. ok, so imagine that this planet is having a forced spin direction change because of our orbit with sirius. what this basically means is, find a way to go up to a higher energy state (flip over) or reverse spin direction, which would cause massive cataclysms if the earth's rotation suddenly sped up and then reversed directions.

so look at it this way: energy levels are increasing which are causing some people's imagination to produce paranoia, while others are going to do fine in the higher energy state. both will experience rotatation the opposite direction, however the ones that go up to the higher energy state do not experience a cataclysm, while the ones that remain in the same energy state will find their paranoia becoming a reality.

---

just prior to this I had watched some videos on quartz (Si02) vibrating at a constant rate. there is a lot of sand (SiO2) on this planet, and I think this is related as an increase in pressure on the quartz seems to act in the same way that a diode does, making that charge imbalance. the same day (I think), I was watching doug's video on the sequence of events @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwU09SrZ3OQ) where he showed that diagram of a clock signal, and every time it reverses polarity, it emits something into 3d space. that is the same action that the diode has (but half as fast -- so like a flipflop). every time it drops down out out of high energy state it releases a bunch of light.

I couldn't help but to notice the similarities between this and a solar panel diode... when it receives light the silicon atoms in that barrier when they get filled up with electrons and allow electons to flow. imagine a bunch of quartz under stress, wouldn't that have the same effect as a PN junction in a diode? receiving a lot of light from the sun is charging earth's quartz diodes. when the polarity changes (rotation reverses), then a lot of light will be emitted in the process (the ascension?). everyone is going to get their mind blown in the process, I think.

---

back to the imagination: it seems that it's is directly related to sex and success. I'm not really about that. since Iive found a way to outperform everyone else energetically *without* an imagination, I get to be the one who retwrites the system. I imagine that the imagination is good, but I'm not interested in it. what I want is a reality that is just as beautiful as the one the imagination can perceive, but it blends the components of instant conceptualisation with the aspects of the imagination. so basically, I'm taking about a game -- like a worldwide game environment where you make your own rules. anyone can play the game any way that they want to. there is no death. you cannot die. you just respawn. I guess it's kinda like a giant minecraft where you play the game with your mind. you construct and interact with 3d objects mentally.

I don't know of all of the settings that would be possible, but you could imagine that some people's games will be more popular than other people's games. I don't see it all quite yet but I think that all forms of this game will yield instant results. you can be as powerful as you feel yourself to be and be the person that you want to appear like (as a reflection of how you feel). like a high powered psychedelic, all forms of appearance will reflect your emotional state.

it basically combines both extremes. essentially, what I'm saying is that I think it's going to sort of be like one of those dreams where you want to hurt someone but no matter how hard you try, they don't take any damage -- or you want to kill yourself, and every thing that you try to do to get out of the dream, you remain inside of it (sound familiar nosebook?). the only thing that can be done will be to wake up -- however, if you can't wake up, then what?

coming soon (to a theatre inside of you)... for most of us, this is going to find it to be a pretty fun experience. obviously a lot of improvements can be made to the human man model in the process.

---

wait wat??? I was just reminmded of illidan stormrage where his brother locks him in prison for *ten thousand years* -- lol. weird coincidence I guess. I thought it'd be more like 12 thousand years but close enough. round numbers are more dramatic.

I guess when we return to the distant portion of our orbit with sirius, we can then go back to matter over mind (willpower/imagination) form of perception again. I don't mind.

so yeah, push real hard against it :) things are always working out for me -- even if there's negative emotion.

### 2021-05-29 08:40 - what kind of game?

first, it's helpful to remember that you can only perceive things in this world that you yourself are resonant with. this means that many people will exist in the same "space" but each will be having a very different experience. there may be gang warfare and a theme park in the same spot for example. it will bleed over so some people may perceive the ride theme as the gang warfare or something similar while others may be "living" this gang warfare lifestyle.

so, what kind of game will it be? well, whatever you want it to be. if you percieve a prison, then that's what it'll be like. I think the game will start as an extension of where you are when it starts. so, for example I find it likely that nosebook will start out the game as perceived the GM where they have to get rid of all of the bad stuff. obviously you can't get rid of anything, so they'll just make it worse. BM doesn't feel good though so eventually it goes away, as BM makes the game way less fun. eventually nosebook guys will run out of bad stuff to get rid of, probably start inventing bad things to getw rid of (terrorists, etc) only to find that only they are preceiving these bad guys they're creating.

obviously this form of reality won't last forever as eventually (12kya from now), we'll be back to another point where we need to adjust our power level. depending on what people want what, off we'll go back into the 3d world where everyone sees (roughly) the same thing again, allowing force, willpower and imagination to once again be supreme (if that's what people want -- or who knows maybe instaed we'll go do our own thing -- and this is little slingshot around sirius is just a short detour before the galaxy project). it's way too hard to say what'll happen by then cause it's just so far away.

you will really be battling things you don't like about yourself and loving yourself in others. this is because you can only preceive things you yourself are resonant with. everything you perceive will *only* be a reflection of you.
