### 2021-05-26 23:42 - needing others to do things so that I can feel good

yesterday, when I edited the commint message to, "I sounded way too presumptious there", I felt a lot of negative emotion. it felt as if some people thought that if I conceded and said that I was presumptious (instead of defending myself), that I was somehow -- I dunno, it felt like I was making things worse.

I've given it some thought and what I think is happening is there is the standard perspective that many women have, which is "you have to do (or agree with me on) these things, and if you do, then your life will be good, however if you don't you need to admit that you're wrong". those words may not be the exact sentiment, however the core of it is, "I want you to do something so that I can feel the way I want to"

it feels to me like a lot of men are against this. I'd like to break it into two parts here. first of all, was I being presumptious? well, as I said in @[noseblog](2021-05-22 23:46), if it happened in physical it *was attracted*. LOA is always accurate, and so for whatever raeson I appeared that way. it is perceptual, and so there's a lot of room for interpretation. it's often times the case that things appear (or even feel) differently than they are.

when things feel diffeerently than they are, this is an interesting problem because you would think that feelings are your "guidance system" and they are, however there can be a lot of noise. that emotional noise is often times your programming. addictions are the easiest example of this. just cause you feel like spending more time on facebook doesn't mean that is what what you really want to do. sometimes there's another programmed voice on top of it (like addiction recovery or some other mantra or affirmation), however below all of that is how you really feel. meditation helps connect to that voice. there are so many voices (culture, upbringing, friends, family) all telling you what to do, that it's often times difficult to sort it out what is really desired.

when it comes to appearance, it's also programmed[^1]. let's take an easy example of this. imagine you're out on the dating scene or hanging out in a pub or disco and want some affection. common sense states that if you're "too easy", then you don't value yourself very highly. you are there to just be taken advantage of. therefore, because of this value programming, now the other person must perform certain things to assuwe you that you are not "too easy", and therefore have value.

---

this is such a mind-blow for me and is the main reason why I abandoned the whole relationship situation completely. if you believe that people need to perform certain things so that you can feel valued, respected, trusted, etc. -- then you are doing the classic, "I need you to behave in a certain way so that I can feel ____". many people do not really realise how deeply woken into modern culture this idea is.

contrary to this, LOA takes the same idea and completely reverses it: I'll perceive myself as valuable and that will attract people who support that feeling. if I need someone to do something so that I feel valuable, then I have it backwards.

---

ok, back to the subject here. I will now separate this into two parts. the first one was: "did I attract a feeling of presumptiousness?" the answer is yes, and even if that falls into the catergory of programmed appearance, it doesn't matter. the point is, it's still perceived that way.

the second part here is, "do I need to feel bad for causing someone to feel presumptiousness?" the answer is always no. I am not responsible for how other people feel. ever. people can perceive any thing any way they want to.

the way I see it, you could try your absolute hardest to be the biggest douchbag ever, and if I perceive you doing anything to me, that's a fault in my own perception. I can only perceive things that I am also resonant with myself. no one can "do anything to me" (assert anything into my experience) which I am not already resonant with.

so, for me, this is not really a difficult thing. I always take the path of laest resistance.

---

there are some more reactions now. I'll let them settle a bit.

[1]: that is precisely what I'm going to be "rewriting" here in the this next phase, but that's not what I wanted to tslk about.
