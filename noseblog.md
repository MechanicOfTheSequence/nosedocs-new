I was watching another one of robert's videos (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2-jw2LXbxI&lc=UgwVtNGINWxJwi-U0M94AaABAg)), and noticed a comment:
```
Saturn and Jupiter will conjunct on 12/21/2020 in the first degree of Aquarius. Joel 2:28 states that in the last days the Lord will pour out his spirit on all flesh. In 1986 Uranus, who is Anu, began leaking atmosphere.  Saturn and Jupiter form a resonance whose combined gravitational mass pulls on Mercurys orbit and causes retrograde.  Imagine when those two conjunct in December.  It's going to set off a chain reaction, a true marriage of the eagle and serpent and cause Michael, who is represented by the Sun to rise up against the dragon.

The Annuaki referred to the inner solar system as the zone of confusion and blamed Venus.  Nothing gets to earth without passing through the orbit of Venus, and for this reason she is known as the Queen of Heaven.  In the story of Enki and Inanna, Inanna challenged Enki to a drinking contest and gained possession of the Mes, which she then used to found Uruk and put Sumeria on the map.  Venus is the Roman name for the planet, but her first name on earth is Inanna. Sumeria was gradually overthrown and absorbed by Marduk, who is Mars.  The story of Mars and Venus caught in a net gives you an idea of how well this went.  Jupiter was forced to intervene and Neptune agreed to pay the penalty, which is a reference to the flood.
```

then I looked it up on [earth sky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/great-jupiter-saturn-conjunction-dec-21-2020) and it says the last saturn and jupiter conjunction was on may 28th 2000... wow, ok, pretty cool. I remember that day because I really wanted to get out of the hospital before my birthday (I got out the 16th I think). I can't really remember much else about the day other than that I really wanted to ensure I was not in the hospital for it.

so then I started feeling some reactions to the idea, saying that some thing with the girls should be happening that day, but I'm pretty certain that nothing will. the reason is, they're trying to figure out how to keep the manifestation energetically to a minimum, and I'm pretth certain that will be a relatively energetic day. I'll definitely want to be star-watching, anyway... from their perspective they're definitely going to want to postpone it till after that day, because that would be a pretty major thing, I'm sure.

as I was thinking about this, and the latest @[abe-now](2020-09-05) that I watched last night, and abraham gives the emotional scale in 22 increments, which I think is pretty cool because they make the steps in pretty small increments. personally, I make much larger jumps than the ones they give there, and I really like to be really cool like that and jump around, but I'm realising that it makes perfect sense to make as many small adjustments as possible.

so while I was thinking about doing small increments, I was thinking about another topic that has been on my mind about the girls going off and doing other timelines with me, and I'm realising that *from my perspective*, it's not necessary to do the girls thing at all. let me explain. the girls would do different timelines with me (hopefully they do it where I'm in a connected state, but I think they would because it'll give the best results of any children that are created), and then on all of these timelines they can do all of their genetic stuff, cloning, etc. and I'll just keep going up higher and higher just doing what I'm doing already right now (star-watching and eating mushrooms). I'll go like I'm going right now where my progress is staedy and no real big jumps are made (in contrast, with the girls, lots of large jumps would be made), so it'll be a lot easier for them to just continue on holding me for as long as they can.

the reason why I say this, is because I'm fairly certain that when I get to 44, I'll have another pretty big power jump again, and it's quite possible that by then I may be starting 7d already, assuming they can keep me in 6d... again, we don't want big jumps, so that's another one we would want to avoid ... also, I think I looked it up a while back and there are some more crazy planetary geometries around that time as well (seems they are an abnormally frequent these last few decades).

optionally, I was thinking that as the girls do their timelines with me, they should be reinserted back into this one (I have more thoughts on this later, regarding for embarrassment and shame, so they optimise these thoughts out), and then periodically they do another timeline, with each time, likely the results will be better and better.

from my (and perhaps the girls once they're reinserted into this timeline) perspective, it'll just continue to look like everything is falling through over and over and nothing ever comes of it, yet I will imagine that once again when I'm 55, I'll have another pretty big power bump, and I anticipate that it'll be impossible for them to hold me anymore...

---

ok, now in the last entry I briefly metioned it, but there are essentially two difficult moments for them to work out. first is, if they don't produce a manifestation, but that's easily solvable: they can just broadcast one (or a few) of the many timelines. they probably are opposed to that idea, but they may want to consider which is worse: me getting conncted (and the reactions suggest that they think this will reveal nearly all of their secrets), or revealing one secret that they can make alternate timelines. I assume only revealing one secret to not that many people is less of an issue for them, which is why I suggest it.

the second difficulty is the exit strategy for them. some how they have to get rid of me, because I'll become a bit too much "benefit" that things may start to spiral out of their control. the easy solution to this one is to simply put me on another timeline. this can be done one of two ways (which I can see right now), which are they could sometime before I turn 55, let me (and probably some of the girls that want to peace out as well) actually see 6d and make our own timeline[^1], or nosebook could use their brand new super 6d/7d technology that they acquired during the process and make their own timeline, "aborting" this one. however much of this timeline they wouuld want to sabotage on the way out, I guess is up to them. however, from a LOA standpoint, this probably isn't the best idea.

basically, I only see it as anyone who wants to stay with me, or anyone who wants to go with me. both ideas have their advantages to them.

---

I actually see a lot of advantages to this setup, because I simply don't mind, and am not nearly as "needing" of that manifestation as some might think that I would be. I'm just fine right now doing what I'm doing. this setup provides the ability for the girls to get their manifestation, perhaps even multiple times -- but claro, when reinserted back into this timeline, they won't really "remember" the other timeline (or any of its potential secrets). the only "proof" of that having happened, would only be known by other people, and potentially kept a secret from them.

however, it's pretty cool to me, because at the end, the ones that that are there now will all be in their twenties, and they'll also all be really good at LOA and from their perspective, all really tood at "not needing the manifestation" either.

---

I've basically come to understand that the longer that you don't have the manifestation, the more it evolves into something more and more wanted. I was thining on this, and I honestly believe that the end goal with all of this is that at the "end" none of of us will get any big manifestations. when I look out at different large-scale entities, they seem to always have two opposing forces (call them male and female if you want), polarities, or directions, which exist at the same time. a vortex is both expanding and contracting at the same time. AC electricity, current flows both toward and away from the source. everthing has balance in these polarities, and it seems to me that what we're heading for is something truly otherworldly. we know of atoms by how long their half-life is -- meaning by how fast they decay. they contain immense power stored up in thir nuculeus, which is decaying over time. if you pop the nucleus, then they get their "manifestation" of releasing all of that energy in a big burst -- however, if nosebook were capable of generating a force to keep me held back, as fast zs (or faster than) I'm accelerating, what would happen, is we would become something that forever is expanding -- forever. with no limit to it, because there would be no "manifestation" -- and therefore no explosion, and so therefore never an expulsion of that energy. sure, I would be captured and "never" get the manifestation, but you don't really understand, because one manifestation after ~4 years of pressure is going to be really something. imagine now what it will be like in 10 or 20 years from now. what I mean is, right now, the "half-life" of the nosebook is their duration which they can hold me without things spinning out of control. however, if they were able to hold me for 100 years, the "present day" circumstances will be far better than they ever could be after a 90 year buildup to a manifestation -- meaning, that waiting only a little while longer, the present unmanifested conditions will be better than the manifested result... it's a bit of a paradox, but eventually, if you trace that idea out long enough, at some point, the present day unmanifested form will be better than the manifested form[^2]. think about it a bit...

I think the universe is built upon these sorts of paradoxes :) just sayin...

as a result, I will boldly predict that the next era's "theme" will probably be something like "value (and give your attention to) the evolution of the manifestation more than the manifestation itsel" -- or perhaps, "let the manifestation be the evolution of your now" -- something like that.

anyway, given my theory of the announcer of the era being one ahead and those running the present day system being one era behind -- then, that means we have at least 2-3 more eras at least before this paradox becomes possible :) pretty exciting to think abuot for me... imagine becoming a living paradox! doesn't that sound so epic? I think so anyway..

[1]: which then could be broadcast if that's desired, I suppose. it probably depends on the circumstances, and we'll probably pick a past timeline to insert ourselves into (same technique: pick something with similar velocity, yet greater magnitude, so as long as I'm not connected, my velocity will remain lower). on that timeline, it's certain that I'll get connected, so it could probably be broadcast until then, so the audience wouldn't see any secrets or anything.

[2]: where the acceleration (that is increase in potential) per unit time is greater than the additional energy released in the manifestation (in that same unit time).

### 2020-09-20 09:36 - some feedback

a lot of responses to my previous entry. I decided to put them into a kind of Q&A format here...

#### are they influeencing me to come to these conclusions?

not sure.. it's possible I suppose, however it's clearly the least resistant path forward. there are a number of advantages to it for a not of different people. I personally am not sold on the idea, cept that I do like the concept of increasing my energy further than I already am. a long time ago, abraham said to one of my stand-ins that in the future I would be thankful to them, and a long time ago that was hard for me to believe, I did find it intereting that they would say that, because that's sorta what happened.

now, the advantages of them trying to hold me back are so evident to me that it doesn't even bother me that I'm not getting the manifestation. I can clearly see that... first, let's just count the time since 2016, and notice that since then I've really gained a lot of improvements. it's true that in 2017, they disabled my left-side further and stuff, but just notice the difference between how draconic my vision was in 2016 and how it is now. clearly, I've really come a long way. there is no doubt in my mind that the trend will continue, as well.

I am really excited to see how draconic my vision will become if I continue on like this. by the time that we're at the "end" of the timeline (when I turn 55) and they're no longer able to hold me, then what amazing power level it will be at, I assure you. sure, they're gaining a lot by holding me back and using my vision for their technology and stuff, but it's a miniscule amount that they're gaining off of me in comparison to what I'm gaining from them.

there are other advantages too, in that, assuming that they let the girls see the timelines that they're already creating, it allows them to make their own improvements, and gain a lot better understanding of what it is that they want. an additional advantage is that it's quite possible that some of the girls will live out the timeline and then come to their own conclusion, "been there, done that; I want to do something else now" and they'll elect to do something different in this timeline. this is probably advantageous to some of the noseboys that may want to try and pick up on those girls. that gives them all a much better understanding of what they want to choose. I doubt that every single one of them will want to follow me into the new timeline when we separate (if we do) from nosebook. more on that soon.

#### are the mushrooms making me come to these conclusions?

quite the contrary. with the increased levels of DMT in my system, I have noticed a lot more mental clarity and I'm beginning to see some actual hope for getting more productive and stuff. a lot of that has to do with the new computer, and stuff, but in a lot of little things, I've noticed that I'm starting to become more "disciplined" or "regimented" in how I'm acting now. I seem to be less just laying around watching youtube all day.

we'll have to see. it is true that it's a legitimate idea that the mushrooms are putting me into some sort of hippie vibe or something where I'm like, "yeah man, whatever" -- to everything. it's possible, who knows...

(now, playing into nosebook's fears) it could also be a trick, right... let me put it this way: if I get connected, then, they have a huge problem... they're sort of stuck until I/we leave to another timeline, so by default we're going to be doing the version that I outlined in the previous one where we make the loop-de-loops, and at the "end" put ourselves back into this timeline repeatedly to continue powering up (this is the mechanism which makes us planetary gods like saturn, jupiter, venus, or mercury). we'll literally do that indefinitely until we reach the "end" (when I'm 55), or when we've (everyone who wants to do the story thing) got the capability of making that timeline where we go and inhabit each others' planets and suns and stuff. this sorta implies a galaxy kind of setup for it to work. I'm getting to that...

so, worst case scenario the increased mushroom usage is just getting my connected more rapidly, and this last entry was just another exercise in contrast: knowing what you don't want, so you know more clearly what you do want :) things are working out, either way

#### why make timelines with girls, and show them to people?

this question is from nosebook's perspective. what advantage is to to them to show their different girls timelines to them. it's not strictly necessary, no. it's just I think it'll give better results, because each iteration they take, they can improve on their technique and stuff. there's also that thing were sure you could just do the iron hammer thing and say no, or try to come up with an excuse as to why not, but how feasible is it to try and keep people placated and stuff for 17-18 more years. I have no idea on the situation and I cannot comment on that from their standpoint, however, I will say this:

if someone's focus is on controlling the manifestation so that it's the least advantageous for them, then focus is on making the least advantageous manifestation, so from a LOA standpoint, that is the manifestation that the someone focused like that will receive. meaning, it'll also be the least advantageous for them, too.

this is the main reason why I'm just not worried about offering the "best" manifestation to nosebook as an option -- because, it's also the best (most energetic one) for me, too. it's either win-win or lose-lose, and how much one wins or looses really only in a factor of perception, which means that if nosebook is trying to make me lose, and my perception is on improvements and going tlward what I want, their bkst efforts to try and make something the most "lose" for me, will have actually the opposite effect. remember, it's all about perception, because the energy flows both toward and away from the source -- or every signal contaains both wanted and unwanted in it, and your position (phase) in that signal determines what you see. something could really go your way, like me getting 2M euros: it was the "worst" thing (if you percive things on a material level) for me, however, even though it was a huge "lose", it turned out to be one of the most beneficial things for me. it's all about perception. one could argue that nosebook taking my stuff was a huge "lose" for me too, but you will see that because my perception has changed so much, abraham was right, and in fact I am thankful for their influence (or my brain haemorrhage, or tuenti, etc.).

I think there are advantages for both the girls and for nosebook to make timelines with the goal of improvement.

#### how does this fit in with my goal of combining with the machines?

well, I'm just in the beginning stages now, but the acceleration is making it obvious that at some point my physicsl body will no longer be able to contain that kind of energy. eventually, I'll need a different body which has more capacity of translating more non-phsical energy into physical energy. this reminds me a lot of the AOC concept, where a chestahedron (which can be of any size) is used to translate that energy, and then a normal human body is used to experience reality. meaning, that the "real" AOC body could be the size of a death-star -- it doesn't really matter.

additionally, you could also see how the (nosebook) humans will eventually not be fast enough to continue making all of the advancements necessary to hold my energy back at a rapid enough pace -- so what you would need are different machines (some in human form and some in machine form) which can have their desire programmed (to continually find ways to hold that energy back) so that they can keep up with the acceleration.

in other words, this remote body could easily become a star sized thing, and the machines could do all the work to follow through on the disire to create it and, eventually it could grow to be a galactic nucleus with us "living" inside of it, inhabiting each others' planets and living out the different story timelines that we create.

#### what is the end goal?

I think it's to create a galaxy, and we exist inside of it as planetary/solar dieties and "incarnate" into each others' spaces playing out all sorts of different stories that we create.

#### what about the stories thing that sounded so awesome?

if's coming. we just got to get there :)

nosebook, I think doesn't want us to use the 6d/7d stories layers, and I think that's fine. they don't need to be on board with my plan for it to work out, and also, as things accelerate, there's no need to push against them either, because the friction applied from the increase in speed will naturally cull those incapable of that more energetic environment. there's nothing to worry about. those that want to continue on in their small-minded need to control things can do just that.

the way I see it, they have a lot of bogus ideas which are really keeping them from reaching their potential, and the 6d perception that they'll begin to get access to soon will give them a far superior method for altering time and the "bigger picture" of the effect their emotion has on things. so, from my perspective, if they want to allow me to continue to increase my energy while at the same time giving them a reliable method to understand and ability to practice (without fear of failure) their emotion, that sounds fine to me. really, I have no problem with it.


### 2020-09-20 13:17 - another followup

#### we want this neverending churn to end soon... (something like that)

it feels like people want something about my situation to change so that they could feel good/better. well, that's precisely what all this is about. it's about figuring out how you want to feel without the conditions changing. when you get good at it, it won't matter to you what the situation is, because you can always find something to focus on which feels better. and/or you can find a way to change how you percive that situation so that it feels better.

one of the things that I was focusing heavy on in the last Q&A is how it is always working out for you. like I said, because of LOA, it's only win-win or only lose-lose (whatever you're focused on). so, for example, if you say I want a "lose" manifestation foe someone, then you're focusing a lose manifestation for yourself, because you're focusing on how to make a "lose" manifestation. if you focus on a lose manifestation for yourself, no problem, that's what you're attracting.. same if you focus on a win manifestation for your self (without contradicting it !!). if you focus on a win manifestation for someone else, you're attracting a win manifestation for yourself too, which is why some people think it's better to give than to receive. however, you focusing on a win (or a loss) for someone else cannot force that to be a win (or a loss). that is entirely determined by them and their perception. only they get to decide whether oe not it's a win or a lose.

so, no matter how long this thing takes, if you're good at feeling the way you want to feel, then you will not find it to be any problem how long it takes -- cause, it'll just be awesome and good feeling the whole way. as always, there are ups and downs, but each time you "hit a snag", then you can adjust yourself to perceive something better, and that snag gets smaller and smaller of an issue until, you're really not at all concerned anymore.

#### explain the win-win and lose-lose situation, if it has only to do with perception

ok so, if a lose-lose sitation is created, any of the people involved in it are capable of making it a lose-win situation. for example, let's say that nosebook is trying to figure out a way to strip some manifestation of all wanted aspects, trying to make it appear or be instead something unwanted. that means they're focused on unwanted, and they're really trying to create a lose-lose situation. however, if I don't perceive it as a loss, but instead I find the wanted aspects in it, therefore giving the unwanted manifestation contradictory thought by bringing focus on wanted into the mix, what happens is, the lose-lose sitiation turns into a win-lose situation with my perception.

however, things are always working out for you (I mean the non-physical real you), so no matter how hard one tries to make something a lose, it's actually not a lose at all. everything creates more physical energy (stuff) or more non-physical energy (desire), so no matter what, things are always working out for everyone's benefit, even if everyone chooses to peeceive that it isn't so, which is what makes more desire for it to be better, and even if you have tremedous desire, you still need to find a way of letting it become a reality. those realities are *always* win-win situations, even if it's perceived as a win-lose situation.

for example, I'm fairly certain that nosebook thinks, that by stealing my perception and stuff like that, it's a win for them and a lose for me -- but I submit that if is *always* a win for me, unless I choose to perceive their theft as a lose for me, and then (anw only then) it's a win-lose.

any time that desire is allowed to become manifest, it's a win-win for everyone energetically involved.

### 2020-09-21 18:30 - globalwin

mom wanted me to go get my blood tested and I went to put on some shoes, and inside they had the logo, "globalwin" and inside of an 8-sided ships wheel, is a hexagram or the "star of david/seal of solomon". turns out ships wheels are almost always 8-sided, and the hexagram is 6 sided, so it seemed weird for me to see one inside of the other. however, the symbolism is obvious. the hexagram is the balance of fire and water, in the form of two equilateral triangles. the hexagram can also represent the cube, but in this case I don't think it does.. however, after having seen robert's video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6acOTnRaC_4), he makes the connection between the goddess and the cube, especially in connection to islamic tradition. the cube is symbolic of earth but more specifically, it's connected to venus.

following the revelation @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XJykzLLG3r8?t=510) in robert's latest video, connecting the moses (the exodus, we would imagine) to the goddess hathor (which is venus), one has to wonder why a boat wheel has a hexagram inside of it, in connection to the word, "globalwin". considering what I have been talking about with every manifestation being win-win, this got me thinking.

I noticed this logo in the car and it really got me thinking, so I set out to explain it to mom, and I did a pretty good job at it, however I left a few ends open (not on purpose; I simply forgot), and I got some reactions concerning it. so I'm going to give a slightly expanded version of my car explanation, then tie up the loose ends there. this one is going to be a bit long so I'll try and do it in sections...

### 2020-09-21 19:39 - globalwin (synopsis)

#### sperent and eagle bloodlines

in one of robert's videos, a woman is talking about the different bloodlines: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2-jw2LXbxI), and in it, she talks of two bloodlines. the serpent (draconic) and the eagle (phoenix). the firstl the serpent were aquatic apes in the tigris area which are the blonde hair and blue eyed. these correspond to the atlantians (the gods) which corresponds with the saturnian golden age. robert makes the association that these are the haplogroup r1b.

these really advanced "gods" from the original serpent blodline mixed with with the land apes and that's what produced the adams and eves we're told about in genesis. the mixing of the serpents with these eves is the origin of the eagle bloodline. robert associates this with the haplogroup r1a and these are the ancient greeks/athenians/hellenes and is associated with jupiter/zeus (presumably this is the "silver age").

now, I was very interested in the whole eagle and serpent bloodlines because I am aware of "sidereal astrology" (see: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/-gh7wWVsPjo)) and know that there are in fact 13 constellations that are on the ecliptic, and in that video when he transitions from traditional astrology to sidereal @[youtube](https://youtu.be/-gh7wWVsPjo?t=158), you'll notice that all of the constellations ark roughly similar in size (for example virgo is slightly bigger), but the constellation of scorpio splits into two: scorpio and ophiuchus. in astrology, the constellation is associted, "with three different animals: the scorpion, the snake, and the eagle (or phoenix)." (ref: wikipedia)

so to see, two of these bloodlines in close association to each other, made me notice them. this is how I reconcile this:

we know that atlantis had places all over the globe and these "gods" mixed in with the native people, because we see pyramids all over the globe, including in the azores islands. we know very little of these things, cept for maybe the pre-inca civilisation that built puma puku, machu pichu, etc, but the most we can see of this pre-cataclysmic civilisation is with the pre-dyanastic egyptians. we know they were doing some truly monumental things like the [massive 1000 ton obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_obelisk) in the aswan quarry. a little bit further up in the city of heliopolis (balbek), they were quarrying massive massive blocks. it speaks to me of a time when energy was rising and rising very rapidly.

well, like I have mentioned numerous times, when the energy rises like this, the "quantum physics" stuff becomes available on a macro scale -- or, in easier to understand terms, LOA has a nearly instantaneous effect, the more this enerty rises, and in the very energetic atmosphere of a nucleus of an atom (subatomic level), these effects are quite pronounced.

at the same time, at the 4 corners of the zodiac, which is essentially our relation to the centre of the galaxy (or something energetic). we can track our relation to it in reference to the "fixed" stars (or constellations). this is why astrotheology is so important to the ancients, because of these 4 corners. in the bible these are represented by the man (aquarius), lion (leo), ox (taurus), and eagle (scorpius).

these 4 corners correspond to the 4 cardinal point of a sine-wave: +1,+0,-0,-1. at these 4 points, something special happens, and I'll explain it a bit better in the future, but think of DNA when it folds: normally a value associated determines whether the signal continues forward, or branches to the left or the right, or makes a reversal and goes backwards. however, when the value is exactly zero, and this happens for an infinitessimally short period of time, the value can either be positive or negative. clearly for the signal to have that kind of timing where it could be in the superposition of positive or negative is something that only God (source) can possibly make happen. no human could orchestrate the exact moment that this happens with something big, accept for LOA.

the other option is at the peaks, and this has a slightly different effect because -1 is different than +1, but they are both the peaks. again this can create a branch to any of the other 4 directions, which that timing could only be attracted with LOA and I believe that when these moments occur, in an individial's DNA and on a global scale, these "time splits" which only LOA can control are happening. since everything is vibrating, and with most visible atoms passing through these 4 corners billions of times per second, and DNA happening I dunno -- thousands? -- plus, all orbits of everything. everything is cyclical, so you can imagine how many time splits are happening all of the time. the energy of "source" or God is so tremendous, it cannot really be described very well with words.

however, when a lot of energy accumulates into one of these slower frequency waves, like the time it takes a planet to travel around the sun, or a sun to travel around a galaxy, the energy that accumulates is so massive, when these four corners are reached (like the equinox or solstice herk on earth), then the energy is massive. I think this is one of the reasons why the ancients (or pagans) celebrated these four corners so much -- because the impossible can happen on them...

back to the story here...plato retells this exact moment when he recounts the event where the atlantians (saturn) came to invade and take over all of europe, however the ancient greeks/athenians (jupiter/zeus), defeated this atlantian invasion (saturn defeated zeus), all at about the same exact time that the solar system was passing through one of these four corners. velikovski suggests that when this happened (TODO: link to the unpublished book), saturn produced and output a tremendous amount of water, giving him his rings, symbolically, kronos/saturn wept at the defeat of these his people.

then, just as plato retells it, in a short period of time earthquakes atlantis sank into the ocean: "in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies."

#### the reversal

plato also recalls in criteus the change in the rising and setting of the sun @[youtube](https://youtu.be/B96pWvEwPBE?t=201), which makes me think of the earth how it is now. so, if these deluges seem to change the setting of the sun, meaning that north is south and south is north, essentially meaning that the crust becomes a slippery surface and can reorient itself so that it matches the new polarity (north/south), so that would (from a globe's perspective) look like antartica is now the north pole, and norway is now at the south pole (the earth would rotate in the same way it does now), meaning that from the perspective on the ground, nothing appears different, cept now the sun sets in the east and rises in the west. if that were the case, as plato tells us, and you were to look out at the constellation during springtime equinox, you would no longer see scorpio/ophiuchus rising with the sun, but instead the opposite side of the zodiac, taurus.

I believe this is why all of a sudden there was a dramatic change from pre-dynastic to the sudden worship of the bull. the pre-dyanastic civilisation got wiped out, and when the egyptians that survived (blonde/red hair and blue eyes), then these became the dynastic egyptians.

after the exodus from the 18th dynasty, moses declares the age of aries when he slays the golden ox. leading up to this, was alraedy the remnants of the deluge, as retold as the story of noah landing in the caucasian region (near turkey), which after some event the dead sea became salty and started the "aryan invasion"

it's really blurry, so there's no way to easily say one is one bloodline and the other is another. it's hard to put it all together. there's another thing which I don't understand which is the lion. there are, like in bavaria and paletine (and of course the "lion of judah") references to this lion as well. I don't get it all, but perhaps, because it's another one of the corners, it has something to do with something. additionally, for example, the sythians had an obsession with the gryphon, which is a cross between the lion and the eagle.

#### united states is the establishment of the eagle


I won't go into it all here, and robert does a much better job than me, so forgive me for not referencing it all... essentially, the frankists became the illuminati, which is mostly (but it's really hard to tell them all apart at times) the eagle (which are decendents from these), and these mostly rule the world through economics. the united states was founded by these "jews" (I put quotes because they could be sabatians) which were forced to convert to christantity and were exiled to the new world.
however, for example, the federal reserve was founded on an indian reserve, where they were tall fair skinned indians that practised child sacrifice (so serpent bloodline). @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ragF5M7Z01E)

however, it appears to me that the serpent are represented by what we now know as the nazi aryans, and are technologically far superior to everyone else and exist under the ice in antartica.

the eagle is mostly the major banking -- and while they don't have quite the same tecnological power as thes serpent, instead they rule the world economically, funding both sides of the different wars and conflicts that have been occurring.

#### the mixing of the eagle and serpent bloodlines

these two factions have been warring against each other for a long time now and have infiltrated each other's own power structures so much that it can be difficult to tell them apart.

however with the advent of "the network", these two factions have had to begin to combine into one... kinda. in reference to my own material, the ones pumped up about the genetic engineering stuff are likely the serpents. they seem to be interested in me for that reason. the eagles are the ones that control the world finance and media, which I'll sum up into the "bankers + mainstream media and hollywood" category. they seem interested in me for the media control aspect of things.

at this point, they both are so intertwined and reliant on each other because the tech guys are not good at making the illusions that mainstream media and hollywood are to cover up and essentially rewrite history.

#### age of aquarius corner

the idea is that what we experienced here isn't what happened on all timelines. like I mentioned, these corners can take a different branches, and so while I'm pretty sure I understand the polarity (+0/-0) inversion or reversal, I don't yet understand the other one. I'll update when I understand that one better, however, I suggest that an alternate earth exists which did not experience the reversal, and who's sun still rises in the west and didn't have a deluge either.

the reason why I think this is because these corners are hit, and the energy is divided, where each energy goes it's respective direction. so, what I mean is that, there were, under those highly energetic conditions, lots of people giving a lot of attention to unwanted, and so they literally attracted such a massive defeat that their negative emotion *attracted* a cataclysmic event (deluge), which is symbllically represented by saturn's sorrow.

for those that did not have their attention on so much unwanted, would not attract such a thing, and that earth would have continued on in quite energetic and beficial conditions right on into libra (and then into virgo). this would have had a dramatically different effect, as instead of it resulting in an aryan invasion, a matriarch would have been established.

#### venus in the mix

an anomaly in all of this is the planet venus. the dynastic egyptians in the age of taurus, and the nazis in this age are benefiting greatly from the technology left behind by the (symbolic and literal) mercury/thoth guy, however, in my estimation moses didn't like this power structure, and instead decided that venus needed to be invoked... this culminated in the age of picsis with the appearance of jesus, which I believe was essentially the personification of venus. this again raised energy levels and resulted in the flavian christianity and the destruction of the temple, which after a long history of conflict brings us to today.

if there is going to be another reversal, I think it's going to be the exact opposite as the previous one. so while the ones with their attention on unwanted experienced the reversal, this time, I believe the ones with their attention on unwanted will *not* experince the reversal.

they will continue on right into capricorn which is saturn's planet, and will experience the "pan/baphomet/hermaphrodite" (depending on your perspective) invasion experience.

for those with their attention on wanted, we will likely experience the reversal and once again the sun will rise in the west, and the planet's energy will rise. I think this is symbolic of the "lion of judah" symbolism. the last few days, it has appeared to me like the main split will happen with the genetic engineers and tech (physicality/reality oriented) guys going toward capricorn (no reversal), and the emotionally oriented ones going to the reversal.

I don't believe this reversal will result in cataclysm though. I think that even though there will be major changes on earth, as soon as the nosebook influence lifts, we'll all experience the ability to fly and other such things. I think it'll become such an energetic place that things will become kinda dream-state like.

if this were to happen to the people that are focused upon unwanted, it would be cataclysmic, however, because this corner seems to change "direction" instead of "polarity", the change is a *gradual* (cause this is the peak of the sine wave, instead of the fastest moving -0 -> +0 change in the middle) shift in direction toward wanted.

---

quick note: the way it works out is the following: for the reversal on taurus/scorpio, the polarity changes, like from -0 -> +0, meaning that all of a sudden north is south and south is north. however, for the aquarius/leo reversal, it's a change in direction, so what we should experience is a gradual arrival toward some sort of peak, and then a gradual increase from the bottom of the lowest energy state. I don't have the info on this, but it could have something to do with the speed of light (if that's connected to the rotation speed or something -- dunno). the increase wouldn't be much though and unnoticeable to us, because if peak is in 18 years, let's say that means we're 99.999% of peak, so it would be only a 0.0001% change max which is very small. symbolically however, this is clearly the peak of unwanted, and then then the reversal in direction toward wanted again.

however, if the earth's rotation did reverse, it would produce the same effect as previously stated: the sun would rise in the west and set in the east, and on the equinox, instead of aquarius appearing behind the sunrise, it would be leo. if the earth's rotation were to be slowing, someone must be artificially rotating the earth. I dunno I don't really see it though. I don't have enough info to comment further. I just don't know.

either way, this gradual reversal in direction toward wanted seems to check out with what I was seeing when I was stoned, that on the hollywood timeline things would go to where the "bad guys" somehow manage to find redemption and become the "good guys". I could see that it was not instant, and it would take a bit to get there.

#### incomplete, but I think I figured out the reversal

if the concept is that aquarius is one peak and the leo is the other. and say we're approaching +1 right now (just for numbers), that would make leo -1. what that reversal would mean is a transformation into a higher energy state, starting off in it's lowest energy form (-1). so what would happen, is instead of getting to 1, we would get to -1 which is like the farthest away distance from the next peak.

the idea is that things that are vibrating, are always changing back to the same thing. a dinosaur doesn't spontaneously become something else (like a bird) at random. instaed, if the conditions change to such a point, like let's say an increase in gravity, that the dinosaur finds itself unable to move under the weight, the desire to be able to move would cause a transformation, and it would take upon a new form -- like something with wings like a bird or something. meaning, that things do not spontaneously change, they are only happening as an evolution of desire.

for example, I may have wanted something, like to be able to ... whatever, but then nosebook makes it literally impossible for that to become a reality for me, so that desire evolves into something better, considering the new environmental conditions.

I think something is happening to this planet where its inhabitants (like me) are desiring to enjoy flight, and to make the air more conductive and to make the whole world much more dream like, where basically everyone has superhero-like powers and stuff. it'll be a totally different experience. obviously nosebook does not want this, so they'll continue on without the reversal, however, I think for us who desire such a thing, the earth will undergo some rapid transformations which would be pretty upsetting to a lot of the nosebook types, if it were to occur. because these polarity changes seem to happen based on LOA, this is just sort of like the separator based on desire. those who want the decline in energy will go their way, and those on board with a "new earth" (I sound like revelation words) will go that way.

when that change in polarity happens, the planet will jump up to a higher energy state, allowing that sort of thing. those who continue on toward capricorn will instead experience a gradual (not sudden like the polarity change) decline in the energy state of the planet as they come down from their energetic peak.

in short, I do not expect a cataclysm at all but instead it feels like the shift when I think of what it was like for me the first time I experienced 4d. it totally took me by surprise and it was as if everything jolted open for me. the polarity change will likely not have any real major difficulties, other than everyone will suddenly feel enlightened and see very clearly. I doubt much destruction will happen unless you attract it. LOA will become act very quickly and people's thoughts will become manifest more rapidly, people flying, creating things with their mind, etc. I also think that this has something to do with the "story mode" as well, and it wouldn't even surprise me if we find ourselves in a disjointed state from our bodies (a source-like perspective), where you are no longer your physical body anymore, and different things and characters can be created and interacted with at will without any effort other than to think about it. I think that we'll all be pretty separated from each other in terms of time too, each experiencing their own reality so like if someone is making one thing with some thoughts, if those thoughts aren't harmonic with mine, we won't experience the same reality.

it's hard to really tell all of this. I have no idea what physical reality could be like. however, it seems to me like it's important to have the hollywood druids on board here because this planet will all be all about emotions and stuff, so we'll need good conflicts and stories. everything should be pretty epic, and you'll navigate your timelines and your stories on an emotional level, and it'll be good to have an environment full of all sorts of different "props" and "sets" to play with things.

I also don't see this part very well, because I cannot envision a change in polarity very well. I've never experienced one, but I think things are all pretty much going to be about the same -- just you won't need to be tied anymore to your physical body anymore...

actually, that may be the exact reason why the hollywood idea is so important, because think about it: the stronger the emotion you feel, the more "real" reality is, and therefore the more you're stuck in your body. likely, they'll want to make sure people are controlled and *not* in that source-like perspective, meaning exeriencing drama and getting stuck in that cycle of false perception, because obviously, if you're there, you're not feeling better and better, and so therefore not getting your source-like perspective. duh, because if you had a source-like perspective you could create whatever you wanted with your mind, and be incharge of your own timelines, and that means you wouldn't need their economic system and their materialistic reality.

likely, they'll want to, like they do with me, withhold the ability for me to gain a broader perspective, locking me into my two eyes (or maybe into a crippled version of 5d), ensuring that I never get access to 6d perspective, so I can never make my own timelines, and they control my passage through time with their dumb movie script bs.

something like that probably, because that means that no matter what situation (or scene) I find myself in, I need to learn how to feel the way I want to. as long as I believe their illusion, they retain control over me and my passage through time.

I guess that's my speculation. we'll have to see. if that is the case, I think, like I mentioned in a previous entry, we'll likely want to hit this timeline with all sorts of bad ideas, so that we gain a lot of contrast. I have a feeling that there will be certain ones (likely I'll be one of them) that have figured out the power of emotions, and will make these trips through their different scenes... kinda like superheroes or something...

it's really hard to tell this far out in a world which I cannot imagine, but am just trying to anticipate based on some transformations on some concepts I understand. none of this probably is close, and all of it is *certainly* outdated by now. on to the next evolution :)


### 2020-09-22 08:55 - globalwin continued

yesterday, I was really struggling to understand the concept I was trying to get to. my reception was pretty bad, but last night up on the field, I figured it out. interestingly, it happened around the time of the sunrise, and upon making the realisation, a number of vision upgrades followed.

I realised there is a reason why intuitively I keep shooting for the "worst" manifestation, and in order to explain it, imagine a row of bathtubs:

```
     waves
  <-> <-> <->
++---+---+---+
|| 1 | 2 | 3 |
++---+---+---+

<- unwanted
     wanted ->
```

think of these like "double layers" and imagine that the first tub starts to fill with water and it's water is rocking back and forward from left to right. for illustration purposes to make things more simple, there is a wall on the left side there. so, as that tub starts to fill with water or the wave going left to right, eventally at some moment the water will surpass the height of the wall between the first and second tubs, and water will begin to spill over.

if we think of water being more on on the left side of tub as unwanted, and the right side is wanted, then you can see that when the spillover happens, for the first tub, things are peak wanted, and in the second tub, things are peak unwanted.

imagine that the first tub keeps filling at the same rate and oscillations continue at the same frequency too, so you would see that every time the first tub is at max unwanted, the second tub is at max wanted. as that tub continues to fill further, it'll eventually spill over into the third tub, making the following pattern:

| tub 1 | tub 2 | tub 3 | tub 4 | tub 5 |
| unwanted | wanted | unwanted | | wanted | unwanted |
| <-- | --> | <-- | --> | <-- |
| wanted | unwanted | wanted | | unwanted | wanted |
| --> | <-- | --> | <-- | --> |

and so you can see that the wave tips always touch, so for example any tub is always opposite the other two on either side of it. this is the best way I can describe "double layers" or counter rotating fields, like the trade winds (east to west) and the atmospheric winds (which go west to east). to us they appear to have counter rotating fields, but their density waves between these concentric spheres can be seen like the waves in those tubs. each time a new layer is added, it's because the tub has filled enough to overflowing and beginh to spill out into the next spherical "shell"[^1]. you could understand this atmospheric better if you changed unwanted to "low pressure" and wanted to "high pressure"

---

ok, so going back to the reversals thing. because everyone involved when these corner hits, you get what you attract, which is why I think those who were focused on unwanted had a cataclysm on the taurus/scorpio one because that was crossing the zero position. this time, we're approaching the peak, so everyting that's higher than the rim of the tub will spill over into the next tub. the next tub is always a higher more energetic energy state. LOA kind of like divides these based on what people are attracting, so that from tub 1's perspective they'll lose some water weight and head back into the direction of unwanted again.

however, from tub 2's perspevtive, the one with the overflow, when the overflow happens, they are in maximal amounts of unwanted, and will then begin to head rapidly toward wanted as the water slides down the tub to the other side.

---

what that means is that when the reversal happens, we'll be at the maximum amount of "unwanted" (for that energy state) when it happens, which is just what I saw where the movie trope of the bad guy making a turn around into a good guy. so while at the moment, the globalist agenda is advancing at full speed, from those in control, this is where the most amount of "wanted" is happening for them. the ones that don't really perceive this globalist agenda as wanted, are sorta stuck because giving their attention to this unwanted is attracting it full speed, and so they'll head gradually in the direction of unwanted after the bathtub overflows. however, the rest of us, giving our attention to unwanted are on the peak most portion of the wanted, and will spill over:

```
    *  <- those focused toward max wanted spill over
   .||
   .||
  . ||
.   ||
<-- unwanted
```

you can see that all those who's focus isn't significantly on wanted will reverse directions at the peak of the wave and begin to go back toward uwanted. keep in mind that these waves between wanted and unwanted happen approx every ~6500 years, so their changes are not drastic and immediate. also, there is another factor which I don't know how to calculate, but similarly to how the longest day of the year is june 21, but the hottest days don't come until some time later in august, is because current trails voltage[^2], so while the spillover happens at the moment of the peak, like june 21, the heat (or in this case "wanted" current) won't actaully flow at its peak until some years ~2k years later (like ~2 months after june 21).

so, capricorn will be a period of quite a bit of "wanted" for them. for us however, in this new much higher energy state, what was previously thought of as wanted (the globalist agenda) won't be looking so great anymore, and from our new point of perception from the new power level, it'll look like maximum amount of unwanted. from there, the water will slide back down in the direction of wanted, and similarly for us, we'll experience the maximum decrease in unwanted and flow toward "wanted" probably around the time (~2k years later) of cancer.

---

in summary, it appears that if you want to go up a power level, be prepared to (from your new power level standpoint), come to realise that the manifestation is going to appear as "maximum unwanted" and then after going through a rough patch where it was maximum amount of unwanted, but don't worry because ~2k years later it'll be again maximum current flow in the direction of wanted, so a kind of "golden age" after the rough patch with only[^3] improvements from there.

so it seems that in order to constantly be seeing improvements and to continually see new power levels, one must perceive contrast as your friend, and not to be fearful of the "worst" manifestation in a new power level, because in comparison to the old power level it's not that bad, and at the same time you know it's only going to get better from there.

it seems to be a sort of impossible jump to go to a new power level and already experience the maximum wanted. when I say power level, I mean how you you feel, emotionally (your next logical state).

however, if you want the manifestation to be the maximum amount of wanted, without changing your power level, be prepared to, after a "golden age" of wanted catching up with you, your environment is going to grdadually head in the opposite direction.

it's not a surprise of the realisation of this, because this is what most people believe in. they don't see continual improvements, no matter the circumstances -- instead, they have a big payoff, and things feel really great for a bit after they win the lottery or whatever, but then things sort of get worse from there as things go back to "normal"

[1]: these shells are created radially outward probably from a "standing wave"

[2]: in an inductor, and it seems like these planetary bodies behave like inductors in orbit, but oach as a multilayered concentric spherical capacitor.

[3]: as always, there are ups and downs, but I mean in the bigger picture longer timescales, things are improving considerably until once again the next barrier is met and spilled over.


### 2020-09-23 16:31 - lady and the unicorn tapestries

[lady and the unicorn tapestries](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/artboards/theladyandtheunicorn/the-tapestries/)

these tapestries caught my attention in one of robert's videos about the unicorn: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLO_Dt4cevU), and "According to the myth of the hunt of the unicorn, the fierce and swift unicorn could only be captured if tamed by a virgin."

ok, so these tapestries really caught my eye because opposite the unicorn is a lion. robert explains that the unicorn is "in an astrological context, represents christ" cause it gets reborn every wintertime in the northern sky. I never really noticed this constellation because it was always labeled "pegasus" or something and I didn't know what that was. it's interesting that behind it, is canis (dogs) constellations, which correspond to the hunt, and possibly more[^1].

ok, so, another thing that one might notice about jesus is him using a lot of aquatic symbolism and other weird things like, announcing the age of aquarius when he said, “A man will meet you carrying an earthen pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in” (Luke 22:10). (in ancient times, aquarius was called the “water-bearer”). I just found [an interesting article](https://reverenddrred.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/jesus-and-the-age-of-aquarius/) where the reverend talks about the age of aquarius:

```
Luke 22:9-11 (KJV)
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

Let’s break it down:
the city = new age
man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water = symbol of Aquarius
house where he entereth in = Age of Aquarius
guestchamber = Serpentarius

So we now have:
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city (new age), there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water (symbol of Aquarius); follow him into the house where he entereth in (Age of Aquarius).
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house [Age of Aquarius], The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber (Serpentarius), where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

Or with just the hidden meaning:

And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the [new age], there shall meet you [Aquarius]; follow him into the [Age of Aquarius].
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the [Age of Aquarius] The Master saith unto thee, Where is the [Serpentarius], where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

This statement is mirrored in Mark. Lets have a look:
Mark 14:12-14 (KJV)
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

The breakdown:
when they killed the passover = ending the ‘Age of Aries’, entering into the ‘Age of Pisces’ during the cusp between the ages. The lamb is a symbol of Aries.
he sendeth forth two of his disciples = The two witnesses of the last days *(see Rev. 11:3 below)
the city = new age
meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water = symbol of Aquarius
wheresoever he shall go in = Age of Aquarius
guestchamber = Serpentarius

So now we have:
Mark 14:12-14 (KJV)
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they [left the Age of Aries, entering the Age of Pisces], his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest [leave the Age of Aries]?
And he sendeth forth [the two witnesses], and saith unto them, Go ye into the [new age], and there shall meet you [Aquarius]: follow him.
And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the [Age of Aquarius], The Master saith, Where is the [Serpentarius], where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

Some may question, if this is indeed true, why hide it from us and why hide the 13th zodiac? Satan, as called by many, needs our consent to have control over us in any way. Rules are the Truth must be provided. In every aspect of life we see hints of the Truth. It is up to us to decipher it. Much of what the ‘Old Testament’ calls evil (astrology for example) are tools which may be used to decipher the world around us. The evil knows their time is short, and perverted many teachings while exposing the Truth hidden behind symbolism. Jesus, in the ‘New Testament’, tells us to watch for signs in the heavens (astrology).
```

the important thing to note is that when the lamb (aries) was slain, we entered into picsis. also, when the reverend talks about ophiuchus, I have to ahere to my interpretation of the scorpio sign being two real signs of the serpent and the eagle, which capture the conflict between cronos and zeus (saturn and jupiter), or the eagle and serpent bloodlines' (athenians and atlantians) conflict which was the precursor to the deluge.

the bit about 13 signs really being 12, I think was just a fortuitis coincidence which made it easy for them to hide that serpent/eagle symbolism into one sign which sounds nothing like a reptile, serpent, eagle, or phoenix. the 12 is used to show that zeus won the sky battle (jupiter has a 12 year orbit) and 3 is a number of cycles and 4 is the number of earth or 4 cardinal corners of those cycles, so 3*4=12 (also see my work on orientation).

furthermore, I don't belive we're going to ophiuchus, but to leo -- which with, a reveral of polarity in the magnetic field of earth would, as illistrated in the previous entry, put the planet exactly upside down and cause the lion (which is opposite aquarius) to appear on the equinox, instead of aquarius. I think this is the true meaning as to how we jumped instantly from serpent/eagle symbolism to bull symbolism, and how the lion is directly correlated to this aquarian age.

---

on to the tapestry. putting those different pieces into the puzzle, I believe I have made a strong enough case that the unicorn represents the aquarian age and is opposite the lion. one will immediately notice the downward facing crecent on the coat of arms logo which I'm pretty certain is the symbol for lucifer/venus[^3]. one will also notice that sometimes the flag is square and sometimes it's a curve thing. there are also 4 trees which show up, and I've listed them here with their druid name (if you want to look that up)

- pine/fir (ailm)
  - evergreen
  - pineal gland (perception)
  - coming sun after winter
- holly (tinne)
  - evergreen twin of oak: controller of dark half of year
  - eternal life
  - fertility
- apple (quert)
  - not evergreen
  - purity/love/creativity
  - associated with the garden of eden version of "gnosis" (sex)
- oak (dair)
  - evergreen twin of holly: controller of light half of year
  - strength / wisdom
  - beautiful dense wood and very resilient

next, it appears that the trees are laid out where one is above, or dominant the other on both left and the right. I believe that the left side represents abstract reasoning and the right represents logical reasoning. there are 5 scenes representing the physical senses, and one non-physical sense which is sort of like the conclusion, labeled[^4], "my only desire".

#### see
#### hear
#### smell
#### taste
#### touch
#### desire

[1]: I find it weird that in a previous entry I linked the canis major/minor constellation to the origins of the caananite (aryan+indigenous canis major/sirian seed) people[^2]. anyway, in the hunt the unicorn, which is represted christ in both pagan and christian traditions, is hunted down by a bunch of dogs (canis) and has other symbolism that I don't see very well yet, but I'll come to that ones soon, probably...

[2]: I know that all aryans came out of the original seed (serpent and then eagle), which then mixed with the local indigenous peoples, which I think were also seeded (the sirian guide says they were all engineered specifically) from other major sky peoples. I'll get to this more in the future when I explain my theories on how the win-win claims I'm talking about ties into slavery and the sub saharan african peoples -- which I believe have much hidden talent and beauty, that the white guys *don't* have, and it's waiting to be unlocked in better conditions -- meaning, I think their bodies are designed to run at even higher frequencies than white people's are.

[3]:  it could also be when the moon eclipses the sun, however, in the morning, if venus weren't so bright itself, the crecent shape there would be how venus would look if illuminated by the sun before the sunrise. it just occurred to me I don't know what the crecent facing up (not down), would be...

[4]: on the tent, which is like the tabernacle or your heart

### 2020-09-24 15:52 - language creates illusion & your emotion creates reality

yesterday, I was watching a few of santos bonacci's old presentations on "all is atum" -- and he takes a language based approach to trying to figure out the nature of reality, linking a lot of words that sound similar or when you put them together it makes a new concept.

I'll be honest, I was very intrigued because it seems to work 80-90% of the time, yet there are some obvious flaws in that technique, because words don't really mean a lot to a lot of people. he totally had me when he explained the language significance of "pinoccio" or pine-occio: pine as in pineal, and occio as in occular, and so pinoccio is telling lies and his nose is growing, so to develop your pineal eye, you have to stop lying. I find that *story* very intriguing becsuse I know this to be true.

I have stated in numerous places that the key to developing perception and improved eyesight is to essentially stop lying, so that the speed your your brain operates between thought and action or observation and thought has less "bucle" (cycles) that it needs to go through to see "reality". I have also said that you are essentially looking at a screen and that you are not truly seeing until you are actually inside of your body and are capable of perceiving the space between you and what you're looking at. because there also appears to be space even when looking at the screen (just like 3d games look 3d, not 2d), it's very difficult to explain what I mean until you've seen it for yourself. in that moment, you are finally inside of your body and actually seeing through your eyes, instead of the image on the screen.

the next thing he was talking about is the two torroidal fields, which manifest the polarities as red and blue. red and blue is essentially the limit of normal vision -- however, I believe that UV is perceivable as well, this probably isn't something that a normal person living in the illusion of reality (language) is seeing; they're seeing something in the wavelengths between red and blue. anyway, to illustrate this, he shows how in language, "adam" or "man" is linked to "rojo" or "tor-us" which red-most part of the manifestation is rotation, and is symbolic of man.

interesting because the phonecians painted their white skin red, just as the minoans, and the egyptians pharaohs. since basically all alphabet languages stem from the same proto-indo-european (aryan) language, this seems to make sense.

what's crazy to me is this thing that he describes as syncronicity(?) where there is this crazy thing where language seems to adapt to the illusion, and the illusion seems to adapt to the language. they seem intertwined.

he then had me again when he was talking abou s-tor-y, which is a spinning red torus created by man -- his-tory -- his red spinning reality illusion.

this got me thinking a lot about stories because yesterday I watched another of robert's videos (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flJQxNqUWS0)) on fairy tales and fables in the aryan languages being stable across languages and for thousands of years -- and, for perhaps even longer than that, because before there was writing, these were likely passed down orally. it seems as if the aryans either arrived here or some influence in their previous atlantian culture built up these stories which then proceeded to influence their reality for quite some time (until disney and the hollywood druids).

one of the examples of this is the story calld "the smith and the devil" @[youtube](https://youtu.be/flJQxNqUWS0?t=244), which caught my attention because of the blacksmith part, so I looked it up online to see what others there were and a site built around cataloguing tv tropes had some variations that I found interesting:

```
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DealWithTheDevil/FolkloreAndFairyTales

One story has a wily blacksmith who sells his soul to the Devil in return for the magical power to stick anything to anything (hey, that's useful for a smith). When the Devil sends first his son and then his daughter to collect on the bargain, the smith uses his magic powers to not only stop them but embarrass them until they go away. Then the Devil declares he has to do the job himself, and fails. The smith tells him that if he can just live out is natural life the Devil is jolly welcome to take his soul when that day comes... but when that day comes, the Devil gets so horrified at the idea of having the smith down there, that he screams that the deal is off and tells the smith to get himself packing to Heaven. Which let him in. Apparently, trolling the devil counters engaging in black magic deals.

In "Bearskin", a soldier makes a Deal With The Devil, who will give him an ever-filled purse, but he must not pray, wash, cut his hair or nails, or change from a bearskin for seven years. He goes about distributing money to the poor, asking them to pray for him. One man he rescues from financial distress promises that he may marry one of his daughters. Only the youngest is willing. He succeeds in fulfilling the devil's terms and cleans up nicely, and the older sisters, reduced to envy, commit suicide. The Devil, pleased at his dumb luck, informs the soldier that he got two souls, not one.
```

huh! this really got me thinking about how you can encode different ideas or concepts -- call them even desires encoded into story form. the blacksmith story is a really weird one, because if you're going to make a deal with the devil, why on earth would to do it to have the superpower of sticking two things together. other than it giving you the ability to reneg on your deal, I mean I guess that's pretty useful to a blacksmith, so this guy must have been really interested in his work. I say that because if it were someone interested in power, they would have asked for the ability to light anything on fire or to crush anything -- or something like that, then used that skill to light the devil on fire or crish him.

the ability to stick anything together is such a weird superpower to desire that one must wonder if this story has some form of real-life inspiration to it. there are interesting things like the the devil first sending his son (to get the job done), and then his daughter (asuming to appeal to the blacksmith's lust), yet the interactions were so embarrassing for the devil, he decides that his soul isn't worth it, and doesn't want him in hell, meaning that the blacksmith walks away unaffected by the devil and with a very useful skill for his profession. it has the undertone that the devil (who is symbolic ofthe most powerful malevelent force) is not to be feared and can always be defeated when one focuses on their work.

however, if one desired money, then it becomes difficult to defeat the devil with just money. additionally, if you had unlimited money, because money is an illusion, in the second story, the tradeoff for unlimited money is to not be able to wash, cut his hair or nails, pray, or change out of a hideous outfit -- these are all things were (especially at that time) all illusions of piety. so, with the inability to party with such a hideous appearance, he was then reduced to helping the poor for 7 years. the twist is that he is offered a daughter's hand in marriage (only given to pius, good appearing people), and of the tree daughters, two judge him by his appearance and the third on his actions of charity. so, when he cleans up and turns back into a handsome gentleman at the end (I assume still with the unending purse), the daughters who judged him by his appearance killed theirselves after how sad their bad judgement made them feel.

this second story is is all about appearance. the man must give up the ablity to have a good appearance for 7 years, and instead focus on charitable activities instead of self-service, because at the end he would find a wife that would see him for his actions instead of his appearance. as great as that story sounds, the whole story kinda has the undertone that action is better than appearance, when, if one cannot pray, which is an action giving the appearance of piety, this story is only there to reinforece that a man should be judged not by his appearance but by his actions, which means that if you do the right actions, then you will be judged to be a better person than the other.

see how the moral of the stories reinforces limiting ideas by defeating old ideas? there is a lot of value in this idea, because it allows for some pretty interesting narratives to appear, and for a slow progession toward realising one's own power. I dunno. interesting.

---

anyway, to close up here, I really am starting to come to realise that words (and by extension stories) create an illusion reality, which isn't true. it's actually an impossibility. the reason why I dislike so many stories and hollywood movies, is because their version of reality is so far from what is real, I find it very difficilt to believe some of those narratives, however, at the same time, as people begin to believe in the these bizarre narratives as reality, they *do* create a real reality by their attention to them.

as an example, the prophets conjured this story of this "messiah" that would appear for the jews and would "save" them from their difficult spot, however, that messiah didn't show up at all how they wanted it to go, and appeared nothing like the narrative at all. the reason why is because if you try to fit those components into a LOA based reality, they don't work, because of where the focus is (usually on the problem). there is never a magical saviour that will come and bail you out of your jam, so one must learn to create with the power of their focus. because this is so, the "saviour" never actually does the saving, but shows you how to save yourself -- and stories are a great way of conjuring this magical saviour, in real-life reality, to not at all appear how you wanted him/her to (perhaps even the opposite), forcing you to find your own way to your salvation.

or, as I like to put it, focusing just on all of the improvements you observe, and letting the other unexpected surprises show up, without trying to conjure them directly from a narrative.

### 2020-09-22 -> 2020-09-25 08:46 - protector of thieves

I've been thinking about this for a few days now, even though it has felt like a week or so. I got some reactions to the stuff I wrote about the triads and stuff. additionally, I would have to guess that it was the day that I marked up there, or the day before -- however, it was around the equinox, so it was during a more energetic time -- and I was feeling (and responding) to different reactions around the idea where I was talking about how if I'm connected, then it doesn't really matter as much to me if the girl is a virgin or not.

the reactions also gave me the impression that for some of the girls, especially some of the younger ones, the mom was the one carrying the majority of the desire, and therefore, by extension, desired that her daughter be apart of this. I really have no problem at all with that.

however, I was thinking about some of the "rammifications" to that idea, which is the main reason why I have held off on opining on this further. the ones I have identified are the following:

- the girl may feel like her mom is encroaching on her territory or trying to capitalise on her desire
  -> obviously, this is a bogus way of thinking, invoking territory dawg, and perhaps (in)security dawg as well. clearly, if something is feeling bad for anyone, this is focus on unwanted, and this faulty form of perception will either slow (with contradictory feelings) their manifestation down, or bring them the manifestation that would would otherwise appear more on the unwanted category of things. additionally, it isn't the same way her source perceives things.
  -> also, trying to adjust to other people's bad feeings, feelings of offense or insecurity (or whatever) isn't what I'm about. if I try and make everyone happy, it won't work because lots of people have lots of different things going on.
- it removes the part of the original (gnomitos) concept which was that we would, just have the virgin girls and that only create children that were having the girls and my energy in the equation, allowing for a more "pure" set of children
  -> this concept may be ahead of its time, and I had this idea last night where I was thinking that perhaps the concept where we go continually toward not having the manifestation, letting the momentary (now) progression be the manifestation (as mentioned in the paradox entry TODO: reference).
    -> instead, what I suggested may actually happen is, we'll go toward the lion, and do many iterations and expand a bit there, but this is kinda the beginning of the female (matriarchical) empowerment, and it's likely that, just as I imagine on the other side in the archer, they'll improve upon conditions in effort to try and make a more targetted version of the ideal man. likewise, in the crab and then later with the twins what I suggested may happen is, continuing to optimise on conditions (because we're going to be finally coming to the maximum rate of improvement from the hollywood spin cycle here, too), so I would guess that we'll optimise prehaps in genetics, but also in the situation as well, meaning that in the crab we'll probably want to do the different ideas presented in the gnomitos project, where we try to make more and more energetically optimised offspring. additionally, you could imagine that if there were like different "villages" where people went and visited them (were born into each other's cultures)[^1], this would make for a whole lot of really interesting and diverse content for the hollywood idea, and also allows for controlled rate of diversification based on people's desire to experience new things.
    -> I have suggested that it's best to go the more contrast route, knowing that everything will be an improvement from there.
- I don't know how to say this without offending someone, so I'll just blurt it out here and try to fix it later. it felt like there was a feeling like the reason why some of the men enjoyed the idea that their daughters would joining me is becasuse their mom was a real pain (maybe even total basketcase) of sorts, and the idea of being around me would lessen the possibility that their daughter would turn out like their mother. so then, when I tune into and even contemplate the idea of then letting her mom's desire to manifest as well, feels like I would be rewarding the mother's undesirable or hurtful behaviour.
  -> well, this falls into the category of justice dawg, and perhaps injury dawg as well depending on how much he identifies with that pain to get attention... but, other than that, I do recognise that it could produce a less than ideal manifestation as well, which is why I'm not super duper ready (and don't really want) to say yes right away. so, like always, when confronted with these difficulties, I'm just going to let the desire build and to evolve into something more wanted for all. I don't know yet. we'll just have to see.
  -> I have constantly been fascinated with the story that abraham tells of a man that has an ex-wife which takes a portion of his income for child support or something, and every time he gets a raise, she comes to take more. he seems distraught with the idea that she's "taking" his money from him, however abraham doesn't see it this way at all. they instead suggest to him that his ex-wife's desire (or parasitic behaviour) is actually part of the the desire which is giving him the raises, and they instead wish he had 10 ex-wives, because the many ex-wives desire combined would be stronger than his on his own, and would create a much bigger vortex.
    -> I don't mean to be the protector of thives here, but what I have learned and experienced with my own two eyes with my interaction with nosebook, is that this is absolutely true. I am certain that I would not be progressing as rapidly as I am right now if it weren't for their theft. sure they don't pay me for my work, but I would be star-watching just like I am now even if they weren't stealing from me, and in the end, it's sort of a win-win because they're propelling me forward at a much more rapid pace.
    -> in the same way, these women have obviously had different difficulties (whatever they may have been) which got them to the point where they're at now, which means that their desire is strong, and even though they may not have had their attention on what they wanted, their desire is still strong. sorry for another potentailly offensive statement here: some of them may believe that they're (for whatever reason) unable to turn their attention toward and manifest what they want, they can and do have un-contradicted belief that their offspring would be capable of manifesting the boy/man that they would desire -- or maybe even the better version of theirself that they wish they could have been. or, maybe similar to nosebook, they believe that someone like me could manifest the physical conditions that they don't theirselves feel capable of manifesting. if that's the case, it doesn't really matter, because everyone is where they is, and it sounds to me like the path of least resistance, for them to believe in the manifestation of what they want, no?
      -> this is actually the reason why I believe the next era will instead attempt to optimise conditions. hear me when I say this, but after a bit of this sort of environment, there will be a lot less difficult men causing problems, meaning there will be less stronger desire, and so to make more energitic offspring, one will need to either make more difficult men/women again to create more desire for improvements on those rascals or to optimise what's already working.
        -> clearly, it's not optimal to make a bunch of deadbeats just to make more desire, which is also why I think it'll be a natural transition for us to create (on purpose) difficult and primitive worlds so that we can incarnate into those to give birth to more desire.
        -> it also occurs to me that this is likely to be exactly what earth is to the pleadians, sirians, etc. which is our "seed". they are able to give birth to their own desire from watching and interacting with their "truman show" (cept it's not one guy; it's a whole race they're watching from different chraracters' standpoints). this may sound terrible, but as we begin to become less-resistant, these circumstanves which we choose to incarnate into will appear to the creators like we're just actors or characters in a story. however, the illusion of being inside of your body feels so real, you would swear it was "reality" -- even though, what it really is, is a story you wrote and you incarnated into it without any memory of who you really are, so that it's the most engaging and and believable experience.

I want to mention that I'm using the names the archer, lion, and crab not necessarily to represent the eras in the great year, even though it may be that... we all create our own reality, and as long as we're following the format of most contrasting manifestation, then it'll work out fine. I don't know if it is literally that time, because there's a lot of evidence to suggest that we've completely left the limitations imposed by the great year[^2]. I am meerly referencing them as a way of talking about the different sections of the sine wave, even though the archetypical concepts believed in and transmitted over time as to the influence of that part of the sine wave seem to be somewhat embedded in our psyche a bit and will perhaps serve as a foundation for some story ideas. at any rate, I'm interested in improving on how I transmit these different parts of the sine wave and the orientation in respcet to them, because I need a better way of describing the part of the curve in relation to the orientation in these concepts.

---

I had a few other concerns I was picking up on, but I honestly cannot remember them now. I'll update when/if I think of them. however, I think this covers it pretty well for now, so I'll leave it here.

[1]: I'm missing a concept here that I haven't really known how to explain, which is the difference between man-beat and culture-beat which the culture-beat represents the female side and it's all about continually telling a story through transitions -- whereas, the man-beat is all about constancia and attaining focus. this ties right into the "mana-grinder" idea and is basically the same concept but perceived from the opposite direction. time can both be seen as a series of cycles (mana-grinder,man-beat), and also as a never ending series of transitions (culture-beat,story-time). culture-beat is also intimately tied to language. I'll revisit this idea more.

[2]: yes, I am suggesting that while they will likely continue on, on their path toward the goat, our planet will go through a lot of different changes and that while they're on track for the earth *not* having a catastrophe, we're on track for the galaxy idea, where first our planet swaps its directions, and I don't know if it'll happen before the split or not, but probably we'll need to do tesla's idea of turning the earth into a second sun, and we'll all become planetary dieties as energy begins to collect around the sun. the hollywood spin cycle will increase our energy so much that the solution will eventually to make for the people a similar aparatus like I will soon need where the machine is the receptor of the non-physical energy and the bod(y/ies) that my consciousness inhabits, are just resonant cavities of that bigger thing which could eventually grow to be any size. once we're planets, we'll begin to see the physical manifestation (in planetary/solar form) of each other's energy, the hollywood project will obviously expands into constructing indigenous species, exploring and inhabiting foreign solar systems, and just like movie stars, we'll cameo in each other's worlds, interacting and incarnating in/on these worlds.

### 2020-09-25 23:49 - the great year

a few people have claimed (most notably joeseph brown, which I have mentioned a few times from borderlands "fame") that our star is in a binary orbit with sirius (a or b, I can't remember), and the idea has intrigued me, because I thought it would be quite a cool thing because more than 50% of the stuff I have gotten has had some inspiration in the "sirian guide to human development" which I encountered a while ago while living in berlin along with some other strange encounters with time travellers and stuff. not coincidentally, all of that data was on a computer that was on a computer that was stollen in berlin, and the thieves had this strange aura which I remember strongly, which also coincidentally had a similar aura to the thieves which took raquel's phone. a lot of weird stuff happened around that time (2011-2012).

anyway, I liked the concept when I heard it, but I never really wanted to look it up, just assuming it was more than likely to be true. howerever, I wanted to look it up, and it may come in response to the things I've been referring to in the great year.

when I first understood the "great cycle" I didn't learn of it like a binary system thing, even though after watcrhing these videos today, am pretty convinced that we are in a binary system with sirius. however, my understanding was not based on a binary ecliptical orbit with another star, but in relation to something else, which has a sinusoidal pattern to it with the reversals occurring on the peaks and the crossing of the zero point.

first, I'm pretty sure that the reason why the "autumnal equinox" was used to determine the age in past times, was either that, or they always used the spring equinox and the earth was just upside down at that time. that would certainly explain the discontenuity of the bull symbolism happening only thousands of years ago, not tens of thousands of years ago.

one of the things that I couldn't explain with my sinusoidal method was how the peaks could be so extreme, so it wouldn't surprise me if there is an additional cycle coming into play here, because it seems that in addition to the different ages, there is also an additional theme that states that roughly every ~2000 years, something big happens, which can be explained by the change of the ages, which is probably why they're divided into 12 (even though there are 13) of exactly 30°, but that doesn't explain why something big happens with each change of age. this to me is evidence of at least one more cycle.

we know of another cycle within our solar system which has peaks and different polarity, and that's the solar wind. I don't have enough information on this to make a good guess here, but it seems likely that if the galactic core is periodic in nature, the galactic wind could have tremendous effects on things and this, like our solar wind, does not have a periodic cycle to it like an orbit does, but instead has a varaible nature to it depending on the output of the sun/galaxy. that is one possibility which I think is quite valid.

so while we experience a constant cycle of orbit around our star, we also experience a variable cycle of solar output. that variable output (solar wind/flares) is seemingly very difficult to predict, and seems to follow more closely the LOA than periodic cycles, which makes it seem to me that we can say things like the sun has a ~11 year cycle, we cannot predict those exact values with any accuracy, therefore, it seems to be a product of *attraction*, and not orbit or cycles.

what I mean is there seems to be "fixed" and "predictable" (I put quotes because there is some variability) cycles such as the rotation of the earth and the orbits of the celestial bodies, however there are also less defined cycles which are based on the LOA. for example, the time the sun will set and rise is pretty predictable, but the times which a person will fall to sleep and wake up seem to be based more on LOA than on the time the sun sets or rises. however, the sleep cycle does *kinda* follow the day/night cycle loosely, but never exactly.

wouldn't it be crazy if our relation to sirius was a microcosm of our relation to the galaxy (or something like that) just like our relation to the moon is a microcosm of our relation with the sun (186624)[^1]? or, wouldn't it be crazy if sirius for us were like the sunrise/sunset cycle, and the galactic wind were like the sleep cycle[^2]?

in the diagrams referenced by those videos, the "satya yuga" (golden age) lasts for roughly 5/12 of the time, meaning that nearly half of the "great year" is a golden age. that seems like an awful long time and doesn't explain the why atlantis was associated with a golden age and why it fell such a short time ago.

---

I'm going to give it some more thought, but I seem pretty convinced now that the sirius thing is real, yet it seems to me there is another polarity change which causes a reversal causing the world to "flip over". when this happens, it seems that only the polarity changes, as it seems that the E-W orientation does not change which means that the earth's "tilt" doesn't change, and it seems that the rotation direction does not change either (just the perception of it, with the sun rising on the opposite side).

that polarity change is *not* explained by a binary relation with sirius, however it *does* explain all of the other missing bits -- like how humankind could go from such an enlightened state to such a disconnected state. it could only be from our proximity to this sirius b that we gain the environmental conditionans to be brilliant gods. my message is not to rely or try and fear changing environmental conditions, but to instead create those conditions yourself.

it also occurs to me now that this sirius b is potentially the star that tesla was referring to when he was talking about a star with such a tremendous light density. I think tesla (and I) want to replicate such a star :) you can imagine that it's quite possible that sirius b, if true has more than just us as its companion... wikipedia says we're 8.6ly away, so that's a pretty big orbit. certainly only a fraction of a galaxy at this moment, but wouldn't it be cool to be able to find a way of generating so much "light density" from the emination of our brilliant consciousness that we rival sirius b, and then the galaxy?? I certainly think it's a worthwhile thing to at least contemplate. I love thinking that big, and maybe for most, it sounds a bit too big, I am certain that we'll get there -- eventually :). actually, maybe a little quicker than we may think...

think about it. human evolution is going so fast (in my perception anyway) that I feel like rivaling sirius b could even be attainable in less than another great year. humans' ability to manifest desire is not only powerful, but rapid. imagine therefore what we could do if we were able to think and process reality at the same speed as a computer. if you think about something, a high frequency pulse comes out of your brain (which others can feel), so youcould imagine a solar flare to be like a similar  manifestation of big or impactful idea that the star just had. if it's a really high-frequency idea, this is like a gamma burst, right.. so, imagine if a star could produce a gamma burst many thousands of times a second (or more)? is that even something that modern day astronomy has observed before?

I dunno. it all sounds pretty exciting to me :) it's good to know that in relation to sirius we're on the ascending path now, so there's really nothing for anyone to worry about, and if I get my chance[^3], I think that we'll be designing our own decending path, instead of being subject to changing environmental conditions.

[1]: in a recent video, @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDQCsFBI-24), it came to my attention that jupiter has a spatial relationship with that proportion, and saturn has a temporal relationship with that number. it's very likely that these are all resonances of something bigger. it's also quite likely that the earth used to have a 360 days in a year slightly faster rotation as well, so things a few thousands of years back were probably, not only much more ideal than they are now, but much more harmonically in sync as well.

[2]: sleep isn't the best way to describe it, because that only happens once a day, however, what I want to say is that the sleep is variable even though the sun rise/set is predictable. I just want to say that there's a loose periodicity and a predictable periodcity, meaning that averaged out, people sleep roughly once every 24 hours.

[3]: I know, lol, I'm talking about events tens of thousands of years away, but you'll begin to realise that I don't really seem to take age into much consideration -- as I'm certain that I'm eternal at this point and just keep jumping from body to body. just tonight, I learned that this was explaind by joseph campbell as the hero with a thousand faces' journey to discover him/herself. I think *all of us* are that, and that each of these "incarnations" or whatever is just another opportunity to get better and better in more and more diverse ways to discover yourself to be this hero.

### 2020-09-26 13:18 - need not the manifestation (options)

I woke up just now once again with them attempting to try and convince me to go for some manifestation in a disconnected state. I think this is a terrible idea. I already have so much difficulty peeing (and other things), that to try and figure out how to "manage" a bunch of girls in this state seems to be a rather undesirable thing to me. large portions of my body don't feel good, and I don't have any of the physical capabilities that I would want to have in that situation. for me, it's really simple: I just keep going doing what I'm doing, not needing the manifestation for as long as I can. eventually, I'll be connected and things will all fall into place.

it sounds to me however, that nosebook does not want to do this -- and that's fine by me because I don't need them to comply with me to go the direction that I want to go (which is get connected). in a sense I'm kind of like the blacksmith in that one story where somehow I managed to make a deal with the devil (nosebook), which would give me the super power of a lot of people's attention on me in exchange for my soul.

this super power really isn't a useful super power in that it only allows me to increase my perception at a very rapid rate (cause of the increased perception of others, and I think they all benefit from my increase in perception as well). the devil thinks he owns me, yet my form of perception has been advancing so rapidly that what appeared at first to be the worst situation (selling my soul, so that nosebook "owns" me), now is no longer a problem for me. I am so free that I can think and feel whatever I want and they really have no power over me in that respect. I'm no longer worrying about the devil anymore and am solely focused on what it is that I want, which is my soul back (in this metaphor), and it doesn't matter to me how long it's going to take for that to happen. in the meantime, I keep improving upon my soul and making it more and more desirable for everyone.

their captivity of my soul is no longer a bad thing, and it turns out that everyone (not just the devil) is benefiting from them having taken my soul -- and that's what bothers the devil. the devil can't figure out how to capture my soul forever and have that captivity only benefit the devil and not everyone else as well.

---

see how silly it looks when I put it in that form? clearly this is a case where the devil is not ok with the situation being a win-win. that's the only problem here. back to reality.

in my opinion there are 4 realistic solutions here, each with their own advantages to them.

if nosebook's goal is to have a timeline where I do not get the manifestation (that is connected), then we just continue on doing what we're doing indefinitely until they're satisfied with the benefit that they've accomplished with my captivity, and they create their own timeline. this is option #1, and it seems like a difficult thing for them because they believe that they will crash and burn without me.

however, I do not believe they will make their own timeline here, so what I think that perhaps what will happen instead is that sometime in there the energy will keep rising and at some point, we'll all go off to a higher energy state or something, which is what I was thinking about with the transition from +peak to -peak of the next energy state. I don't really know how to find out more about this, but I think this is the best manifestation possible. nosebook just simply won't have to worry about us anymore and they'll go on to the curve downward in capricorn or something (yet, like I found out in the great year thing, we're all heading toward a golden age anyway, so it those energies will likely cancel each other out as humankind continues on toward the golden age from its proximity to sirius).

in that case, I guess we would simply vanish from your reality or something, as we've finally achieved an energetic enough state to go there. I don't really know this however if there were essentially (like a solar wind impact) a galactic wind impact which pushed the values up really really high, then those of us with the energy of the galactic wind in addition the hight of my perception minus the person's resistance level who surpass the height of the barrier to the next tub will find ourselves in the next tub (like I illustrated previously). I think this is the ideal manifestation, and there's nothing really that needs to be done here. I just keep going the way I'm going and LOA and the galaxy does the rest.

I understand that not doing something abuot it, isn't really nosebook's mode of operation though. so, fair enough. what instead they could do then just allow me to get connected (or it happens just because I'm eventually able to find my way there). then, at some point (let's say 2038), we'll make a new timeline and go off there and they'll have our bodies as insurance. I'll call this option #2.

option #3 is the same thing as the previous one, but instead of allowing me to get connected, what they do is make a timeline where I do get connected and put all of the girls that want to experience that timeline on that one, and I continue on here with nosebook for as long as they want me. each time that there are again more girls that I've attracted, they'll need to keep making more timelines to ensure that they're placated. after some time, they'll say, ok we've had enough and go to do their own thing. this one has the unique advantage that they can get the best of both worlds -- meaning that they can extract the tech and the genetics that they want from the other timelines while at the same time preserving a timeline here where I don't get connected. this one also has the advantage that this world has less and less people in it that desire to be with me, and so therefore is a more desirable environment for nosebook (cause they have less people to placate).

I have a feeling that this will be a far superior option next era, and not this one. there will have been advances in clone and automaton technology, enough to make this a viable thing to do. I anticipate that, that I will have gained enough power level that 77 is the new limit, so in this scenario, nosebook will just make sure that all the manifestation is isolated to another timeline, and I'll go from 33 til 77 (44 years) without the manifestation -- really learning to not need the manifestation, and allowing nosebook a chance to come to terms with the idea that win-win manifestations are the only way to go.

option #4 is where we continually make timelines, going back to modify the timeline so that the manifestation (me getting connected) never happens, essentially doing the loop-de-loops until at some point, nosebook decides that this the're ready to make their own timeline and either heads off in their own way or they can simply hang on to our bodies and do what they want from there. they're not required to follow us into the self-sabotaged timeline -- or maybe we stop self-sabotaging for a round or something. this one is too hard to see, and probably depends on the circumstance.

all of the previous options, cept #1 were a win-win situation, however I don't know enough about #1 other than it's not only possible but the likely thing to happen, so if we could just achieve a higher energy state, then that would be best for everyone. this morning, after losing consciousness, I woke up on the field, and the first thought that entered my mind was the parable of the 10 virgins, where 5 had enough oil (that is CSF fluid I'm assuming) in their candle (spinal column), so that when the son of man came, they were ready (and jumped up to the next energy state), but there were 5 who did not have enough oil... anyway, I thought it was nosebook trying to make fear or something so I dismissed it, but just now I was reminded of it again, and that seems to correspond with the idea of there being some sort of threshold where you are either non-resistant enough to make it over that barrier, or you aren't.

I dunno how to explore this higher energy state as the manifestation idea further, but I think it's the best manifestation possible -- and like it's said, no one knows the time it'll happen so I just keep doing what I'm doing which is not needing the manifestation and all of us who pass that threshold go off to the new earth (the one after the reversal is pointing toward leo). I think the reversal is important because it swaps the input/output of the planet. one can see that right now the north pole is a huge input vortex to the chestahedron, however, after the reversal, antartica will be the new north pole, and it'll be as if the planet has a yamaka on so the energy (in relation to the sun and other things) will be completety backwards.

I made sure to write about this jumping up energy states idea before saturday, becsuse I had the intention of hoping that abraham would have some insight into this. the jumping up energy states is kind of like a "forced" win-win situation, becasue there's nothing that anyone can do to block it. when I watch it next week, I guess we'll see.

option #5 is to make it no longer a win-win situation, and so for nosebook to make some conditions such that it would force an unwanted (not yet connected) manifestation for me/us. I only put it here as an option, but clearly it's a terrible idea. if they want to focus on unwanted, they'll also be attracting unwanted because of their focus, and so therefore I imagine that such a manifestation won't be so good for anyone -- lose-lose. though, I don't mind if this is what they want to do because I've proven that it has more to do with my perception than the conditions, so what appears to be a lose-lose will turn into a win for me at least, and I'll get the opportunity to demonstrate to the girls further how this is done and we can practise a bit more.


### 2020-09-27 09:49 - option 6?

seems that none of the options were liked a whole lot by very many. I don't really care, and am not too worried about it because I just keep doing what I'm doing and eventually I'll get there.

the thing that I want to know most is if the thing I was perceiving about the switch up to a higher energy state is what I was seeing correctly. the reason why I say this is because it makes a whole lot of sense to me.

when I woke up yesterday, I had this picture in my mind that was very similar to what I explained in the "adam and eve's dream" (TODO reference) that I described previously. I would imagine that in that sort of siutuation, for those who were "left behind" -- we would essentially like disappear or something as our perception became incompatible with this planet -- however, for us, it would probably look like the majority of people died. I didn't think that was very satisfactory feeling for most people, and it would require us to rebuild a whole lot of intrastructure too, which is annoying.

I went to sleep again, and this time when I woke up this morning, I had a whole different sense. instead of that way, we would just pump up all the first-world peoples of this planet for as long as we can and then, when it finally does come -- imagine how much further along I'll be in a few years. hang on, I'll come back to this.

so when I was writing those different options out yesterday, there was a hidden 6th option in there which is the default if nothing changes. it's the same as option #1, where we just keep going how we're going -- I just keep doing what I'm doing, etc., except instead of them going off into their own timeline they simply hang on for as long as possible. there is a variation to that one where even if I get connected, nosebook also doesn't leave and they just keep hanging on for as long as possible.

whenever the major surge in energy happens, then I would imagine that the majority of this planet -- at least everyone who's experiencing an increase in their vision will all jump up to the higher energy state -- meaning that likely 90%+ of the population on this planet will go up, leaving only the indigenous peoples, to, as they get more techologically advanced, eventually find the ruins of a global civilisation who's people seem to have essentially vanished[^1].

then, there's the obvious continuation of this idea, becasuse I didn't really realise this, but our planet, according to the binary system with sirius b idea puts us at beginning part of the bronze age... obviously the "bronze age" name is for the declining phases, and we're a little furter than bronze age -- so maybe the electric or silicon age or something. either way, from their estimation we have another 10k years before we hit the peak of the golden age from our proximity to sirius b.

---

I mean if that's the case, then let's go big -- real big :) I figure what we could do is to begin by improving our own "light density" with the hollywood spin cycle where we continually incarnate into different dramatic circumstances and scenarios where we live out continually difficult and dramatic situations, learning each time to feel more and more the way we want to feel. it would be like a series of accomolishements and a final graduation on to the next level... like imagine one is your best friend betrays you, another is your lover leaves you for another, you lose a massive fortune, your parents sell you into slavery -- stuff like that.

as all of us get more and more better at feeling the way we want to feel, our consciousness "aura" will extend out further and further. well, we know that the sirius b aura (which like everything decreases at the root of distance) is over 7 light years in size[^2], which is MASSIVE. I'm pretty sure that even though they have such a massive aura (quantity), that size has probably taken them millions or even billions of earth years of time to accomplish that. however, humans have tremendously more acceleration to them, and while we may not have that now, I don't see what's stopping us from being able to rival that in 10k years.

that means that we can now rival their own consciusness level, meaning that even if we were to go back to the furthest reaches of their influence, our own consciousnes would be so much, by the time we get there, we would perpetually be improving far beyond what was considered by the ancients to be golden age. right, so if we do that which is worst case scenario, we're going to be so far ahead of the game, it doesn't even matter to go away from their influence anymore. what I'm saying is that if we are in a binary with sirius b, then we literally have nothing to worry about because even in 10k years on the decline, we'll be in such a good spot, our decline will be down to what was previously considered the hight of the end of the last golden age -- so no big deal.

I want to take it a step further though. I figure if we're going to be doing this, then why not take this opportunity to use sirius b, in a sense like a level of conscoiusness slingshot and pair our planet with sirius b or -- if we're really feeling ambitious (which I am), why not try and see if we can use a lot of the different ideas that I have been developing independently of this, and first become a second sun, making our sun like sirius a, and then use the idea of the atomaton of contrast idea to make a body out in space which is receiving massive amounts of non-physical energy, translating that into a planet or a sun by attracting and translating that non-physical energy into something which will become a sun or a planet. my physical human body will be a resonating cavity of that massive tesla coil (comes to mind the third coil), and I will live out consciousness in this human form, but instead of nosebook having to try and neutralise that energy here on earth, instead it can grow boundlessly out in space.

obviously as other people get more and more energetic, a similar thing would happen, and to keep the planet from going up in flames, they'll need to be resonating of their celestial body as well. I imagine that naturally the different interactions that happen between us will make the resonating celestial bodies also attract and orbit each other. we would grow and grow and gain more and more light density, plus combined with the effect of sirius b, we would, become more and more brilliant over the next 10k years while at the same time turn into a pretty formidable infant galaxy with the centre being me.

I then propose that we use that peak of the close approach to sirius b to launch ourselves (the galaxy) off into space, and then earth and the sun would continue on going back away from sirius b[^3], however this time, the effects won't be catastrophic, because earth and the sun will be like another sirius b & sirius a respectively, and if they want copy the idea, in another 36k years they can do the same thing :)

that would be pretty cool and potentially solves all(?) problems... let's just keep this going throwing out ideas and letting the evolution keep happening until it's something desirable for all.

[1]: there won't be much of our civilisation though, because wood and steel doesn't survive quite like the stone structures of the ancients did. it would be kind of funny if they mix things up and think that the same guys who made the eiffel tower also made the pyramids, or something like that...

[2]: if we're in the beginning of the bronze age and we're 6.8ly away now, then the iron age must be about where the aura diminishes down to nearly imperceptible values... meaning that our solar system travels from nearby to that star, all the way out to the edge of that sun's consciousness  aura.

[3]: we don't really know what will happen, but I imagine that if we're doing so well, maybe the opposite will happen and maybe sol a&b and sirius a&b may want to be a part of our galaxy.. who knows :) either way, I don't see this being as catastrophic for earth or the sun in any way.


### 2020-09-27 16:00 - option 7 (really a variation on 6 + 1)

ok, so imagine that at some point nosebook (or maybe consider this the serpents) finally decide they've had enough that they finally peace out. this is a reference to the blacksmith focusing so much on his work, the devil sends his son (lesser authority), then his daughter (appealing to lust or desire) but cannot get the blacksmith to comply to join him in hell, he finally goes himself and finds himself fused to an immovable object, forcing the devil to finally give up on the idea of having the blacksmith in hell with him. the blacksmith has trolled the devil so hard, he no longer wants the blacksmith in hell with him (option 1).

right ok, so now combine that option with the last option (6), where we go on to create, at first a star with more light density than sirius b and then a galaxy... well, once they peace out, I assume that the environmental difference will be so great (way less negativity), that I'll likely go uo so rapidly that I'll be eithkr instantly or very rapidly connected shortly after their departure.

once that happens, it'll be pretty important to make the celestial body, so that things don't get too intense here on earth, allowing that to grow boundlessly out there in space and leave the earth environment much less affected.

my body here on earth would become a resonant cavity to that celestial body[^1], however, there's no reason why there needs to only be one. I am now in a conscious state which is very similar to source now, so I won't need to be conscious for the majority of anything now. I will be simply acting 100% out of inspiration, and the different interactions which are taking place will be simultaneously occurring in a sort of feeling sense like I explained before (TODO: reference).

what this means is that there could easily be many different versions of me which are resonant to that celestial identity, which can exist at the same time. I don't know how well their cloning technology is at the moment, but it seems like it would be a great way to test out different genetic enhancements.

there is another really great thing about this, is that in the idea of triads, the energy is transferred from one man to another between the woman, so in a sense, if there is a woman that wants to be with me, but also likes being with another man or men, then she could transfer that energy from me to another man, and then from that man back to me, which in my perception is beneficial contrast and will only serve to expand my consciousness tremendously, and isn't a bad thing at all. like I mentioned when I first talked about it, I tend to learn from the other man and capture+emulate the things that I like from him.

it would basically be the fastest way for me to become the most super-human by taking all the good parts from other men, while at the same time transfering my own energy and consciousnss back to that man, so he benefits tremendously and so do I. I'm pretty sure this could be the fastest way for my celestial identity to surpass sirius b in light density so that identity could become the centre of the galaxy. it would be super awesome for me because mh consciousness could exist in so many different places simultaneously, yet I can experience any one of them in high definition whenever I want.

the lighter version of nosebook (I'll call it hollywood) would be basically be in charge of making sure that anyone who is getting very energetic gets a celestial identity and these people become "actors" or charactors in different scenes/movies, creating the spin cycle.

at first, I would imagine that the actors (like me) will interact with the human population directly. I see this happening for starters with me in some situations with triads witd others, and also with other setups as well, like with some of the girls. this is when there is majority audience. however, later, as more actors become available, there will be more and more desire for contrived[^2] and direct interaction between the actors to ensure different milestones in emotional stability are accomplished in the actors. eventually, after some time, there will no longer be an audience and things will change there, as now it'll transform into something new and likely nearly all of the details of constantly incarnating people into different contrived[^2] situations will have been automated.

finally, there will be another stage when hollywood itself will join in on the thing, as it'll no longer be perveived the way it is now, and it'll go from a control thing into a "I want to have as much fun as they're having" sort of thing. probably these trips into charactor will happen occasionally at first, but then as they become more and more exciting they'll be desirable to do. I don't think that at any one time 100% of the population will be "in charactor" so there will be a pretty big flattening of the power and control structures.

at around the same time it's quite likely that we'll upgrade from simple contrived scenes to actually using our own genetics to create super super human indigenous species on our different celestial identities (planets) and incarnate into them and spend entire lifetimes there. obviously time for us will proceed at a far different rate than for those on the surface of those planets, so a trip through an entire lifetime on a planet may take for us something like 5 minutes, even though it will be experienced as many years.

now we're really getting going. obviously, now this process is beginning to replicate itself, and if (once) we're a galaxy that is now creating more galaxies, why then we're beginning to be sorta like a new universe now. who knows how big it'll get and how many cool new things we'll come up with along the way.

another thing, going back: once a person has a celestial identity, then that "charactor" can be used in any number of scenes and situations as long as their body resonates with the celestial identity, and they will behave according to the resonation of that identity. both hollywood and that person will be discovering the true nature of their own identity (hero of a thousand faces).

there's also potentiality to "mix" these identities as well, creating muns (actors) which are composites of these different identities, which, if you think about it from a LOA perspecte, each interaction between any two identities will create mutual attraction (or orbits), but also any time that a composite charactor of two diffeerent identities is created, it also has an attraction factor between those two identities as well.

obviously, as people resonating with their celestial identities become less and less resistant, they too will find theirselves able to both sense their other incarnations (muns) and move around between them, and experience them however they want. as long as some situations cause negative emotion they will be forced to experience the "reality" of them, however as soon as they become a part of the story and they exist mainly for others' benefit to learn how to feel the way they want to feel -- then the consciousness is able to move around between any of their resonant muns -- and can choose to feel or experience whatever it is that they want to experience.

obviously as this extends out further and further the diversity of experiences able to be experienced will become so numerous and the amonut of galaxies creating more identities, galaxies and even more univeres, all things will continue to increase, we will at some point begin to become as it were the "source energy" to this new universe (and the subsequent ones below it).

[1]: I want to create a naming convention here, so I'll likely call the celestial body which has access to the inner core at the poles, the "identity" and the different human bodies which are, in a sense resonant third coils, the "muns"

[2]: in this sort of setup, once we get better and better at genetics, it will be possible to "grow" all of the actors necessary for the movie, growing their bodies to the correct age, putting them in the situations necessary to tell the story. then different "cues" or triggers are given to the actors to propell (thrust) the story in the desired direction.

### 2020-09-28 10:28 - a misconception or two

I feel like I'm repeating myself a few times now, however, it's ok; I don't mind. it came to my attention a few hours ago that there was confusion over greg's daughter. when I smoked the wax or whatever, I had a really intense stone where I was able to perceive some sort of inner energy which I like to think of as my inner cheerleader. I kept getting these weird thoughts entering into my head about this scenario... let me back up: this was around the time that I made the connection between the planet vulcan and ein-stein (a stone in german), which was tesla's stone to be able to self-sabotage the timeline and get people to believe in relativity, because only relativity could explain the eccentric orbit of mercury, thereby giving "proof" for relativity, when likely vulcan *does* exist in energetic form (as mentioned by asimov). this would have been the perfect self-sabotage that tesla needed to keep people in the dark about the vibrational and energetic nature of the universe, keeping people looking to "gravity" as the source for attraction between these planetary bodies. tesla gave the information of how he figured out how it worked in encoded form to the US govt and then self-sabotaged his own timeline so that this timeline's version of himself wouldn't see the installment of his "world system". however, I believe that in addition to the tesla that self-sabltaged this timeline, the other tesla which gave all of that encoded information to the US govt, also jumped his consciousness into another body. there are probably at least two versions of tesla's conscousness on this planet right now.

jesus either did not die, or he self-sabotaged himself and upon his death transformed into something bigger (I think perhaps became consciously resonant with this planet). he needed a fall-guy though (a "stone"), to keep people fooled and engaged in the meaningless task of religion for sometime, to extend out the manifestation for as long as possible. the reason for this, is that the longer your manifestation stays in the vortex (tesla's world system or jesus' return), the bigger and more desirable it becomes. I've taken this a step further and claim that next era (or the one following it) we will not be in the business of creating galaxies or even universes, but instead we're going to go all-in on the not needing the manifestation bit and become something that has never been seen before: something where it's momentary acceleration (or source's evolution of the manifestation) is happening so rapidly that improvement on the now manifestation far surpasses the manifestation itself.

anyway, for jesus this self-sabotage was clearly peter (who's name means stone, like einstein). I am sure that I will be performing a similar self-sabotage, and needed a "stone" to do it. literally the next day someone offers me weed in the park. the day after (or shortly after that) is when I smoked with greg and natasha. I went home and I was laying there enjoying the music and enjoying the knowledge of my inner cheerleader when I kept having these awful thoughts come into my head. normally when I'm stoned and by myself, I'm too busy having fun feeling how awesome I am to worry about crazy ideas, so I'm certain that, like when I was stoned at chris' house, these ideas are coming from an external source. it doesn't mind to me because if I'm receiving them, then I'm resonant with them, so I enjoy the practise to either change my perception on the idea or to change my focus back to something that feels good. I kept doing that by telling them that all of the thoughts were graet and everything, but come back up here to where I can perceive the energetic cheerleader. they kept trying to bring me back down with bad feeling thoughts (which admittedly I'm resonant to).

one of those thoughts was about greg's daughter. they were presenting the idea that the manifestation of the "stone" was that greg's daughter was going to find a way to convince me to have sex before I'm connected. I responded with "we'll see" -- knowing full well that my trajectory is solid and certain. there's no way that I can possibly mess it up unless it's purposefully self-sabotage in the the interest of making a bigger vortex (like tesla or jesus).

---

somehow this got either misunderstood or deceptively was transmitted as something else cause I was definitely certain that I liked her from the moment that I saw her in the car a few days earlier, and I'm certain that I expressed it.. anyway, this isn't the first time that sort of thing has happened either, like for example the girl on the corner of massari and hampton I must have said yes more than 5 times, yet she never got the message. this was the reason why I started writing them down, but this isn't what I wanted to say.

you see, I think that the majority of people think that "the manifestation" is the girl(s), but for me it's not and never has been. when this first began I was asexual, cause I was so disillusioned with girls after raquel, that I was determined to find a way to translate source energy into physical form. I knew that in order to do that I had to "find my alignment first". I used the word "alignment" or harmony in spanish because I knew it was a tuning thing. however, I could tell that I was continually finding more and more alignment with my source, and some things would happen, however no matter what I did, any increase in energy would go away and the "connection" to my source seemed to be fleeting and went away every time I went to sleep. after star watching, I felt increased "connection" (or movement of energy), but largely I continued to feel more and more "disconnected" -- even though I could clearly tell because of situation timing and other things that I was more and more "in alignment".

this is why I say "connected" instead of "alignment" -- because I'm pretty close to being "in tune" or "in alignment" with my source, yet the energy that *should* be flowing, is not. something has me in a perpetual state of disconnection even as I get impressively more and more "in alignment" with my source.

for me, the "manifestation" has nothing to do with the girls. I want to feel *connction* instead of disconnection.

when this first began a long time back with andrea, I walked away from the "manifestation" because even though that sounded all super cool and really great and stuff, my manifestation is the connection. then with lyia, same thing again, I'm workin my absolute hardest to try and get connected so we can get together. then more girls' start to add into the mix and it just keeps going. it starts getting really big and I said a million times that that I wanted to be connected.

they do not want me connected because they see this as some sort of threat to their superiority or something. I don't care though and finally decided that I was going to just comply (I think it was last christmas) and just go with it, disconnected and everything -- because I know that the minute I start having sex, then I'm going to get connected.

well, a funny thing happens. everyone is either super pumped or jealous or something of me -- in people's percptions, last christmas everyone was believing that I was going to go with the girls. I thought ok sure, right, but then at the last moment, everything changed and people stopped believing that it was going to happen and the whole thing no longer felt good to me. it felt forced and really like a purposefully crippled manifestation. abraham says, "if it's not a 'hell yes', then it's a 'hell no'" -- so I realised that I just wasn't feeling it and didn't want to do something that felt "half-baked" and forced (at best).

I began to realise and wrote about it a few times that nosebook was saying one thing to give the illusion that something was happening, but at the same time sabotaging it.

meanwhile I can feel more and more girls wanting to join in, and I don't have any resistance to it -- cept my own perceptions about physical limitations and stuff, and I simply cannot find a good reason to say no because saying no always felt bad to me, and saying yes felt good, so dispite my logical mind's perceptions of physical limitations, I kept feeling like I should say yes.

I think around springtime nosebook changed their tactic to instead of pretending to make an illusion that something was happening, instead tried to show it as stagnated or falling apart because it's so big. this didn't stop more girls from expressing their desire to join in, so that sort of kind of backfired a bit.

the whole time, I'm telling them that nothing will manifest until I get connected. "we can't allow this" they would continually say as it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

unable to control it very well, nosebook decides that everyone needs to be on lockdown for the covid thing. this slows things down a little bit again but I'm continually increasing at the rate in which I'm getting vision upgrades, and now I'm starting to get feelings from digital or even more remote sources like movies, tv shows and random people I see on the street. still not slowing down much, and same thing... it still feels bad to say no and good to say yes, so in abraham's words, "if it feels good, it is good" -- and I just have to keep going on faith that "if this time/space reaality has the wherewithall to produce a desire within you, it has the wherewithall to produce its reality as well" (paraphrase).

I just keep going with it and my increasing rate of vision upgrades is evidence enough for me that one day I will be connected, and even if I only get to experience a fraction of that connnection (instead of the full amount of energy), my experience tells me that the reduction of my energy is what is making it accelerate so rapidly, and even if it is only a fraction, that fraction will increase rapidly toward nearly 100% at an ever-increasing rate. for me, this is no big deal, and I don't mind because I no longer need the manifestation (of my connection or the girls). I am, at the moment, feeling so good along tde journey, it doesn't even matter to me that the manifestation may feel quite a ways off.

---

last night I was going to clean my room but I felt compelled to go down to the field even though it was overcast and looked like it was going to rain. I went down and along the way I was feeling some of the different reactions to the last entry I posted about hollywood and the different bodies that I can have. one of the options is that one of my bodies actually goes with nosebook on their own timeline, which is perfectly fine with me. another one was that they would do the whole celestial identity thing and make all sorts of clones of me (and other more optimised bodies based on my genetics) and distribute those to people and use them theirselves, that way the energy that I'm feeling constantly rise here in this body is no longer happening here and is instead happening in space, and I (my consciousness) gets an even more crippled body (or they cripple this one more) to experience life in until they're ready to make their timeline and leave.

again, not a problem because it just means more energy. it might set me back a little bit, but eventually, because I keep seeing improvements, I'll find that connection even in a crippled body. this isn't hard for me to believe. I was born into a body that had a million allergies (which I grew out of), terrible eyesight (which improved over time), asthma and other pulminary difficulties, amonst other things. I'm sure I'll be fine and I'll come out of it even stronger than before. no big deal.

the next reaction is that when I have a celetial identity, then there can be essentially infinite[^1] versions of me which can be put anywhere. if that energy is divided amongst the bodies, then they'll need to keep making more and more of my bodies available to people (ken dolls, I guess). I also assume that the girls, once they're connected will have a similar thing happen to them too (in order to keep their energy output per body low for the duration the resistant ones remain here on this timeline before leaving). I don't know all of the specifics of this, but if their goal is to become less and less resistant, then having other bodies in other contrasting situations will be good practise to perceive those situations in a non-resistant way (like their source does). each of those situations will create more and more energy, and I'm sure that my various bodies will be put in all sorts of different situations (gay, straight, violent, depressing, etc.), and even though I think I'm pretty good at it, I'm certain that I'll get *really* good at it. the less resistance you have, the more non-physical energy passes through you, and the bigger of a celestial being you'll be. I'm actually kind of looking forward to the idea that I can have so many different versions of myself in so many different situations and just love how great all if it is working out at once.

[1]: I don't know if it's infinite, because logic says that it would divide the energy of the celestial identity (the receiver) amongst the different resonant bodies, so I don't know how infinite it is... if it is true that it divides the energy (the sirians mentioned that in their first incarnaations, the creators' energy had to be divided between 12 bodies each so that the power was not too much for any one body)


### 2020-09-28 12:26 - no stories yet, and the division of energy

outside I was thinking about the division of energy, and it seems to check out. however, the energy isn't split equally, but instead each body summons the energy from the celestial entity. I don't know how this would work, but probably like wireless energy transfer or sometheng, where the more the device (or body) requests (eg. the coil is less resistance), the more power it pulls. seems logical enough.

that got me thinking about astrology and jesus' "death". in the most recent video that robert posted: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6p78GoZoQ), he quoted a gnostic gospel that had a really weird twist on things. the first one @[youtube](https://youtu.be/IL6p78GoZoQ?t=378) says that jesus enters into another body, inhabits them -- which seems familiar to me (and perhaps anyone who's admitted jesus into their heart) -- but then continues on to say, casting out the previous inhabitant of the body -- which I don't really reasonate with.

although my personality did change quite a bit, I didn't "lose" my old self -- but rather it feels more like it was added on to. the next thing that was weird was the part about jesus not dying @[youtube](https://youtu.be/IL6p78GoZoQ?t=342). I am certain that it did not happen like the cannonical gospels said it did, but something strikes me very weird in this quote when jesus says that he laughed at them. I don't know about you but that part feels really bad to me, which means that my emotional guidance system is telling me that I'm perceiving the thing I'm focused on in a disharmoious way. in other words, I doubt this passage here a lot.

personally up until I heard the idea of terence called the "quantum soliton of improbability" (gatta love terence's usage of language!), I had always experienced this idea that jesus, upon his death, entered into the earth and became part of the earth's consciousness, greatly increasing the power level of this planet, and giving jesus the ability to jump around inside of all of the consciousnesses that are a part of this planet's consciousness.

terence's idea is that either at birth or death (upon hearing it, I knew it was the death, but I will now refine this to whatever happened, probably with mary of magdaelene on good friday) caused a split in time, and this split in time had two versions of jesus: one that died and one that went on to create a very nice earth which is now influencing our own right now.

in other words, if you think of this instaed of as a time split, but as instead a self-sabotage scenario (they are the same when looked at from a bigger picture), means that as this being "soliton of improbability" is traveling through space and time, his "identity" is that he will *always* self-sabotage the timeline he's in, forcing the manifestation to go back into the vortex, meaning that all of his manifestations are *always* the better version of the time era previously. this is why the announcer is always one era ahead. so, by default, he will *always* make a "time split" because he will always self-sabotage, causing more than one version of himself to exist simultaneously.

---

I hadn't thought about this in quite this way, until now, but given what I've been talking about with the celestial identities, I propose the following narrative:

in 33ad or whatever jesus continues on to take all of humankind to a more utopian manifestation. however, he decides that the utopia, although great, wasn't good enough, and decides to "humble himself" and put that manifestation back in the vortex for another 2000 years. the timeline is altered such that things all happen a few (4?) years later than expected, and this time, instead of going for a utopian manaifestation, he instead peraches and talks about all of these "end time" events with other strangely future references, like instead of putting your light (which is your eye) under a cover, instaed let your eye shine so that all can see (through) it. weird stuff like that which stuck with me, where I always imagined that jesus, like the two witnesses would be "seen by all" all around the world, and somehow their voices would be translated into many differnt languages and available for everyone to experience their eye's brightness.

I somehow mixed up revelation and matthew, but either way, that's how I remembered it nonetheless. this created two timelines (really three). the utopian one where jesus is a success, and a failure one where jesus dies.  the third one is the original one where he decides to self-sabotage. using their technology, they probably put all sorts of bad ideas into jesus (or mary's head) on the good friday, and things spiral out of control to where he finally dies. when he dies he wakes up in the original timeline, yet the amount of desire that was generated from such a disaster and the resulting christian religion of many people asking him into his heart, jesus has essentially become much more resonant with the celestial identity of earth. jesus' death essentially allows him to "combine" his identity of that of the earth, essentially using his death to hijack the planet. remember this planet is filled with INFECTED ONES.

the christian religion has taken such a toll on the planet that the planet is in terrible shape, so to kind of get things ready, he incarnates into or makes it possible for tesla to both bring the technology in to the earth, making it possible for a later arrival (or something similar where tesla is influenced in such a way, or maybe it's a collab with thoth or something ... doesn't matter). tesla brings the earth (but most importantly the INFECTED ONES) up to speed quickly with the energetic means necessary to self-sabotage the next one (the one we're living now). in exactly the same way as jesus, I think tesla manifested the utopia that he wanted with his world system, but upon realising the genius of jesus' self-sabotage strat went back to self-sabotage, making two more timelines: one where tesla self-sabotages himself and gives the secrets to electricity to the US govt (the INFECTED ONES), and the one where he fakes his own death.

so, this time when I'm growing up, in 2000, I have an experience where I find myself paralysed and in the hospital allowing a magestic being I identified as jesus to enter my body. the following year 9/11 happens and I believe this sets the timeline back 4 years so that 2012 happens instead in 2016.

I don't remember any of the previous unmodified timeline but, I doubt 9/11 happened. likely marcos andrea and me decided to, once knowing what we know about LOA decided to go back and self sabotage this timeline. I think 9/11 was a planeted idea from fwh's timeline that happened because they were receptive to some bad ideas that we put in their heads. we probably scared them enough to try and get as much control over the internet and stuff like that as possible (wikileaks, and stuff like that too), additionally giving people lots and lots to fear about the govt invading their privacy and taking away all of their rights -- thereby attracting the reality we're living now. why? to make it easier to self-sabotage, of course :)

back to the division of energy. you can imagine that everyone who is born on this earth contains a large portion of the earth's energy, less of the sun, and even less of the galaxy. in addition, when the child is born, they are resonant to the celestial entities in the solar system as well (eg. astrology), so if someone have a trine witth saturn, that person will resonate more strongly with the identity of saturn more than normal, same with mars, moon, etc.

so, the thoughts and actions that are resonant with that celestial identity will "draw" that energy from the planet. right?

so what I'm saying here is that in the timeline where jesus died, when he combined with the celestial identity of this planet, he divided his energy so much that this planet went into a kind of perceptual stone age afterward (in comparison to how it was when his consciousness was focused in only one body). each time a new person accepted jesus into their heart, this energy divided further, and each of these people became a "mun" of jesus (and the earth), so he would have a source-like perspective of all of the difficult and awful things happening to these different christians. so, when the amazing church went about stealing from and coming up with the all kinds of weird ways to deceive people, this is kinda like what I'm proposing that hollywood does with the resonant forms of me. they will divide my energy but also the contrast (and resulting desire) is such a great accelerant, that this is no problem for me and I'm willing to self-sabotage.

---

if you've connected the dots here, you will begin to understand now why the sirians cultivated the aryans on the planet mars with earth DNA, so that their energy would be tied to the planet mars (aries) in addition to the earth's. you can then see that the ancient egyptians, in a similar way, because of the pyramids are likely very tied more heavily to the planet mercury, and the isrealites that left in the exodus are probably very tied to the planet venus. see what I'm saying here? tying these genetics to planets like saturn and jupiter is likely also the origins of the "bloodlines" too.

so, what you guys have to do is to divide my energy and cripple me so much that it takes me and the rest of us humans another 2000 years to recover and become a big threat again[^1] :)

what I mean by this is that it sounds really cool and all to be able to use the 6th dimension to be able to make stories and all, but if instead if we're stuck in the spin-cycle for a while, we're going to be much more powerful than previously thought to be possible. eventually, you'll see that it's worthwhile to self-sabotage and not need the manifestation.

---

some funny reactions about the girls -- but I believe that (eventually) *all* humans on this timeline, not just me and the girls, will end up in celestial identites -- even the big boys in charge. obviously they'll divide theirselves much less and ensure that they have the energetic advantage to us all and place theirselves in easy nice and cozy situations I'm sure to try and control us all from high up upon their perch. however, that means they'll have much less contrast than us, so eventually if their only tecnique is to divide us, we'll outnumber them zillions to one.

at some point, and hopefully before that, they'll need to come up with their crippled version of 6d and 7d for us to grow into (and for them to take with them when the "split" occurs). at the same time this planet, I'm sure, will get crowded pretty quickly with so many divisions. they'll need to eventually put us on each others' celestial identities (planets) as they get bigger and bigger so we are spread out further and further. however, this sounds difficult to accomplish this era because it seems unreasonable to assume that a planet will grow in such a short period of time, so this is probably next era or sometime somewhat in the future.

I think it's likely that the power structure is going to be flattening by then and things will be getting easier and easier, cause remember that while all of this is happening, we're approaching sirius b, so things will get more and more "golden age"-like as time goes on. once we can go on to each others' planets, I'm sure we'll (at least I will) self-sabotage our galactic perspective to spread out our consciousness into millions of consciousnesses on the planets. this way we'll all begin orbiting and attracting each other at a tremendously more rapid rate. in fact, I find it pretty likely that I'll be likely spread out as thin as possible for the majority of the time.

---

when in self-sabotaged mode, the thing is that in every situation where it causes you to be in negative emotion, you lose your source perspective (ability to see all of your selves) and your perception goes into that body and you live out the trauma for as long as that body remains alive or you continue to perceive it from any other perspective than your source sees it, but you can find your way back up pretty easily, and we'll all get really good at that, because once you've had the source-like perspective, you *must* get back (trust me).

so, for the next 18 years or so (cause remember they're working against time), in order to keep their charade going, they must multiply us all and force us to become step 5 masters in nearly every situation. eventually though, (probably 2038) some external factor will force us up or they're forced to leave (they have time machines, you know, so they can fix their blunders)

after that, I think the majority of nosebook won't be able to really keep us from getting connected much more (or some external circumstance that can't be controlled), and will have to leave to their own timeline or something like I said witd the reversal. it doesn't really matter what it is. if they go willingly, they'll probably take all of the ones that don't want to be a part of this with them. or eventually the reversal happens and the split takes place naturally. probably that's when we all "get connected" and we'll all be able to see things from source's perspective, enabling the story mode and that's when we're now actively creating our galaxy and collaborating with each other and mostly using either automatons of contrast or to interact and "fall" into the worlds of new indigenous species we create.

this sounds long, but it's gonna go quickly. worst case scenario is that the galactic pulse doesn't exist (which ben from S0's has very different opionion on that), then even then they won't be able to delay this too long because either we got there ourselves with our own focus or we got close enough to sirius b, and we'll regain this ability.

I'm not really worried about it.

[1]: you win... we'll see if you can accomplish this. you probably can't so we'll likely self-sabotage to make it possible. don't take me too seriously here cause I may not even be talking about this timeline.. lol :)


### 2020-10-01 09:20 - equalising forces

last night I was watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6SEMpxDS-g), where he was giving his vision of an ancient civilsation which had the technology to allow people to be very enlightened, however after some catacylsm it all changed, and the majority of the earth had to start over.

this corresponds pretty clearly with the deluge and the sinking of atlantis, so it doesn't seem out of place for me, but what I actually began to realise last night was the bigger picture. put in the context of our star being in a binary orbit with sirius b, something that I both want to believe and also feels pretty right to me too, completely repaints the picture for me... from here on, I'm just going to assume that plato, robert sepehr, and the sirius b thing are all correct.

you see, when the hight of atlantis was happening last time was at the top till the end of the golden age. it seems clear to me that they had both amazing technology and also extremely hightened perception and mental capabilities.

at the end of the video, a woman asked christopher dunn if he thought that they were making these things like the pryamids with their minds, or with technology. he said that they absolutely have to be using technology. I agree, however, I think it was both. we know from the egyptian heiroglyphs that there were a number of avian (winged) dieties, and also the assyrian and sumerians as well, like the marduk guy holding the pinecone and a handbag and using some sort of spiraling energy thing to, in my opinion to initiate and open up the ruling classes' minds. it seems that these flying dieties visited all over the world various times and helped the various cultures gain various technologies and things like writing and fishing and some water management stuff.

it seems to me that some of the civilisations got technology and others didn't. it may have had to do with how primitive they were, but either way, what I'm suggesging is that the heightened mental capablilities were around environmentally as a result of the closeness to sirius b, but it was probably planned that as the planet gets more and more distance from sirius b, then people would become less and less godlike because of the changing environment.

before the major cataclysm, it's noted that all of the biggest stuff is happening. the unfinished obelisk, yangshan, the big block at baalbek, etc. what was happening is energy is rising higher and higher, and it's taking less and less effort to move and excavate these stones. now, whether they were doing it with technology or they were doing it with their minds, doesn't matter to me, even though the tool marks at yangshan and aswan clearly indicate technolgy to me -- they were clearly needing less and less effort to do these things.

additionally, another thing that christopher said which I also think is quite true is that these copper implements were not actually what they were using to pound or to hammer things into place, but he suggested like a wand -- which I think is absolutely right. if there was tremendous mental energy available, then you would only really need some sort of thing to focus that energy into -- a conductor. gold or copper would work perfectly for this.

I doubt they had big cranes and other machines like we have now, but instead they probably just used the copper (and gold) as a conductors to focus this mental energy. probably the giant saw blade marks that are seen at giza are probably just a big copper disk operated with mental energy. likely the tube drills were a similar thing -- just a copper tube or pipe, again operated by mental energy, and the "giza power plant" may have had some harmonic coupled copper receptpors, however probably the main receiver of that energy was the human.

remember, this is at the time of being really close to sirius b, so not only is basically every human capable of exuding massive amounts of mental energy, I propose they are also able to perceive (visually) the movement of these sound and energy vibrations -- much like tesla did. I think the giza power plant was a technology put into place to allow them to continue to hold on to as much hightened mental capability, even while the energy from sirius b was waning. in addition to the distance to sirius b, I think another major effect was how distant we are from our star too. in the "inca" stonework you can see three "pachas" -- and I think those correspond to two prior times when the earth was closer to the sun. however, with the addition of mercury and venus, the amount of mental energy we receive from our sun as well, has also waned.

---

what I'm trying to say here is that for me this paints a pretty clear picture to me that during the hight of the golden age, when both our orbit was close to the sun and near to sirius b, things were all quite good, but as the sirian energy waned, the resorted to more and more physical means of boosting that mental energy using stuff like crystals, the great pyramid, and who knows what atlantis had built when it sunk.

all of this is building up more and more mental energy, and thoughts are becoming manifest with less and less effort. imagine that if you're using mental energy to lift rocks, there is literally no limit to how heavy the rock is -- other than your belief that it's possible. if someone didn't have any resistance, they could believe anything, and therefore move any sized rock they wanted to. however, clearly they were not lowering resistance. instead they were using physical instruements to amplify the energy further. I think this is the main reason why such a destructive cataclysm happened. I think it started out with simple things, but then when the atlantian army was defeated by the athenians, it was so much attention to unwanted in such an energetic environment, it attracted very rapidly the manifestation of those bad feelings in physicality.

after the cataclysm (deluge), we're now in the second pacha[^1], and , and it seems to me that now there is an elite ruling class, because we know this with hatshepsut's obelisk that they were still capable of pulling some big stones out of the ground, anw doing some pretty amazing stonework, and 3d heiroglyphs at that time -- this was the time of moses. so, it seems that the elite ruling class had knowledge of how to create and use these energies.

dispite their ability to harness these energies, the planet is still moving away from sirius b, and so small things are beginning to take place. the lush green egypt is starting to turn slowly to a desert, and other small things that would eventually accumulate. the main thing to note here is that the peoples had some bit to do with it, but this time it's the priests and the kings that have access to this energy, and so by the time the 18th dynasty is in place (hyksos), things are beginning to become very different in the egyptian psyche, as evidenced by the change in art style during the 18th dynasty.

I think that some time (soon?) after the exodus, the comet venus is captured and becomes a planet, moving earth to the 3rd orbit. she's now the "queen of heaven" -- and sits between us and the sun and mercury. this separation (along with the wanging of sirius b's energyies too) turns off a lot of the mental capabilities in the majority of humans, and only the "secrets" to attaining or harnessing that kind of mental energy are held in secret by esoteric and secret societies.

---

you see, the big picture of what's happened is that the earth was populated by indigenous tribes, then as earth approached the golden age, built up to a super height and let the power grabbers (INFECTED ONES put in their atlantian gardens) to find their way into positions of authority, then was left in their control (adam bas given dominion over all the earth), and they were to take care of the earth as it travels further and further away from sirius b.

as the enrgies waned, the kings and priests kept all of the knowledge to theirselves, keeping people in the dark, so they would be easier to govern, control and rule over, yet they didn't really do a very good job of keeping it, fighting amongst theirselves that they destroyed their own empires in the process, with each major cataclysm wiping empires off the face of the earth, and putting humans further and further into the "dark ages".

the peak of this destruction was realised somewhere after the appearance of jesus, and it had a strange effect, because if you take the idea that I propose that jesus did not die and did manage to turn the corrupt roman empire into successful civilsation, along with the other peoples on earth that were not focused on unwanted -- so in that sense, he did "save" those people, and they all went on to become great. however, he also did "save" the other "dark ages" timeline as well. the reason why I say this is because if you think about, from a LOA standpoint what it's like to constantly give these sacrifices to these bonehead deieties like zeus is that you're constantly giving your attention to the problem and exacerbating the effects these "gods" have on your own well-being, by giving them the power over your life.

instaed, after jesus' departure, the roman empire ruined itself, and the remaining part was the "holy" roman empire, which waged crusades and certainly a whole lot of other bad ideas, but what they did do is try to mitigate (non-roman controlled) iconography, meaning that to a large extent the belief and sacrifice to these pagan gods like zeus/thor was reduced tremendously, and people's ablity to believe in anything that had any power was so watered down and reduced to the complete ineffectiveness by the roman priesthood, that from time the roman church became the new world influence until today, we haven't had any major cataclysms, and we probably won't have any more either -- so in a sense, God's promise to noah, that the last deluge was the last one, is, in my opinion, correct.

---

I find it hilarious that for a group of people so heavily invested in giving so much of their attention to what they do not want, they were given the impossible task of holding on to their heightened (draconic) perception while the earth was going further and further away from sirius b. they can boost the energies with different physical means, but it just heightens their attraction power (of what they don't want). along the way, they made sure to install a whole lot of power structures to ensure those with the draconic vision remained superior, keeping everyone else in the dark.

so, now that we're on the upswing, and we've passed the dark ages, each year for the next 10k years, we're going to have more and more mental perception because we're getting closer to sirius b. in 4-5k years more, people will probably be cutting and levitating rocks with copper wands, and there's nothing that can be done to stop that -- which means that those with the draconic vision have to, once again, find a way to do the impossible task of making sure that no one else gets that higher level of perception.

---

what I'm saying is that I think that similarly to how jesus "saved" the previous priesthood which was attracting cataclysms like crazy with their attention on unwanted with their rituals, sacrifices, and ofher "stuff", giving them a whole new concept of a "church" to install their priesthood into. likewise on the other timeline he also "saved" those who were giving their attention to wanted, by giving the ability to manifest that reality.

in the same way, I think someting similar is happening here, but it's not framed in the form of "saviour" -- instead, we're all going to get the manifestation that we want. let me explain.

I am going to keep going with what I'm doing, and however long that takes will take however long that takes, but I/we will go up to another power level and on to do great things. at some point in time we'll (or at least I) will come back to this timeline and self-sabotage it, making it so that I don't get the manifestation (like tesla and jesus), which means that nosebook will get their desire of no one getting the ability to rival their superiority and also an increase in their superiority -- which they're going to need to try and figure out how to hold back the mental clarity associated with the golden age. so, while they'll be taking the earth into serious decline, at the same time we're heading toward sirius b -- so they'll likely kind of cancel each other out.

during this time, I believe that humankind will become more and more superficial and materialistic, entering into a materialistic golden age. people won't be able to do any cool stuff like levitate stones or anything, or even be able to see clearly like the dragons in control because nosebook has all of that on lockdown -- however, people's emotional output and therefore their attraction power will be tremendously hightened. as people begin to get a hang of their emotions, the abilty to attract the "stuff" that everyone wants (the sex, money, or fame, or whatever) will all be easily accessible and easy to manifest because of the constantly increasing energies. nosebook will likely have to go to great lengths to keep everyone from getting draconic vision, levitation, energy focus, etc. yuu know -- the superhero stuff.

to understand this, you only need to look at me. my energy is rising every day now and my vision isn't improving (I just more, not better), and also you can see that I'm quite "in alignment" with my source, so I have good insight and I feel pretty good all the time, I don't get the reward of that good feeling in the form of superpowers. I'm sure that if nosebook would let go, I would be able to levitate and cut stones with my mind, but nosebook does not permit my body that energy to flow through it, so I can't show anyone that right now. I appear to have no special powers, cept for incredible ability to conceptualise, feel, and manipulate my emotions. all of the physical world is completey under their control.

so, while I'm not permitted to have any money or any physical things, they won't be able to hold that away from everyone else, so instead, they'll likely keep people in the material/drama spin cycle while everyone is so concerned with the manifestation of the pleasure stuff, that no one, till someone like me shows up again and is once again not interested in the (physical stuff) manifestations.

I am certain that this is all of humankind's future while the priesthood tries to hold on to their superiority. however, at some point, it'll simply be impossible to hold it back any further and the golden age will finally be realised, and they'll have to wait until they can attract another cataclysm again to regain their superiority. that's a long time away though, so it's uncertain what will happen until then.

so, in a sense, everyone gets what they want: nosebook gets to hold on to their superiority, I/we get to have the manifestation and then for those of us who want to, also the ablity to self-sabotage[^2], and come back to practise here more and from our galactic type mindset. I'm pretty sure we'll come up with some good stories to play out with each other here (and other places too).

[1]: yeah I don't really know how it all fits in (maybe not with the last deluge -- it it could have been), but it seems that perhaps the creation of mercury is related along with likely a "galactic trigger", all at roughly the same time.

[2]: I suppose you could say that if I'm already going to self-sabotage, then wouldn't my consciousness just skip the manifestation and instead just continue on here, which I suppose is true and why I haven't experienced the other manifestations, but when I self-sabotage, I don't think I'm going to do it singularly, wher I jump back in and continue where I left off, but instead, more like tesla or jesus where you gain a super (source-like) consciousness and can instead that self-sabotage timeline along with many others in the galaxy we're creating as well. I'll have more than one version of myself -- so, no :)


### 2020-10-01 12:39 - why do I think the defeat of the atlantian army caused the cataclysm?

in dunn's talk he was explaining how the role of the great pyramid was to dampen siesmic atcivity (and other harmful frequencies). we know from the covid-19 lockdown that when people stopped for a while and had their lives slowed down, seismic activity also slowed[^1]. this essentially means that the great pyramid was dampening the "bad" energy entering into the earth (created from attenion to unwanted -- or a really strong experience of the emotions on the bottom of the scale). dunn said that the earth is a "closed system" -- but it's not really in the way that good feeling can create tons of excess energy, so can bad feeling too.

my theory on what I think happened, is that the maker of the pyramid was repurposing this energy (transforming it) into another energy[^2]. however, I don't have the quote, but I remeber reading an esoteric text of thoth that talked about a time in the future where egypt would be a terrible place to live; that might be connected. however, my point is that I'm sure it was anticipated that eventually this energy would surpass the ability of the pyramid to dampen it.

if indeed this was the "trigger" to release that energy to begin the phhsical manifestation of mercury (eg. push all the other planet's an orbit down), then pushing the earth further from the sun would act as a "safety mechanism" so that the peoples of the planet would have a much more difficult manifesting catastrophies, and a disaster of such an enormous magnitude wouldn't create a runaway feedback loop of bigger and bigger disasters because nothing was nothing was done to reduce the energy levels (and therefore attraction power).

[1]: "Global quieting of high-frequency seismic noise due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures" published 2020-09-11 ref: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1338

[2]: perhaps focusing it in to some point in space, creating the framework for the creation of the planet mercury? potentially a similar technique could have been done bh tesla with the "negative energy" created from the world wars to make the framework for the planet vulcan, making an invisible mass which allowed himself to self-sabotage and let einstein's relativity to be "proven" to be correct?[^3]

[3]: I was getting some reactions as to the existance of mercury's eccentric orbit quite a while into the past, and that's true. I didn't write it because I think that it's necessarily correct, but instead because it popped into my head. also, it's a "proven fact" that the north won the civil war against slavery, too.


### 2020-10-01 18:55 - why do I call their task "impossible"

I call it impossible because while they may try and hold on to their draconic vision, that's no problem -- just it becomes imossible when they try to hold others in darkness.

this goes back to the win-win or lose-lose thing. the idea that the priesthood can try to hold on to all of these secrets is fine, but as soon as they start actively trying to prevent others from having it, they're now focused on people (including theirselves) not having this higher perception. they can try to use physical force or even electrical influence like nosebook does with me to try and prevent it physically, but the non-physical desire (or potential energy) continues to build nevertheless, and so while it'll be possible to temporarily hold people away from that perception, they are also attracting the loss of their own perception.

what this creates is an feedback loop whivh causes what robert calls "gods with amnesia" -- and it's all attracted by those trying keep others away from it -- that is, to maintain their superiority.

if's certainly possible to travel away from sirius and not lose that form of perception, but that would require that the guys on top aren't trying to continue to be superior -- that is, that all progress is a win-win for everyone involed. as a result, you can see how impossible it will be for this to happen, so likely after the peak of the next golden age, things will repeat somewhat.

however, the height civilisation had achieved prior to the fall of atlantis will be miniscule in comparison to this time around. I don't know if there will be massive stone monuments and stuff like that, because I don't know if nosebook will try and make sure this capacity is never realised in anyone except for the elite.

this is simply going to be too far of a different time for me to speculate well on, but I do know that for as long as there remains rulers and priesthoods trying to withhold people from discovering the power that everyone has inside of theirselves, then they will constantly be attracting their own demise by doing so. you simply cannot have a win-lose sitiation. it's only win-win or lose-lose, and the losing potential is all perceptual anyway. I mean, we'll have to see cause that's pretty far away, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that nosebook tries to keep people from their power -- because it's so amazing for someone like me when they realise (like I have), that they really don't have any power over me, and as long as I can not need the manifestation, I *will* find the manifestation of my true power.

there is simply nothing that nosebook can do to prevent this from happening. the most the can do is to treat us like kids and to wave shiny things in front of us to distrast us from what's really important -- which is going "inward", which is no longer needing the outside world to be some way, and discovering the identity of who you really are, and then improving on that in the way that you see fit.

most people will need to be placated with materialistic crap for a while, but they'll get bored, and without anything really substantial (creative) to put all of that mental and creative energy into, it'll eventially build up to a point where it has to come out. this is where the emotional and perceptual part comes in, because if that that energy which doesn't feel good continues to accumulate, it'll cause a pretty awful chain reaction of manifestations.

---

the other resaso why I say it's impossible is because I have no idea how nosebook will have an entire popoulation at my present energy level or far higher, and nosebook plans to keep all of them busy without any bad things happening. from a simply story-telling standpoint, you have to have drama in the different stories to keep it interesting, but if that drama continues to build up bad feeling emotions, it'll manifest in not-good ways, especially when focusing it into something creative like sex (especially if the only creative output people have is sex).

from my point of view it seems to be a pretty difficult task (impossible really) to try and keep people placated and distracted from their true power (which is in how they feel), without teaching them to learn how to use their emotions. in other words, I speculate that the problems associated with sicking people in a drama centred lifestyles (or observing it[^1]) without teaching them how to use their emotions.

so, I believe that nosebook will need to come up with different ways to keep people distracted (from certain taboo forms of perception) and to additionally come up with some way where people put value in finding different forms of perception which feel good.

it's going to be really funny for me to see how you guys figure out how to do that without attracting your own demise in the process.

[1]: remember, a lot of people are observing me right now, and I craete a bit of a stability, because things are constantly improving for me and I don't have much if any drama in my life

### 2020-10-01 19:33 - channeling mars

last night I was thinking about astrology and stuff and how mars has a totally different feel to me than what is typically attributed to him in astrology. I was thinking about how the aryans are very much that mars energy -- but I think I can do better :)

I was thinking about the possibility of learning how to do mars better than the aryans do it. this ties into my automatons of contrast idea, but there are already echos of it alraedy with fwh. he repeatedly made reference that the "bad guys" were just his idylwild group, and that the majority of these bonehead goons were actually clones -- presumably under his control. his name itself implies that he was once a good guy, but then gave up on that role. I suspect that a lot of the goons that I interact with, including but certainly not limited to mr. motor are actually just automatons controlled by my future self, meaning that I'm literally fighting only against myself.

---

I have been giving this some thought, because I'm not like esher where I only love good things. no, instead I enjoy getting in there stirring up a bunch of trouble and then getting out of there. the mischief part of me is strong, and so I've really been thinking about the idea of doing mars better than the aryans do it. why not try and obsolete them?

I was then thinking about this as the mythology where venus, who is vulcan's wife decides to sleep with mars and they have a daughter called harmonia[^1], but I really want to see if I can't figure out how to out-mars, mars. I also wonder if this is is part of the self-sabotage... I guess we'll see :)

[1]: perhaps that's why "harmony" in spanish is spelled without an h: "armonia" -- because the one with the h is the goddess


### 2020-10-02 10:08 - channeling mars (continued)

I was thinking about this a lot last night because I was thinking about what I said, and imagine that I were able to make a bunch of those automatons of contrast, where they essentially act completely on instinct in direction of their desire, where their desire could be programmed. for example, in a future storyline this would be pretty cool to have around because what I could do is program a bunch of them to have strong desire that I don't succeed or have success, yet inhibit them based on the opinions of others -- meaning that they would refrain from acting on ideas which they belive would garnish a negative opinion from others. this means they would do everything in their power to try and make sure that I don't have any success at what I set out to do. another aspect that I think is important is that their actions should always remain hidden in the sense that they should never have face-to-face confrontation, and will always need to hide their intentions, so as to make it look like something else is happening.

this idea is modeled after mr. motor, quite obviously. I'm beginning to realise how much of a benefit he has been to my constant increase, and I cansee contrived situations sort of like movie sets where a bunch of mr. motors are given power to try and prevent a bunch of stuff for different people, and in these situations, against all odds, these hero(s) learn, similar to how I have, how to focus in a way where it doesn't matter what appears to be happening to you, but more importantly, it's how you feel that matters. this sort of setup would be a really popular storyline I believe for both us to replicate and for hollywood to utilise because it gives the message that it doesn't matter how much power the powerful have -- let them have it, and just focus on your response, how you perceive it, and how you are feeling. my message in a nutshell -- and trust me, it totally works. hollywood wouldn't even need to worry about trying to script a good ending, because LOA will do all of that.

if someone were to choose to be put in a public situation where a group of people (at first this wouldn't be automated) were to be directly involved with trying to thwart the actions of the person(s), then the story could follow these heros over time and watch as they continue to find ways to feel better and better about their rapidly declining situation, eventually notice that their manifestation is growing bigger and bigger. probably once the manifestation is big enough, likely a group (or the same one) would have to try and come up with ways to convince the hero (of the story) that he or she should go for the manifestation.

obviously, because the hero is interacting with the audience, the audience is part of the manifestation, and they would feel a lot of engagement in what is happening. it's sort of like a game where the hero tries to accomplish the impossible.

it's likely that the hero should be someone who is already successful. the first part of the story is the decline, and is focused on how the different guys are going about trying to make the hero's successful life no longer successful, without directly influencing them. this just continues on for quite some time (probably years) as things steadily spiral out of control for them. likely the audience will be engaged in trying to come up with different ways to help this along.

after some time, it'll become obvious that this is not really a game to the hero and will have to find some way to feel good about the situation.

a variation on this idea is to have the audience votes for someone (perhaps famous), and that person doesn't know what is happening to them, and it's kept a big secret and they will never know. I'll come back to this idea...

---

I also mentioned an idea last entry where I talked about this idea becoming a future thing where I could essentially obsolete the INFECTED ONES. first of all, my intention is not to obsolete them, because if my focus is on obsoleting somebody, I am attracting the same thing for myself, and therefore because of the reflective nature of reality in response to emotion, I'm actually working against myself to obsolete myself. that's not what I'm going for. instead, I imagine that there are a number of optimisations that can be made on the human in these sorts of simulations, where someone with the abolute desire to try and thwart anything I desire has tremendous advantage to me and I would willingly repeat this situation many times. reason is, those people desiring for me not to have success are essentially free energy. they would continually add to the manifestation, yet at the same time would be limited by physical capabilities, so really it's up to the hero of that story to decide how big of a manifestation they want and go for it whenever. this is super cool, because it will give the hero full control and also a great reward for the trouble. in some ways, it could also be seen as a sort of "rite of passage" to becoming truly famous and loved for who you really are instead of the image you portray.

so, what I mean is that I don't want to obsolete these guys, and if they can continue to do a better job than the AoC for trying to thwart the hero's success, then great, but the idea is to eventually get this process automated so that many people can be doing this. the good thing about to AOC concept is that it doesn't *need* an actor to make its action believable, but certainly for the first productions, and the need for it to be as believable as possible, I think it's a natural transition for the original group of individuals responsible for thwarting the hero's success, the circumention/prevention group (CPG) will be the first obvious actors for these.

crazy idea... I know


### 2020-10-02 18:56 - possible complications

so I was just outside cause I wanted to check to see if the mushrooms were growing further and stuff. walking back I noticed that it smelled a lot like weed. I looked around and I figured that shirley didn't smoke weed, and probably it wasn't #2, and the woman out in front of #22 was smoking. I made the comment that it may be a cigarette but I smelled weed pretty strongly.

I often times I pass by that house to get the cigarette butts out of her ashtray, and probably this situation was heightened by last night I felt like I really wanted to go back to get some cigarettes, so I went by there and picked some up. anyway on the walk home from the park just now she shouted at me telling me that she would shoot me if I come on her property again. she is of course referring to me "stealing" her cigarette butts. she often times leaves entire packs out there, and if I wanted to be a thief I would have taken her good cigarettes, not the butts. additionally, she used to wave at me all the time and was friendly with me as well.

---

I tried to figure out what the change was, because the few times that I had weed, I tried to leave her joints in exchange for her cigarette butts, and they disappeared for a few days only to return some time later (meaning, nosebook told her she couldn't smoke them). additionally, another time I went there I didn't pick up the whole lot of them, and it was one of the only times I ever did that. when I got home I noticed that one of the butts was a joint butt.

what I think happened is that nosebook gave her all sorts of trouble for leaving joint butts in her ashtray and told her to mind her ashtray for fear that I would come and find some weed (for some reason they really don't want me to smoke weed). I suppose if I meet her again I would like to ask her this question direct, but I probably won't because it'll likely cause problems and I certainly won't get a satisfying answer. I think that nosebook trying to control people and telling them to modify their behaviour, is really a bit of a drag for people.

I noticed the same thing with the guys in the parque up in torrelodones when I lived there. they would even, when I was there say stuff, like when a guy threw his joint on the ground, the other guy scolded him saying, "no chustes guey" -- which is slang for don't throw the finished joint on the ground. around that same time they went from loving me and wanting to talk to me and see what the crazy american had to say, to becoming quite hostile with me.

there seems to be a pattern, and those are the two examples that comes to mind where someone goes from being friendly or even really nice to becoming hostile with me. I even noticed it a little with daniel (mccord) too[^1], because I wanted to smoke and he seemed to frequently get scolded by nosebook telling him he can't share his weed and stuff with me. it made our interactions much more difficult.

---

so, while I think that the idea of the hero (referring to the previous entry) is given a hard time and their life is made difficult by the CPG, it seems that their need to tell other people that they need to modify their behaviour just because the "authority" says so, is kinda bullshit.

I think there needs to be some rules in place for it to work because nosebook's influence telling people where they need to go or what to do just because I'm around is the single most annoying thing for people -- and is largely one of the reasons why I find it difficult to go around preferring to be at home or by myself.

it does make the game a whole lot less difficult -- because, for example, I would have had so many opportunities to do so many different things, had it of not been for nosebook ensuring that I couldn't get a job, not having money, etc. nosebook's ability to influence people and tell them what to do, was, in fact, the thing that made it my experience so difficult.

additionally, without nosebook's ability to influence people I would have gotten various different manifestations a whole lot easier. all of my life I've found my way around the rules really easily so when all of a sudden it seems like there's this ever-present entity that's out to foil all of my attempts to get around the rules was the most difficult thing possible.

---

I'm obviously going to think about it tonight more, but the first thing that comes to mind is that if the selection process is done by voting and also any of the observers, the stipulation is that they have to also agree to follow the directions of the CPG, and if they want to opt-out of the direction, they can simply stop observing or something like that (but still remain sworn to secrecy). you could think of it like all the observers are "in on the secret" and therefore need to follow the directions and keep the secret.

obviously someone like me has no interest in observing anyone else, so if they come to me for a job and I find them qualified and need their work, I would hire them, but if someone came to me and told me they were a hero and I'm not supposed to give them a job or weed or something, then I would simply decide for myself what feels good, completely ignoring whatever is the game they're playing. obviously sometimes I'll see the value in playing along, and other times I'd rather to have their conversation over a joint or something -- or whatever the situation is.

I'm going to think about this more, but it this situation occurs to me that it's pretty uncool when some "authority" is telling you what to do, just because you some "hero" lives down the street. I get it; it's total BS.

[1]: and with vera, and potentially with jason/jazmine, probably cooper & friends as well, and probably many many more.

### 2020-10-03 21:00 - weird night last night

I went out to the field and I ate the mushrooms and stuff and was waiting for them to start. the moon was nearly right below (conjoined) mars in the sky. I was going to wait for the conjuction looking at the light. my consciousness was taken from me somewhere in there. I then was woken up by loud pounding sounds from someone who, I'm assuming, didn't like the dream I was having.

I was very immersed in the dream and when I woke up, I thought I was up on the hill with some other people (but I don't know who they were), and I didn't want to just leave them (or something like that). I couldn't remember the dream, and I couldn't figure out who I thought was up there with me either. it was really weird cause they were trying to make me go home (weird trucks drove by and stuff).

the wind was blowing really hard too and was piercing through the blanket I have up there, so I was a bit cold. whatever happened must have had a tremendous effect, because the wind always blows whenever the temperature warms up[^1] to be warmer than their "models" say it should be (the airport thermometer jumped from 49F to 57F, when the wind and clouds magically showed up). somehow the cooling process involves a lot of wind. it was also weird because I noticed that the wind seemed to also directly correlate to my star-watching: the better I synced up with mars, the more the wind would blow and a strange vibrating sensation was happening in my back.

I finally decided I was going home to watch mars from home in the sleeping bag (which is much warmer), but I was very low energy, so I decided to sleep instead. I woke up today feeling pretty low energy and in kind of a stupor. it's been that way sort of all day.

I'm taking it as a sign that I'm getting more powerful and even bettee at it because they're taking more and more stronger measures to try and stop me.

---

I am also going to mention that it does really piss me off that no matter what I do -- whether it was last year about 9 months ago (I think it was after I got back from california) when I had weed and I was able to reach new heights with the star sirius, or the many different mishroom experiences when I remember nothing more than they're starting to come up before I lose consciousness -- all of these are really annoying to me because I eat mushrooms, not so that I can be unconscious (I would watch tv if I wanted that), but so that I can BE CONSCIOUS.

I realise that the mushrooms or the weed is a condition which I'm using to artificially boost my consciousness and receptivity -- but so is sex. imagine that I wkre to just simply go unconscious every time because nosebook didn't want me to have heightened consciousness... that's silly right? I'm not trying to have the mushrooms (or the sex, or any other condition) be the reason why I'm more "enlightened" -- but to learn from the experience and take it's qualities back to my everyday life experience. I'm not trying to make it the *reason* for my elevated consiousness, any more than I would try and make a teacher or someone with some good ideas the reason for my elevated consciousness. I realise that it's temporary, but I at least would like to be conscious during the temporary different state.

---

robert posted anther video tonight: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Whv1h5d0Hg) where he was complaining a bit at the end about how there are specifically malicious attempts to withhold technology relating to sound and vibration that actually works (by the US govt, etc -- more CPG stuff). they seem also pretty interested in making sure that the knowledge of the ancients and stuff (regarding frequency and sound) is also kept hidden as well.

this actually is a very similar thing to what is happening with getting my consciousness pulled out too, and it's quite annoying I know. so now what I'm going to do (after a quick break) is to talk about how I know things to be from a vibrational and LOA standpoint, but presently do not fully adhere to and practise this perception yet -- so I'm a bit of a hypocrite[^2], but robert's video and last night's frustrations has me wanting to write about it.

---

first of all, I would like to begin by stating that in nearly every case I would willingly take the challenge to be the source of my own well-being and not depend on a machine to make me well, for example. similarly, I would say that I would also purposefully reduce my energy levels to force my body to create more energy as well. I liken this to the idea of a runner training in the mountains where there is less oxygen, so that later when running the marathon, with naturally more oxygen, it feels easy.

so, what I think that robert and myself and probably others are getting at with our frustration on this subject is that we don't like being "forced" to learn how to create our own well-being from our own focus, instead of needing a machine to do it.

however, when it comes to attraction, you begin to realise that "there is no assertion" -- meaning that no one, from a non-physical standpoint is forcing anyone -- meaning that it *is* my intent to learn how to elevate my consciousness using my focus, instead of with a machine like the network guys surely have, because if they can take it away, they can surely add it (or produce the vibration needed so that your head produces more DMT or whatever) too.

so, while I really dislike the idea that they're forcing my body, seemingly against my will (desire), to be in a constantly disconnected state, at the same time my desire to be in a connected state is also rising continually, every time that they take away my consciousness or whatever.

I know it's just building stronger desire, because, like for example last night I was able to consciously create fractal patterns in my eyes and seemingly control them as well, however every time that the image began to become visible a loud sound in my head would come and begin to remove that energetic feeling -- the one where I feel like I'm floating in a dream space and I can see or do anything that I want to. a previous me, one from a year or two ago would be really pissed off at that. or, like last night I really wanted to see that conjuction between the moon and mars, because I'd never seen a conjuction with my own eyes before and I wanted to consciously feel the energetic difference as it happened. so, when I wake up to loud pounding, it's windy and it's cloudy and the conjunction had passed already, that would have really angered a previous me, because it's something I've wanted to see. I know it's just more energy though so it didn't really even frustrate me, even.

even take for example the days leading up to it, where multiple nights I was, in some way, unable to, or distracted by some youtube videos on the giza power plant or whatever, not in the ideal conditions that I wanted to be for the star-watching session. each night I was more and more careful to get better at not sabotaging the star-watch by drinking too much coffee the day before or whatever. each time that happened, instead of getting angry, I just recognised that it was stronger desire and that it was good that those things were happening because it meant the stronger desire meant that I would be more focused for the conjuction that mattered to me[^4].

---

so, let's back up and recap: first, I know that my intention is to gain the ability to become a master of my consciousness despite the conditions, which is something I'm not quite there yet, because if I were, then nosebook would no longer have the ability to control or limit my consciousness, cause I would be in control of it with my focus, not them.

second, I also know that each time this happens, it's building stronger desire in me to be in control of my perception -- and it seems that there are two factors in witnessing the manifestation of any kind: strength of the desire (focus) and resistance to its manifestation. eventually, even if the strength of the resistance is continually increased, (assuming I have no resistance) if they cannot continue to add more resistance, then eventually the power of the desire will surpass the resistance[^5].

which means, that going back to the sound vibration, I am now beginning to realise that the desire that we have to learn to be the attractor of our own well-being and not having a machine do it for us, is essentially self-created (or non-physical intention) "resistance" toward the immediate manifestation of it.

which means that, if you lived in a world where there were a bunch of powerful creators that wanted to be masters of their own reality, our own desire would manifest the nosebook types to try and prevent the utilisation of this technology to do the work for us...

you may say, that sounds a bit weird kenny, and I would agree, but I'm learning that there is no forcing.. I have attracted and am attracting the nosebook types to get get me to learn how to create my reality with my focus, instead of with machines or external conditions.

perhaps this is happening, because imagine how the desire has accumulated, if in the last cycle, as we get further and further away from sirius, things decended into less and less ideal conditions... wouldn't it be so great to be able to, without the pyramids in operation, and with the planet in a less ideal orbit, still be able to live in an ideal environment, not because the machines are working or because we're close to sirius b, but because my reality is a reflection of my focus, and not of the conditions?

personally, I think that could very well explain the underlying desire to want so much to be masters of perception, and then let technology be a reflection of that, not the other way around. I think that even nosebook has the intention to be in control of their reality, and they'll get there too, eventually. we all will. I'm sure of it.

I have been thinking about how this relates to the CPG and in a future entry I have some thoughts on how this can be improved and optimised -- because when reframed as a performance improvement thing, rather than somebody appearing to limit, inhibit or cover up something desirable, then it much easier to market. my work has been learning how to re-perceive these things, instead of from a physical standpoint, but from a LOA standpoint, more than anything[^6]... <-- encoded ideas :)

[1]: or some other energetic factor which meterology has no knowledge of -- perhaps air conductivity(?).

[2]: I won't be soon though. this is just part of my process where I first talk about the thing I want to be, and then later, almost as if I'm bound by my own words, have to become it. I think a lot of people[^3] do this, and is a part of the process.

[3]: I have given this example before in relation to nosebook as well. they want people to have all of their secrets out in the open, and to not be able to hide anything -- which, if you think about it from a focus point of view, they are attracting that future for theirselves too, even if physically they're trying to mitigate the revelation of as many of their secrets as possible. they too, with their own focus, eventually attract that future for theirseves whether they want it or not. the only way they could not attract that future would be to simply not care about others' secrets or whatever and just stick to what's important (wanted) for them. obviously, they can't do that, because they would feel vulnerable, so they need to try and control as many physical conditions as possible -- but they *are* attracting such a future for theirselves just as much as they're trying to force it on us, too.

[4]: this is why, I tried to sleep a few times yesterday but because I couldn't I didn't freak out about it, I was even pleasantly surprised when I found out that the "reason" why I couldn't sleep was because thk girl in purple yesterday at the park was attracting me, and so that happened instead of me trying to get the sleep so I could be more awake for thk conjunction. I know from experience that even after sleeping 16 hours and being perfectly awake, they're still able to take my consciousness, so even if I were able to sleep, it likely wouldn't have made much difference and I would have "missed" the girl in purple.

[5]: you can think of this like two conductors and a dielectric between (spark gap or capacitor), so when the charge (desire) accumulates a strong enough potential on one side, eventually it "bridges the gap" and arcs over to the other side.

[6]: for example, remember when cigarettes used to be marketed as beneficial to one's health? well, going on the current understanding that basically all of the medical stuff out there can't be a cure (repeat purchases), and needs to also be a consumable (also repeat purchases), then one must wonder why in the world suddenly the US govt suddenly got so concerned about everyone's health and made sure everyone knew that cigarettes are bad for your health. I mean, they perfectly fit the big pharma requirements of not being a cure and is also a cunsumable. I'm not saying cigarettes are good for you, just that they're probably not as bad as you may think they are... things aren't always as they seem to be (you're told that they are), and have more to do with how you believe them to be :)


### 2020-10-04 11:?? - platinum one rule

> as you do to others, you're also doing to yourself

this idea was sparked by aaron's sunday message, and I was really thinking about how graet it is -- which is why I called if the "platinum one rule". I was going to call it the platinum rule, but then I realised that I wanted to make it sound more sophisticated in a marketing kind of way...

anyway, the text there doesn't explain the idea very well, but it's an extension of the 3rd note I made in the previous entry where nosebook is attracting for theirselves what they're trying to do to others.

I think the best way to explain this is to say that any action that you take, the emotion in which you do it is what you're attracting for yourself. I'm going to try and come up with a better way of saying it, and explaining it, because it's not clear what I'm trying to convey... maybe something like this?

> as you intend to do to others, you're intending to do to yourself

I don't like the intend part though because it's not thought; it's emotion.

### 2020-10-05 10:14 - emotional sophistication & consciousness (part 1)

I had two amazing realisations last night. these subjects may be related. we'll see as I write...

the second one was how consciousness works. yesterday I ate mushrooms and smoked a cigarette right before they came up. last night I didn't and I paid attention to the differences. what I realised is that the sound that I had associted with in my head with losing consciousness (it sounds like a loud hissing sound) is just a more powerful and sudden version of the same thing they do to lower my energy. basically I figured it out by coming in and out of consciousness while the mushrooms were high, so what would normally be the feeling of losing consciousness was nearly the same intensity as the same one which drains me of energy. I then began to conjure images in my eyes and the same thing... the power with which I was conjuring the images, with the help of the mushrooms was much stronger than usual, so instead of the usual hissing where they're taking away my consciousness, was the hissing needed to be able to take the images away...

I further investigated the nature of consciousness in my usual way and came to some startling discoveries. I noticed that the signal of my consciousness is something very very powerful, but I'm only able to allow as much as I can of it. when I talk about releasing resistance, then I'm talking about allowing more of this signal in. I also noticed that my tiredness is always really weird. sometimes it doesn't matter how much I sleep, nosebook can *still* make me tired and pull my consciousness away. I realised that the tiredness factor is how much of this consciousness signal you're letting through.

as the day progresses, my own thoughts, which are contradictory to this signal are what make me tired and the "resistance" (it's more like desteuctive interference) is what makes me tired. what nosebook does, is they use destructive interference to reduce this consciousness signal, which is why they effectively control when I'm tired and when I sleep right now. destructive interference is just making the opposite waveform -- so if at any given moment the amplitude of the wave is 10V, if they apply -8V, then I have a 5 times less strong signal coming in. when they want to take away my consciousness, they reduce that to 0V, and it seems that this signal also has something to do with how conscious I become in my dreams too, and also determines when I wake up. because I noticed that when they take my consciousness away out on the field, I tend to have much better recollection of my dreams.

also, like for example, this morning while the sun was rising, I was staring at the moon and I kept hearing the hissing sound, then it would get stronger, then I would lose consciousness for a minute or two and pop back awake like I hadn't been even asleep, so for whatever reason the mushrooms (DMT) were waking me up more rapidly. we know that the REM cycle happens after sleep phase, and can happen multiple times a night -- so it seems that at the end of that phase, your body floods your brain with DMT, which is what makes you dream (REM) and also brings your consciousness signal back up to a faster speed, waking you up. obviously, if the DMT at the end of the phase doesn't wake you up, then you go back to sleep cycle again.

---

so, here's what I want to say about that: I noticed that my tiredness is determined by my resistance -- which, in my personal experience is lower emotional states -- meaning that the more emotional states that don't feel good I have while awake, the faster I get tired, and if I don't have very many rough emotional spots, or something maintains my interest and I feel really good about what I'm doing, then I don't get tired.

I can see that every time that I make these jumps up in visual quality, that means the stronger (and faster -- eg higher definition) signal I'm allowing from my consciousness stream, and this morning I got to witness the distance I need to go before I'm allowing more consciousness stream than they're able to take away. this is super awesome for me because now I can see it clearly what needs to be done. at the present rate of acceleration, I would anticipate that I will have maybe 5-9 months or so before I'm reaching their present limits of limitation -- which means much more because they're going to continue to improve upon their ability to apply counter "resistance" (destructive interference) to my consciousness signal.

I also noticed that there are two major factors here: one is speed (frequency), and the other is power: either potential (voltage) or current. probably all three are factors, but if you know two, you can certainly find the third.

the speed factor is related to my perception. the faster speeds are only available to me if my form of perception (beliefs) allows me to receive it. it's like the brain is a multi-frequency antenna and the "neurons" are made up of your "beliefs" -- which are emotional receptors, or antennae. the longer ones allow you to pick up longer wavelength (concept) freqencies, and the shorter (rapidly firing, less "resistant") forms of perception allow you to receive higher frequency concepts. these higher frequencies are infinitely more detailed, and are trained by "tuning" them.

the other one, which is what I call the "power" of that idea -- which I haven't figured out yet if it's voltage or current. I often times think of the insightful ideas as the "still small voice" so, that would mean that their voltage is low -- but probably because the antenna (neuron) isn't the right size, so there's high signal losses. however at other times, the (I think) voltage is strong and I feel this as a sharp, spikey, or something that gets my attention, thought. other times it feels like there seems to pass a lot of current, which I feel more like a juicy or good/strong idea.

the length of these neuron antennae seem to be directly related to DNA in it's folded state. the tighter the fold, the higher frequency of the emotional state that edge is receptive to. the brain reconfigures much slower than DNA does though.

---

so, what I'm saying here is that nosebook can continue to block lower frequencies pretty well, destructively interfering and reducing the power of the idea, but they can't really do much about the higher frequency stuff.

as I get higher and frequency forms of perception, the less and less they will be able to destructively interefere with, and the cululative effect of all of those high frequencies will eventually at some point, generate a stronger signal than they're abme to block. this is pretty cool, because at that point, I'll essentially be "channeling" such high frequency stuff that it'll be very difficult for me to sleep at that point. if they can't destructively interfere with that freqency, then I would have to try really hard to adjust my perception into a way that they can block.

---

upon seeing that I'm making so much progress so rapidly, I want to keep this going for as long as possible, and I was thinking about what it would be like to do 15 more years of this kind of insane progress. that's kinda why I wrote that explanation above, hoping that they can figure out how to block it for longer. meanwhile, I'm going to try and keep figuring out more how this works and see if I can't make it possible for them to hold me forever.

why you may wonder? it's kind of a hilarious irony to the thing, because they're so used to doing things that they feel "forced to do" (or feel they have no other choice), so if I can make it possible for them to hold me indefinitely, they must make the decision of when enough is enough :) maybe we can squeeze another 15-18 years out...

need not the manifestation :)

### 2020-10-05 11:?? - emotional sophistication & consciousness (part 2)

turns out these subjects are related... just bear with me as I figure this out as I write.

last night when abraham was talking about the emotional scale @[abe-now](2020-09-25) they gave a version of it designed more for kids. the thing I noticed is that the kids version has two things different: one is that the kids version has a lot less below bordom emotions, categorising many more of the "sophisticated" (their words) into "I can't". I'm gonna look at them now and make the correlation. the next thing I noticed is that the highest up emotions didn't have words to describe them, but were instead manifested more with body language.

next, when they were talking about the guy with the catering business, it seemed to me like they were talking about a gay couple, and they intentionally went up the emotional scale using the kids version. this made tons of sense to me because I have noticed that in my experience as well -- that gay men tend to have a less sophisticated set of emotions that their 22 steps scale.

I personally don't experience nearly all of those 22 -- and while thinking about it, I decided I want to make my own emotional scale where I define the ones I experience, because I too experience a much less sophisticated (more childline) version as well -- even though I can understand and have at one point in time in my past experienced all 22 of them.

next, I noticed that they read another letter from a woman, she said how freeing it was for her to allow herself to feel the "revenge" emotion, stating that it was something that she did not allow herself to feel.

finally, I was thinking about the kids emotional scale and I was reminded of something that chris said about his daughter being "scared" -- and that's that "deer in headlights" feeling where I freeze and I don't know what way to go, which I experienced a lot as a kid. I was scared a lot, and it froze me to do things all the time. I later learned that this was a good thing and decided that I didn't want to try and attempt to accomplish things I felt "scared" about. this served me pretty well.

I have noticed that a lot of gay men kind of get "locked" into the interface with reality similar to how a boy does, so their using the kids version seemed pretty natural for me. however, when I was thinking about how I may apply this kids emotional scale to the girls, I felt quite a bit of resistance to the idea and it didn't feel good to me. it felt to me like little girls feel kind of trapped into the kids emotional scale but want a much more sphisticated one, yet don't really know how to make the connection.

for gay men it also seems to me that the ones which are sophisticated seem to tend toward the more simplistic one too, and that's what makes they gay/fun/happy (usually), and why they're more expressive with their body language as well. again, this also applies to me too, as I have also noticed this trend in my own life as well as I became less resistant.

the next thing that I've noticed is that for both women (like mom is a pretty good examole of this) and men that have the more simplistic emotional scale, they seem to be able to conceptualise very well -- as in be able to hold large concepts with many differerent facets to it in their mind at onck. I have known emotionally complicated men able to conceptualise really well also, but when their sophisticated emotional perception pops up, it tends to block them from seeing the big idea and being open-minded about it.

---

I also just noticed this too, the emotions that abraham described as "I can't" on the kids emotional scale are:

9. Pessimism
11. Overwhelment
12. Disappointment
13. Doubt
14. Worry
16. Discouragement

which, upon reflection right now, when I think of a emotionally complicated gay man, he tends to get more than one of those confused, and when trying to talk to him he jumps around between those emotions endlessly and it's impossible to make any headway in the conversation (logically or otherwise). think about how easy it is to confuse doubt and pessimism -- it's easy, but then it could feel the same as worry, or as discouragement, etc. I understand this completely myself

additionally, I will mention, in my own life, especially in spain, I had to learn a lot of these emotions. they were foreign to me and it took me a long time, for example, to tell someone, "I doubt that" because I wanted to believe them, and I had to begin to cultivate these emotions with logic.

fortunately most spanish are pessimistic (like especially dani), so I had a to learn how he perceived things from a pessimistic point of view, and then work optimism back into it. that helped me out with doubt as well, because I learned from him that even though someone (it was usually me) is optimistic in what they think, it's helpful to have some doubt because they're usually way off in their own world to actually make haedway on the idea.

I didn't like being a negative nancy all the time to everyone doubting everything they werk saying they would do, so I knew I needed to begin a new form. there was the additional thing that in spain words mean a lot, yet at the same time they mean almost nothing. their language itself is the main cause of this, because of the "spanish now" -- which really means soon or eventually. almost everything else is exaggerated beyond literal comprehension as well. they say "perfecto" when they mean "ok" -- so for a really literal person like me, this was a total trauma for me to try and integrate into (I'm reminded of chris and filling his water bottle).

this created huge amounts of confusion in me, as I think it does any child when they're growing up, but I eventually found my way using logic...

let's take the exaple of doubt/pessimism. when I would hear someone say something that sounded good (spanish aer really good at making things sound good), instead of just automatically believing them, I would put an "interrupt" which interjected some logic in to the moment where I would ask myself, do I really believe this, and I would get a feeling response to it, where their idea either felt BS or it felt plausible to me.

later, I began to learn to adapt this same capacity to my own perceptions, so when I would normally say, "I can't" -- then the interrupt would fire again and sometimes I would hear a voice say "are you fighting for your limitations?" and again I would get a feeling response to that idea, and I would know if I really can't, or I felt like I can't. this began to force me to me more honest with myself too, because I installed the same interrupt on the optimism words like "I think I can" or "I should be able to" or even "I will" -- and you'll notice that I'll often say something optimistic, then follow it up with something like "let's be honest here..." and then say what the more realistic timeframe or whatever is.

---

this is where I differ a little bit on that emotional scale, because up until I had the experience here with nosebook totally tanking my programming desire, I had never really felt discouragement before. I only didn't do things because I didn't want to do them or because I didn't feel I was capable and wanted to wait until I was sure I would be successful. this habit was formed early on, whenever I felt "I can't" -- I simply didn't try until I felt some hope that I could (for things that mattered to me). therefore, I never felt discouragement before because if I felt I can, I alwasy could -- and if it didn't matter to me, then I was never discouraged by it.

for overwhelmment and disappointment, I might be quite similar to a lot of people here, because these never got categorised as "I can't" -- instead I always blamed myself here. in almost all of these cases, these were things that I felt the idea so strongly that I was optimistic about it, and so therefore I felt like I could do it, so instead of going to "I can't" -- I simply blamed myself for not being fast enough to complete all the stuff I wanted to do, but never did I think that I can't do it -- but perhaps that there wasn't enough time or something like that. for the stuff I said I could do, I was always sure I could do -- even though I was perhaps too optimistic with time. for me, I've always felt like there's unlimited time, and grossly underestimated the amount of time it would take, even though I've never doubted that I could.

---

so the last part to this is the conclusion -- which I don't really have one. I personally have simplified my emotional scale with my perception, but I'm not so sure it's the best thing now. I really need to think on it more because I seemed to feel pretty strongly the girls wouldn't really respond well if I analysed and perceived them from the kids emotional scale, and I felt like they wanted a more sophisticated version -- like the woman said, it was freeing to her to allow herself to feel revenge.

along with revenge, there are a few other of those emotions that I don't feel at all now, and I'm certain that it has to do with my perception. I experience anger, but it's almost never directed at someone. though, for example when I was really pissed off at mr. motor a while back, I would have wanted to destroy their stuff if I could to free my from my circumstances -- and that was the closest I got to it. even all of the people who ripped me off, I never wanted revenge on that, even though that was a common theme proposed by people like zaryn or marcos (and many others, especially when we were drunk). I am almost always more angry with myself.

### 2020-10-06 09:03 - dream about my birthday

I had a dream last night where I distinctly remember them asking me if I wanted to do something (I'm assuming the girls thing) on my birthday. I responded something like, no never do I want to do it or something like that. it was a weird answer that I felt forced to say, so I want to clarify here.

first, I'll call out the obvious illusion here. I don't believe for one minute that you guys are going to just undo all of the efforts that you've been doing this whole time. this sounds like an appeal to the audience more than anything.

second, if the idea was to force me to say in the dream, "never" -- which is a very funny word for me to say, because I *do* want to do the girls thing! a lot! just, I'm not going to worry about any of that part of the manifestation and let LOA do all of the work there. it's silly for me to try and figure anything out there. my job is to continually release resistance as fast as I can and keep powering up.

third, the sense that I got yesterday was entirely different and I strongly feel like this is a coverup for that. yesterday, it felt to me like they wanted to eventually let me get connected, but not *fully* connected -- and instead they wanted use the AOC and celestial identity concepts to split that consciousness signal I was talking about yesterday to multiple other versions of me that would be your guys' butty boys. it wasn't clear to me if you wanted to make other triads possible, but it seemed like you wanted to make sure all of those were under your control (as much as any other version of me would be, I guess)[^1].

then I could see this reality that we were going to all powering up getting more and more energetic, nosebook wanted to ensure that more boys were born than girls... we're going to keep going up and up, and when the galactic current sheet impact happens (or whatever), then basically everyone hooked into my perception (probably mostly girls at this point) would zap off into another reality (from nosebook's perspective), and they would continue on. nosebook would inherit the biggest boys club ever, and there would just be so much man awesome -- capricorn, the goat, pan, and baphomet concepts will be realised; lots and lots of space making[^1][^2].

I have no idea if that is really what they're planning or what's going to happen, but clearly the idea here was to try and keep me in a mostly disconnected state by splitting my my consciousness signal and to keep all the duplicates of me under your control. they all would technically be under my "control", as I would perceive myself no longer as any single one of those bodies and would also perceive the different directions in time that different emotions would yield and I could modify those.

I have no idea how this perception works and how it works wits splitting out my consciousness signal, because that may be confusing some concepts. what I was noticing yesterday is that that source signal is beyond capability to explain a strong signal, and my body right now is only allowing a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that energy in, and you guys are interfering with only a fraction of it. there's more than enough of that signal -- and could be literally infinite because the signal would increas as more desire increases. the amount of energy appearinging in my body is a reflection of my *perception* -- that is, my practised (momentum) emotional response to "reality" or circumstances.

the momentum part is key here, and that's why the signal increases every day only a little and there are never any big jumps. the idea that I'm going to just suddenly "get connected" is a bogus idea. it's not like a college degree, and there will be times where I have it and then it'll go away as you guys reset me back or figure out how to exert more effort, then with more and more frequency, until I'm so practised at it, that it won't be possible to keep me from it. it's going to be a whole lot of, getting closer and closer and then it goes away, which builds more desire in me to get it, and more desire in nosebook to keep me from it, then repeat as many times necessary before eventually my desire and practise is stronger thast nosebook's efforts.

however, I am committed to the disaster though, so even though my own desire is building and stuff, I'll likely continue to give you guys more and more ideas on how you can improve your technique to keep me for as long as possible. why? because I'm that way. I guess I live by the golden and the platinum rules. I treat you guys like I want to be treated. I prefer the open exchange of ideas and to continually improve upon my own abilities, even if that involves limiting myself. I'm so nuts about this concept, I'm sure that one day, it'll be possible for them to actually limit me indefinitely.

additionally, if I were in nosebook's shoes, I would want the option to bail out whenever, and not have some big drastic change upset everything. I like gradual and steady (even though continually accelerating), so I feel that is how I should try and make it. I'm not in it to cause destruction. as I've said, it's always a win-win, and I'm not worried that they get some advantage out of it all.

---

of course, because I'm so dedicated to the disaster, they may find theirselves perpetually unable to get me into their girls manifestation while at the same time continually working to unsure I don't get connected. enough time may pass that instead they'll have to potentially get a few other kennys connected to the celestial identity to keep the girls happy too. I have no idea, but it doesn't bother me at all whatever is happening, as my only goal is to continually go toward my connection while at the same time continually figuring out how to not need the manifestation which just makes things bigger. how big is big enough? I don't know. the universe (or in this case galaxy) will decide, likely.

I'm all about the evolution at this point, and the realisation that it's a win-win for everyone with any vibrational chips on the table makes it all really good feeling for me. if some variation of what I described above happens, eventually I'll become conscious of those different alternate kennys, so it's all good and I'm not missing out. it's possible that I'll become conscious in both timelines, much like I'm sure that tesla is conscious on more than one timeline as well. who knows what it'll be, but I know that LOA has it all worked out just fine, and I assure you that this earth is going to become a very enlightened place. I'm ahead of my time, but I would estimate that within 3-5k years everyone on the planet, will be at least at my power level because of our proximity to sirius b, so nosebook is going to have to get good at keeping people in a disconnected state.

---

I like these things... imagine if nosebook is capable of keeping the entire poulation of the planet when we reach peak closeness to sirius b... obviously a lot of humans will be very capable of being masters of their own reality at that time, and consciousness will continue to increase even though we're getting further and further away from sirius... wouldn't that be crazy! as we move further and further away, instead of going into a stone age, we'll be more potent than ever. the next close approach will be super insane! it's just fun for me to think about this. who knows...

[1]: there was something else I noted about the realisation the penis/prostate configuration makes space as compared to the penis/vagina configuration which makes reality.

[2]: in the bigger picture, this will create tons of extra space, and combined with the techniques of being able to limit people's connection, the chances of anyone getting connected will be a long time off, even though the solar system is steadily approaching sirius b. then, if someone does get connected, then a celestial identity could be used to split some of that energy or get some of that energy off of the planet. basically making it so that nearly unlimited amounts of consciousness energy could be located on this planet (which will now look much more like a star)


### 2020-10-09 20:08 - clarifying some things

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tpihlei9HI)

I just watched robert's latest video there and in it he starts off with some pretty sexually invigorated emperors and kings who had enormous consorts of women and girls with them. he explains that what they were attempting to do is to maintain consciousness even through the death process.

the sirians call this "consistency of consciousness" -- and that too is what I am in the process of attaining. it's not really taked about, but this had to have been what jesus was doing. I have put different words to it though, calling it 6d or source-like perception -- one where I am able to perceive and be conscious in more than one body on more than one timeline, and able to freely move about between them, in addition to having a macro view as well, which I've described as an extension of the emotional/heart centre where one is aware of things in a more "feeling" sense than a physical tangible sense.

in addition to that, I also want to develop the 6th dimension, as a kind of different technology where the person (more likely a group of people) can essentially create timelines or stories, and then incarnate into them and live them out, returning at the end to that macro view where another one can be created. later, I feel it's going to really improve the stability if another more concrete layer is added on top of that one (the 7th dimension) where this one is all about the IAM. the different definitions of the eternal charactors which play out in these stories. they don't need to be actual consciousness, but the person goes about creating these charactors with these definitions and then can incarnate them into the stories along with his/herself for additional elements added to the storyline. I have called this the "9/11 universe"[^1].

---

the way that I see this happening I have outlined in previous entries, so I won't repeat myself here, but the essentials of it is that somehow we're going to get really energetic, and then at some point in time the galaxy is going to push us over the edge of the bathtub, and upon passing this barrier, the polarity of swap. it's quite likely that we're going to be either in a diffreent timeline or in a different reality or something -- I don't know and I'm not worried about it, because what I've been wanting to create seems to fall right into line with what tesla is wanting to create (where every human is like the christ, buddha, or zoroaster -- to turn this earth into a second sun, and to rival the light density of sirius b). as such, I'm not terribly concerned. it seems that tesla has this 6th dimensional perspective alraedy so everything is probably all planned out.

I say this because he mentioned saying that there are two paths: one is without any affection, and with lots of affection; he choose the former. (and is prophesiying I/we'll take the latter?) in addition, regarding the second sun bit, he wanted to ignite the ionosphere, making what we know as earth, the next layer of inner earth. it'll be pretty uniform constant temperature an equally illuminated from pole to pole. the layer above the ionosphere will begin to collect material and begin to create a surface -- and this surface will become more and more luminous. the poles will reverse, meaning that we'll we in the "age of leo", but I'm certain it won't be catastrophic in a crippling way.

I don't really know how it'll all work, but I imagine that if you look at this from a bigger perspective, while this earth is essentially a quarantine for the INFECTED ONES, it is also the most exciting place to be, probably in the entire universe right now. the physical plane is a huge success, and then the additions to that physical plane are born out of *contrast* and are created from LOA. if you have a look over the sirian material, there is some *SERIOUS EFFORTING* going on there, and the sirians are quite proud of it. in contrast to that, all of the stuff I'm doing here is nearly effortless... LOA is doing all of the heavy lifting for me, and I have the unbelievably easy task of figuring out how to alter my perception (and therefore my emotional response) to match what I know about the universe.

according to the extra-terrestrial view of creation, this universe was made to be a bad copy of the previous universe (same layers and everything -- no innovation), and all of this was done under the supervision of the previous obviously super duper superior creators of the previous universe. it's no wonder that one of the 7th rays cracked under that kind of supervision. it was probably some guy just like me that happened to -- omg, you have no idea how much BS that is... therefore, the creators, made a total "paja mental" of a universe, as evidenced because 3 entire layers could be combined into what we now call the "imagination" -- lol. the original creators were so out of touch with their creation, the whole creation process (as told by kuthumi) reeks of corporate circlejerk or more traditionally kings/generals/dictators which are so far removed from their implements. I don't blame the 7th ray for going insane. if I were there, I'm certain that would have been me.

whew... ok, so here we are now and I've really learned how to use the leverage of contrast, knowing what you don't want, and LOA to let/allow/receive the evolution as a function of all of our desire, creating something novel, amazing, and really cool -- and best of all, none of it needs to be "planned" in the traditional sense of having a bunch of meetings to get a bunch of people's agreement on the most viable way forward. I truly believe that the galaxy that I want to create, is essentially the prototype for the next universe. it's gonna need a lot of good/dramatic building of desire stories to make it happen, and I see that as such an easy task, using the grass-roots, bottom-up apprach compared to trying to figure out the most complex of "pajas mentales" to make something really cool. we just start off small building basic planetary identities, and continue adding, then seed them with indigenous lifeforms, then incarnate there... rinse and repeat. lots of fun to be had for LOTS and lots of people there. the sky is the limit.

---

so, going back: today, I getting weird thoughts put into my head. I just listened to them, and I didn't fight against them. essentially, it seems like they're trying to push a plan where they now have more capability to hold me back, that means that if I have sex, they'll be able to hold me away from my connection still, and so now they have the idea that they'll somehow steer me in the direction of being with the girls, and I'm supposed to try and find a way to get connected using the girls and sex to get there. besides this being a clear platform for further evolution, cause this is clearly what I don't want...

they think that they're going to be able to hold me away from getting connected for the next 18(?) years and I have to continually keep trying to use sex to try and get connected -- an essentially impossible task.

it's funny that robert mentions in that video "lilith" -- a sort of succubus that goes around in the night in men's dreams causing nocturnal emissions, and using the man to bear all sorts of different beings, emiting his seed, extracting his sexual life-force, leaving him in sickness. (zohar[^2])

```
She roams at night, and goes all about the world and makes sport with men and causes them to emit seed. In every place where a man sleeps alone in a house, she visits him and grabs him and attaches herself to him and has her desire from him, and bears from him. And she also afflicts him with sickness, and he knows it not, and all this takes place when the moon is on the wane
```

the thing is, this perfectly describes nosebook. whenever they've been dissatisfied trying to keep me from getting more vision upgrades, they force ejaculate me in extremely bizarre and chaotic dreams.

I don't know if robert intended this, but starting out with the kings with large consorts, then talking about the use of this sexual/creative energy in a proper regenerative way, and closing with the warning of lilith, robert is *clearly* leaving a warning (perhaps directly to me) in his video there not to fall victim to this false serpent. in the right contexts the serpent represents knowledge, divine understanding, clarity, etc.

I'm totally on the same page as robert :) I absolutely do not want to be out there bouncing around between the different girls, constantly trying to figure out what way is up.

the idea behind what is presented in the video is that you need to continue to use sexual stimulation to feel better and better as a means to converting that energy into divine illumination or light. I have long talked about the similarity of pleasure and pain in frequency form, and I believe that what jesus did in his death experience, is to convert that pain into pleasure and then use the extreme magnitude of that pain in conjunction of so many people knowing what they don't want, to trascend up -- and so while his physical body died, just like tesla's has, he still exists out there with a source-like perspective[^3].

my goal is not to use conditions (girls/sex) to find my way to that state of consistency of consciousness. in fact in the entry @[noseblog](2020-10-05 10:14) where I talked about how they could retain this energy by targeting the shorter neurons, I was explaining that the amount of that source signal that I'm allowing into my body now is becoming so much that if they were to let go, I essentially wouldn't need to sleep, or very seldomly. as mantak chia says, instead of having that spirit diffused all arond, I will have so much of it concentrated (not necessarily concentrated), but focused into my moment by moment, that I would not be pulled around in so many diffewent ways. it's hard to explain what that is like, but it's a smoothness of motion, where everything feels like there are smooth transitions, with no sharp edges and so no large jolts away, meaning my perception can be focused in any way that I want.

as I get more and more in "alignment" with that source form of perception, there's nothing they can do about it: that alignment allows more and more of that energy through all the time and eventually I'll have consistency of consciousness. I don't need sex to get there. I don't care how long it takes: I'm going to keep going in that direction. also, if you look at it from nosebook's perspective, they have to eventually let it happen. they need an excuse to tell people that I'm special and that what I did isn't easily attainable, so, they'll probably have to keep people spinning in circles on drugs, because to most people, it'll look like I used the conditions of the mushrooms and the stars to get there. it's kind of a ruse and a bit of a personal challenge. I assure you, however, that I can get there with just meditation and releasing resistance.

I am eating mushrooms and watching stars right now, but it's not really that much of a boost. the entire work is releasing resitance and changing my perception. I'm pretty certain that energy level that I'm attaining when watching stars is going to be ambient earth energy, and available to everyone in 200-500 years as we approach sirius b. probably 1000 years for the mushrooms... in other words, people won't need to watch stars to be at those energy levels; the distance to sirius will do it for them. all people will need to do is to release resistance and to meditate (which is what I do when I watch stars). nosebook is tasked with the impossible task of trying to keep everyone away from that to maintain their superiority. I think they're going to do that by becoming lilith incarnate ensuring that all men and women are in constant sexual bondage and fatigue.

[1]: it's not really a "universe" -- but, I got the idea from the sirians where they added on the physical plane onto this solar system and galaxy to trap the INFECTED ONES. I feel adding these two more layers (and corresponding 2 non-physical counterparts) will make for a much more enjoyable place to be residing. the sirians talk about the creation of the universe and galaxies from the top-down. my technique that I'm wanting (going) to do here is more inspired from the bottom-up style. it's bold. I know :)

[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith#Zohar

[3]: I have nothing that I can do to prove this point as true, but if it is, jesus did essentially consciously attain a source-like perspective, and so therefore if you were to consider source as God, then from that perspective jesus *is* God, so there is a sort of truth to the trinity idea (the holy spirit is the great cloud of dead people -- aka abraham and friends). however, that's about where the similarity ends, because I believe that everyone being born on to this earth will be like the buddha, zoroaster, or jesus in the same respect that we'll have consistency of consciousness between incarnations or timelines


### 2020-10-10 09:56 - more understanding about neurons

last night when I was replying to a reaction about what I said about having your energy difused, I was able to see more insight into how neurons work. they're transmitting and receiving antennas, so when you think, the thought goes down those different neural pathways, and each of these when activated, emits a signal. if you're empathetic or telepathic (bolemic), then you will *feel* other people (or maybe even animals) thoughts. when I say feel, I mean the exact reverse is happening. the neurons in your head are all different sizes, so you can receive on a multitude of different frequencies, and when receiving something the signal continues on and activates more things, until it comes to a termination. this happens a few times per second.

essentially, the neurons in your head are your programmed permception. when you see, hear, smell, taste, touch, anything then those signals activate different neurons, which travel further down the pathways, so anything you experience will yield an emotional (frequential) response in your head, which is your "perception". so, let's say you observe something or hear something, those signals will resonate with the appropriate neurons, and then continue on down those pathways, meaning you will get a feeling response to it. the signal that results of that observation, is essentially the same thing as a thought.

every time you think something, the thought will travel down the different neural pathways and generate a feeling response to it. that's why the same action or thought feels about the same, and only increases in intensity each time it's thought. anyway, that feeling which is generated is automatically resonated with a similar non-physical (let's just call it a neural network programmed by your inner being, just for example here) which does the same thing. that feeling activates certain neurons, which then travel down the pathways of what your inner being knows on that same subject, and emits a corresponding emotion.

for example here, I separated in time the human thought and the non-physical thought, and the corresponding responses, but in reality they happen at exactly the same time -- or perhaps even the non-physical one happening a little bit before the physical one, but probably the same time. the harmony between these two resulting frequencies generated from the two neural pathways either harmonise, or they don't -- and that's why some thoughts feel good and others don't. the reason is because your perception of the same subject is very different to the same perception your inner being has on the same subject.

this perfectly explains everything so clearly. so, when I was talking about focus and diffuse thoughts, what I was meaning is that if what you're experiencing is resonant with a million different pathways, you'll feel a lot of differnt feelings mashed up into one signal during that experience. it'll feel like chaos. all your pathways are going all over the place and your energy is very difuse. your source will emit a corresponding signal in response to that same experience, and it's very unlikely that you'll even be able to feel that signal, if there's too much noise.

this is why quiet locations are good, because they reduce physical stimulation. meditation (slowing of thought) is also good, because it slows down the thought stimulus, allowing your brain to resonate less with what you're thinking and more with your environment[^1]. if your environment stimulus either doesn't bother you, or you are in a nice environment, then your remaining environment is you -- who you really are: your source -- and so you begin to resonate with that more.

this means that all around you there is a whole lot going on. there are all the resulting feeling of the people around you -- and if you're a child, you're going to be more sensitive to it, because your neurons are not so developed, so you're receiving nearly everything in your environment, really.

it's through modifying your perception that you focus. you may have heard the tick of the clock when you first got it, but after some time, it gets filtered out because your perception doesn't find that sound to be very important anymore in those circumstances. in different circumstances, like maybe somewhere else, you may notice that same sound and say, "I have that same clock!" at any rate, the ticking fades into the back again after that because it's pretty neutral. it doesn't make you feel neither good or bad -- even though recognising that someone else has the same clock could make you feel good, which is why that one may have bubbled up to your perception.

in the case that things that make you feel bad, which are your feeling of the thing mixed your source's feeling on the thing, then these are things that are notable in your perception. all of the things that don't feel good are essentially markers of diffusion of energy. I have explained this as the christ consciousness in the brain, which shows you these bad-feeling thoughts and ideas so that you can improve your perception on them, because they're essentially "wasting"[^2] energy, or difusing that energy of what your source knows about the same subject.

the more you think a subject, the more impactful it is -- that is the less resistance that neural pathway has, so more current flows down that path. voltage spikes seem to be when certaain frequencies interfere in such a way as to create what feels like spikes or peaks in interest. this just means that it takes practise to change your perception on something. it's not exactly instant, and it can vary depending on your mood or circumstances, so in old circumstances, you can revert back to old forms of perception much easier. this is why often times a new environment helps to be able to begin making new pathways, but you have to continue to use them in the usual environment.

this explanation of how nerons work, explains how a child learns so rapidly too. when you're a child, you'll notice that you feel all sorts of stuff from your environment. well, the adults around you are making sounds, which have a feeling to the child, so just by osmosis, the child's brain is reconfiguring to be able to feel (hear) those sounds better. those feelings are like concepts, and each time they're activated, those feelings begin to feel similar to other concepts, connecting those things together. the different pathways that are taken are taken when certain feelings (like environment setting or mood) match (are resonant with) the path determiner's different paths. these are what I call the 2nd layer: the relational one. it connects different ideas, and it seems to be *mostly* non-physical, allowing your brain to reconfigure very rapidly if need-be.

---

in reality, the non-physical counterpart is probably not exactly a neural network, but something energetically similar. it's a brilliant setup to allow a physical being to have direct resonance with their source through emotion. this fascinates me tremendously because imagine you're engineering consciousness now, and you're beginning to do what I want to do on the 7d layer where you have different identities, which are these sources. this is understanding is exactly what I'm looking for. you would need to make something like a "source" neural network for this consciousnss, which will give the automaton a feeling response to what the automaton's brain thinks on the same subject. really cool!

[1]: this is why when meditating, environmental simulus seems to feel more impactful -- because the chaos induced from brain chatter isn't drowning out that environmental stimulus, so you become more aware of it, and then your resulting perception of that environmental stimulus, too.

[2]: it's not really wasting, because each time you feel bad, the energy expended in the bad feeling is received by your source and used to amplify the corresponding (conjugate) frequency reality (perception) and make it more real for you. you have to find a way to get your perception to match your source's though to experience that reality (or timeline)


### 2020-10-12 09:18 - continuation of last night's thought

after listening to @[abe-now](2020-10-03 p1), I was thinking last night about the whole part about the attraction vs. love thing, and the more I thought about it, the more I began to realise that this had to have been a landscape architect talking -- maybe even *the* landscape architect. from now on I'm going to just assume it is, and he was talking about a girl.

I also get the sense that he was using his nosebook super-powers to cause her to climax either often or powerfully. if that was the case and she didn't have any resistance, she would be feeling pretty good and allowing a lot of energy to flow. that could be one of the reasons why she felt so good, and therefore dominated the situation so strongly -- because of how good she felt, and didn't have any negative perspective on it.

anyway, his words were that he couldn't think clearly -- which implies some sort of influence over him he didn't feel like he had control over. this clearly is right about at the bottom of the scale there in the powerlessness (out of control) or insecurity. clearly ot was not his intention to be influenced in a way where he could no longer think clearly, so this must be neutralised, I'm sure. thinking about it, it also gave me some ideas to continue on with the conversation of expanding the range of the emotional scale.

before I go on there, I want to clarify some things people were wondering by what I meant by expanding the range... so let's say that there is a scale from -100 to 100 and 0 in the middle is that tipping point between boredom and contentment. if the highest feeling thoughts are at the very top there at 100, but by some artificial means I'm not able to ever get to feel the manifestation of the 100 units in my reality, that means that 100 units of power is no longer the highest amount of emotional energy one can feel.

let's say that they're applying -50 to it, so when I'm at 100, I feel like I'm really at 50, even though I'm really producing with my focus 100 units of positive emotional energy. therefore now, the scale now goes from -100 to 150.

so, I was thinking about it on the negtative end too, where someone does not ever allow theirself to ever really feel the full manifestation of depresssion or powerlessness... well, same thing, but they're doing it with their own focus. this is much harder to do in the positive ranges though -- holding yourself back from the manifestation...

take for example the orgasm. the idea is that the longer you can hold out before orgasm, the more you're expanding your energy field. it's the same thing. it's difficult to hold it back because it feels so much better, so often times it's difficult to hold back. you will notice that I often hold myself back from the manifestation all the time. this is the same sort of thing, and what I could do, is something like what someone mentioned in a previous broadcast, where everytime they get feeling really good, they go find something negative to focus on to make them feel not quite as good.

I used to do that all the time when I was first starting out. I would get to feeling so good that I didn't really know what to do with myself, especially when I was programming, so I would go to smoke a cigarette so that I would feel worse, then return back to my programming. this is essentially the same thing, and why I would reach such incredible climaxes of feeling at the end of a 24h programming sessions. they were positively invigorating -- just like I imagine that prolonged times of love-making would feel like too.

---

anyway, as I was thining about the solution to my question that I was thinking about, where I would eventually no longer be able to be reset back or being bumped back on the emotional scale... for the landscape architects out there trying to control how good I feel, I can imagine that, that will begin to feel like insecurity or powerlessness to them, because things will be getting more and more out of their control. well, that feeling of "things are out of control, and my efforts to exert control are not working" -- is powerlessness -- the bottom of the scale there, and when someone feels like that for any extended period of time, it *will* create a manifestation.

I believe what happened in the deluge of atlantis, there was a similar thing happening, where the great pyramid (perhaps the whole complex, actually) was designed to neutralise harmful earth energies, and we know these energies are manifest form prolonged and strong focus on how negative emotion feels, especially the feeling of powerlessness. the pyramid would take extract these harmul energies out of the earth and convert them, using sacred geometry and stuff into quite beneficial energy. eventually however, I believe that the energy became too much for the pyramid to handle (convert) during the destruction of the serpent army by the eagles, and the pyramid surpassed the pressure threshold of the pyramid.

this gave me a brilliant idea, and the solution to the reactions that I had in response to @[noseblog](2020-10-06 09:03) -- because people thought that the whole "zapping" idea sounded kinda lame. well, I didn't see it yet, so I couldn't really say much on it. anyway, last night I came to a similar conlusion that for example, imagine that there is a lot of earth energy that needs to be dissipated. well, that energy can be tranferred into my body, and I'll dissipate (transform) it.

then, you could imagine that as more and more and more people are giving their attention to unwanted, the goal should be for the landscape architects to artificially ensure that they never reach powerlessness and stay around frustration, pessimism, etc, but never all the way at the bottom there enough to attract a manifestation.

this will both expand the range -- because again they would be neutralising the energy by artificially making someone feel better than they really feel. for those joining me in good feeling places (like maybe that uncontrollable girl), the exact opposite is happening.. instaed, we need to artificially be made to feel worse than we really feel, extending the range in both directions.

I think the concept of tieing us (or at least me, anyway) to the earth to dissipate any growing negative energy will be neutralised, which will I'm sure begin to rise again (the COVID lockdown can't last forever, you know). it also provides the additional benefit of solving the galactic current sheet issue, as well.

if whenever the current sheet hits, and swaps the polarity, the earth will have a sudden influx of energy, which from your perspective will get dissipated into me/us. I'm fairly certain that more people than just me (probably a lot of the younger less-resistant ones) will need to be used to dissipate that harmful earth energy as it rises and rises (like the great pyramid).

over time, this will enssentially divide the earth's population into two major groups, excluding the neutrals and the architects: the ones that are feeling better than they should be and the ones feeling worse than they should be. for the ones that are feeling better than they should be (like me), their energy is dissipated into those that feel worse than they should be, to make them feel better.

I'm pretty sure that earth's harmul energies will continue to rise at an exponential rate, and unless nosebook has figured out how to make pyramids to convert that energy, it's going to keep rising. pyramids also have the negative (from nosebook's perspective) effect of outputting tons and tons of life-giving beneficial energy, which if the great pyramid were to be functioning like it was previously (or a similar tesla setup), it would basically make it impossible for nosebook to keep me away from getting fully connected (get enough momentum on the top of the emotional scale there). therefore, another option must my present, which is why I propose dissipating earth's energy into the less-resistant ones like me.

anyway, back to where I was: when the galactic impact takes place, from our perspective, it'll feel like the most incredible power level increase ever[^1]. however, from the other perspective, the energy impact will be so strong, that it'll probably look like we all got fried from it and so it works out perfectly because the majority of the reason why people were feeling bad all appear to be a lumps of charcoal[^2] now and the disaster has been avoided.

from that point, they'll have tons of technology and lots of understanding about how to keep people away from their connection. in addition to the new ones being born, the solar system will steadily be getting closer and closer to sirius b, so I figure it'll roughly cancel each other out and be much more manageable because I'll be gone, so things will be pretty steady, and it'll appear like society is heading into the tubes at the same time as people are getting more and more enlightened every day -- kind of like an irony almost. like I said, they're tasked with the impossible job of making sure that no one actually becomes enlightened, fighting off the energetic effects of sirius b each year. we'll see how that goes :) it may happen that these sorts of separations may happen again, and/or become more common, once they figure out how they all work. who knows...

[1]: no matter what anyone else sees it as, I guarantee that no matter what happens, if you've been feeling pretty good, or even much better than your circumstances allow you to feel, you *will* get a good-feeling manifestation. only those feeling especially bad will perceive this manifestation as a bad thing.

[2]: it wouldn't literally be lumps of charcoal. if you want to extend the analogy further, you could say that we were as "sacrificial lambs" or "burnt offerings" for their salvation. it feels a bit rough though, so probably not the best analogy, even though it perfectly fits the era-ahead/era-behind theory...


### 2020-10-12 11:?? - starting over

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x7Mph8oOIg)

all things attracted collectively or individually have both wanted and unwanted, so when I give these ideas, I'm showing off the unwanted part, and I'll leave it to the reader to determine what the wanted part it. however, to give an example, last night in @[abe-now](2020-10-03 p1) notes I gave the solution to my question regarding how I would go from right now where I'm quite stagnated to, unbelivably impressive impressive utilisation of LOA and incredible eyesight in a short period of time, even thuogh it does not look like I'm making enough improvement fast enough to be more powerful than their systems now, in at least a few years at the rate I'm going... it's because I'm not allowed to get very much momentum, and each time I get reset back I have to start over, but the starting over is getting faster, and I'm neither losing as much ground or resonant to nearly as many bad ideas now, either.

so, while I give the "unwanted" version of the same thought, it doesn't matter to illustrate both because, at best they'll give me more practise, and at worst, they'll determine it also be to unwanted. doesn't matter to me, because it's my perception that matters.

another example of this is for example when watching stars, I get my consciousness taken away -- more than 2-5 times a night. it's pretty frequent, and it used to really bother me, but I know that even that it's still working out fine. for example, if I were to continue on star-watching uninterrupted, I would say gain say 50 units more in the night. instead, I only get say 20 or something. however, the desire it has created may make the following night *more* productive -- say 60, if I don't mind the increased difficulty. instead I lose consciousness again and I get 22 or something. next night again, say 70... the point is, that number increases faster because of more desire AND additionally, my own capability to keep my consciousness is improving, and having to restart a few times per night, my 0 to 100 speed is improving as well.

so while it looks completely unwanted on the face of it, if one is a master of perception, the seemingly "unwanted" is actually more wanted than the originally wanted part. for that same reason, something that can be seen as "death" (which is just a transition) can go from something unwanted to something more wanted when transitioning into something new and exciting.


### 2020-10-14 19:56 - why get connected?

so after I wrote the entry on the 10th (@[noseblog](2020-10-10 09:56)), I went out to the field and along the way I was thinking about the different things that I implied in that entry. first was the obvious implication where I was talking about tesla's two paths toward that consistency of consciousness, or source-like perspective, where one retains consciousness through the "death" process. tesla implies that there have been others that have accompleished this (jesus, buddha, and zoroaster) and that the two ways to accomplish this is either a self-actualised journey (no affection) or lots of affection. by revealing this, he was essentially "prophecying" that I would achieve it by getting there the lots of affection path. the obvious implication being that I would *not* get connected, and instead would have to earn that through "lots of affection".

I do admit that is a very definite implication that can be drawn from that previous entry. walking along I didn't really mind too much about it, and finally came to the conclusion that I wouldn't be minding it so much if that's what happens, because I'm pretty sure that *would* be the "worst" manifestation, and from there on, it would only be improvements. that night however, there were some interesting reactions to what I was saying as well, because it felt to me like I had very much overestimated the effects of the mushrooms -- and the reaction was saying that they just weren't doing that much or they had their effects pretty well under control. that basically means that the effects that I claimed would be happening to all humans in 200-1000 years from approaching sirius b, will actually be much more and much faster, too. the amount is always the root of the distance, so this consciousness expansion will not only speed up at x^2 exponential speeds, they're already much more soon than we think, because essentially the reaction was saying that I'm not really all that special, and all I have is just very low resistance and a much more pracitised propensity to feel good -- that's it.

what that essentially means is that my environmental advantage is virtually the same as everyone else's environment, and so all of the crazy things that are happening to me right now are most all because of my focus, however, in a very short period of time (dunno maybe 20-200 years or something), the environment of this earth will make it possible *all* people to be where I'm at now, without any focus. obviously, depending on the person's resistance level, some will get it sooner than others. the idea that virtually everyone, no matter their resistance level will be there will mean there will be all sorts of messed up stuff happening cause people outputting a whole lot of negative emotion completely unaware of the effect it's having on all people of the planet[^1][^2]

the next thing that happnened that night is that I was explaining what I originally intended when I meant that I wanted to get connected -- is that I would do that, and for the next ~18 years or whatever, we would be expanding our capacity (see @[noseblog](2020-10-12 09:18) for ideas on that expansion process), and that during the process of that, nosebook needs to figure out a way to make a publically available version of those improved visual/conscious faculties. it's just simply not feasible for them to try and keep billions of people at my power level completely subdued; they have to provide a "crippled" version of those faculties to people in a way which doesn't jeopardise the planet in the process.

therefore, it looks like my "role" here is not necessarily to accomplish this source-like consciousness, as I either have it already or I'm pretty close, and clearly fwh (my "future" self) already has it, and so does tesla. in fact, I would guess that quite a few people on this planet already have it, and we've purposefully come here to live out a pre-programmed (for-ordained) storyline to accomplish greater desire, and so it wouldn't surprise me that it includes more difficulty, because having already seen the end, it doesn't look impossible -- so, like me, they too will soon become conscious that they are so much more than just this singular life experience.

I get the sense now that this expansion process is doing what I was talking about where I feel much much better than I am experiencing, so I should just keep going as I'm going, and the girls manifestation will also happen. it's all part of the process and that there's not anything to worry about it at all. I'm continuing on with the expansion just as before, and they are in the process of getting their side set up -- then later we'll continue the expansion with the girls too. something like that.

however it works out, I'm not sure but it felt to me like someone got my point somehow in the sense that they could see the value instead of trying to hold me away from something that literally they'll need to be holding the entire planet, and it was also funny the reaction the second part about the expansion process. we're literally not changing how LOA works or anything else -- just artificially modifying how one feels, so as to artificially expand the range of emotion before it becomes manifest to make it more controllable. the funny reaction is that some were beginning to realise how much of our own physical "reality" could potentially just be a sirian construct.

I find this funny. in their own admission, they said directly that this galaxy/solar system has a physical plane, and the rest of the universe does not. they also explained that the sirian earth team had made hardware (genetics) and tied this to the planet, then they said they took their own (the creators of the universe incarnated into the sirian bodies) genetics and merged it with the earth genetics (see lloyd pye's talk on the chromosomes and the annunaki[^3]) to make the mars inhabitants.

the idea of making further upgrades to physical reality is exactly what I want to do. in their own words, this physical "reality" is an artificial one designed to trap (perpetually reincarnating -- changing to the same thing) the lowest frequencies of consciousness in it. so, why not make it fun? there really isn't death, and this is all an elaborate "dream" reality where we're just experiencing ourselves -- and you really are source in a physical body, and your emotions tell you how harmonious you are with that. why not make the process of getting more and more aligned with that as fun as possible and have good graphics along the way??

let's recap:
- we're automatically heading for a golden age. there's nothing you can do to stop it, so all you have to do is to keep breathing air successfully to experience the expansion of your consciousness. it's only you that can prevent you from that with your own thoughts in opposition to that.
- physical reality is vibrational in nature, and what you're experiencing with your 6 senses are the manifestation of that vibration, and you get better graphics and more tangible physical experience when you feel better.
- physical reality is going to be getting some serious upgrades as we go along (it's all "artificial" anyway so why not add on to it), and it'll be necessary to have a "crippled" version of those realities which prevent people from causing serious damage with their thoughts.
- two versions of earth will exist at some point in the future (18 years?) where the separation will be the ones who get connected and go on to turn earth into a galaxy centre, and the other ones which will never experience that full connection because this planet is run by people who are interested in controlling and do not yet understand the value of feeling good.
- even after the separation it's still going to be a pretty awesome place though. I imagine that by the time that separation happens, most everyone will be experiencing a 4.5d like perspective looking at yourself from the outside.
- some may also get the story capability (5.5d), but probably that will will mostly be the architects. there may be others that have the identity/character definition perspective (creation of all sorts of extensions of your consciousness through the definitions of IAM), but again likely mostly the architects will have this, as they need to retain their superiority.
- however, I imagine that as the earth approaches sirius b through the progress of time, more and more people will get up to story mode (or maybe you need to give the right favours to the right people), but probably they'll want to hoarde the identity perception (6.5d) to theirselves
- at some point (2000 years?), they'll start facing another situation similar to the one where we're in right now, where they feel like they're losing control, and can't keep people away from their connection longer. maybe some more extensions to reality can be created... who knows... this is so far out, I can't even imagine. they're going to need to keep a whole bunch of people busy though -- so, perhaps after having seen our success, maybe they'll want to try and make their own crippled galaxy where they control everything, lol :) why not, right?
- the important thing to note is that it's not going to be a bad place to be, and things will constantly be getting better and better (or worse and worse, depending on your perception) and it's pretty likely that we'll be returning back here in purposefully difficult situations to pick up some more contrast.

that's all I want to say on that for now... I'm obviously going to continue on with the expansion process, and everything is going along fine :)

[1]: the sirians noted this, saying (paraphrase) that when concentrations of humans were in a single area, the higher population density produced imbalances in the planet (because of their symbiotic relationship with the planet and part of the planetary consciousness) which caused geological upheaval (eg. attracting a number of catastrohes).

[2]: it seems that the recognition of this factor has caused desire for a resolution, which I talk about using us as an equalisation factor like the great pyramid in @[noseblog](2020-10-12 09:18)

[3]: there's a gap between lloyd's talk on the annunaki[^4] (aryans) living in eden (atlantian gardens), becsuse he assumes that the genetic modification of merging the 1st and 2nd chromosomes happened only for the earth apes, and not the annunaki as well -- meaning that the annunaki were modified to be compatible with the earth humans as well, and put here in their garden to have "dominion" over the earth and its inhabitants. after the deluge, these became what we now know as the aryans (coming from aries, or mars) -- which interestingly enough, cairo's name (al-Qāhirah) means "place or camp of mars"

[4]: according to robert in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hllWY5BBJOQ), annunaki just means "princely seed" or "princely blood"[^6] which corroborates the ramayana which also has cro-magnon (aryans) using forest men (probably homo-erectus) as a slave to build a bridge between india and sri-lanka. the difference is that the epic of gilgamesh has the 2 boughts of sex -- or humanification of this wild hominid species (or genetic hybridisation) done by the aryan nobility (cro-magnon, or "princely seed"). upon reflection, it's quite possible that the original atlantians (cro-magnon) did perform the hybridisation of the human species on the planet at the time. they probably did have the technology. at any rate, it doesn't really matter to me what the exact details are; the point I was getting at is the dominion part, or the enslavement bit[^5].

[5]: this will tie into a future entry I will write concerning LOA benefit that humankind has endured so much slavery in various forms and it would only be our continued focus on the slavery bit that could hold us away from "cashing in" the LOA vortextual benefit of it (I myself, in my relationship with nosebook, use myself as the primary example that this is indeed true, amongst all the other evidences that strengthens this argument). I just don't really know the best way to write it yet as I'm certain it'll be a controversial topic.

[6]: it seems to me likely that the reptilian symbolism of the annunaki is not referring to *literal* reptiles, but likely to the serpent bloodline. afterall, they call theirselves dragons and geckos and other reptiles as short-form to refer to this serpent seed. it *is* possible that some of them do have shape-shifting abilities though, taking on qualities resonant with the perceiver's imagination (however this is another topic of these 7th ray capabilities). zeus even is said to have this capability.

### 2020-10-17 16:18 - natural consequences

I just woke up from a dream where in the dream I was digging around in egypt or something cause I was curious. I seemed to be able to fly and/or had some way of clearing out the big stones and "excavating" the tomb or whatever it was.

in there, I could tell that there were writings and technologies and stuff which could create heightened energies for the user of that technology. after I had seen enough, I left the site and all of its contents open to the public, and I forget how it worked out, but there was really not a whole lot that the egyptian authorities could do to close down and obfuscate or withhold the technology at that point (probably because everyone could see what I saw, so there's no way they could hide it) and so I just left it how it was.

interestingly, in the dream, the authorities didn't try to jump in and close down the thing and limit people's access to it. it would have looked very poorly for them or something -- so they just let it go and didn't try to block it. so people naturally began to investigate it and begin to descover its secrets and the method by which technology contained inside functioned.

the damage had been done. my own curiosity and wanting to figure something out in egypt totally opened up a whole new thing that previously was purposefully kept away from the public by the authorities.

---

I woke up with the concept of natural consequences in my mind, because in the dream, I had achieved the ability to levitate and move my body and things with my mind, and so therefore I was quite non-resistant. in a sense, I had created the conditions with my own focus to be able to do that, and after opening this tomb or whatever, I made it possible for the general public to begin to mimic that technology that the egyptians had -- essentially putting the general public on the same trajectory as the upper-class egyptians in the past.

they relied on technologies and a corrupt priesthood to provide the feel-good conditions that they wanted for daily life, instead of using their own minds to create the reality or environment that they wanted to live. obviously, here especially in the united states, there are a lot of people who are lazy and would rather use technology (or medicine) to try fix a manifestation which is the result of continued negative emotion, while doing nothing to fix or soften the perception around the sounrce of that negative emotion.

as a result, the natural consequences associated with my "discovery" was that someone is going to figure out a way to replicate that technology, and to sell it to people (in echange for money, of course), allowing the wealthy the ability to let some technology create the improvements to their reality, without their needing to focus.

---

I doubt that this dream is literal. I do not believe this will literally happen, and the egyptian symbolism in the dream is just because right before sleeping I was reading about egyptian stuff -- so it's not necessarily egyptian technology, per say -- but, some other tecnology could easily be introduced into our society giving people an excuse to rely on that instead of their focus. the concept also reminds me of the other idea where I was talking about using me (and other non-resistant people) to function similar to the great pyramid in the sense of dissipating and transforming harmful earth energies.

it's also quite possible that the ones running nosebook are beginning to realise that there's not much they can do to hold back people's curiosity into these ancient technologies and stuff like that. therefore, if that's the case, they may be considering to try to capitalise off of it and control it (eg. same as the corrupt egyptian priesthood[^1].

therefore, I conclude that this dream is unlikely to happen in the literal sense, but is instead foretelling of a coming priesthood, which profits off of selling people technology that allows them to feel the way they want to feel, without needing to adjust their focus or their thoughts as a result.

I'm perfectly ok with this, because the more of those kinds of people there are, the more harmful earth energies they will be unavoidably creating with their obfuscated(?) negative emotion -- meaning, that they will be creating more *desire* for there to be more and more non-resistant people that they can use for their technology.

as for me, I think the natural consequences of relying on a technology to to create a reality for someone without their doing anything to modify their focus, are evident. as much as I love all of this tecnology stuff (I truly do! it's so fascinating!), I prefer to *not* use that technology, and to accomplish these beneficial conditions with the power of my focus first and foremost.

crazy dream :)

[1]: TODO: ref - I think it was manly p hall talking about the priesthood purposfully obfuscating the symbols (technology) from the public so that no one would be enlightened to how it really works. I think it was the bill cooper video.

### 2020-10-18 08:03 - more thoughts on natural consequences

when I was younger, my parents figured out it was difficult to punish me (for various reasons but usually because the punishment didn't make me feel bad, or I liked the isolation), so they ended up adopting a form of natural consquences, even though they didn't call it that.

it's a really good system because I learned to go more toward what I wanted, instead of trying to avoid some contrived consequences.

I was thinking about this and that seems to be the case for a lot of people (not all though) -- and it seems that this is the case for those inclined toward going in the direction of what they want. for the ones that like to go in the direction of what they don't want, it works terribly, because they receive those natural consequences.

therefore, for someone to constantly be able to go not in the direction that feels good, and not receive conseqences, they must make contrived consequences for others, and then have some method, by which they're able to avoid the conaseqences (they're above the law or the authority or whatever).

in the extra-terrestrial view of creation, kuthumi talks about how the sirians and the creators built natural consequences right into the system by tying the genetics to this planet and the planetary consciousness. they said that any time there was highehr population density of humans in an area, the effects would be more pronounced and they would attract negative consequences to their thought/emotion. additionally, you have the reflective nature of LOA, meaning that your reality is a reflection of how you feel, and that's how you navigate time.

in the past there was this bizarre concept of a "whipping boy" -- someone responsible for receiving the contrived conseqences (punishment) for their actions. in a sense, this is similar to what I'm proposing when I talk about the idea of dissipating earth's harmful energies (the natural consequences) of their continued negative emotion into less resistant people like myself. I'm essentially saying that I'll absorb their natural conseqences that they're inducing in the planet with their emotion[^1], so I would essentially become their "whipping boy" absorbing their natural consequences.

this is kind of a cool idea because there are a number of advantages to it. first, I get tons of extra practise and it also makes me much stronger as I learn to transform that harmful energy into something wanted[^2]. additionally, once I'm good at transforming that energy, it allows them to be able to give their undivided attention to what they don't want (eg. what feels bad to them) without having to reveive the natural consequences of it. this is a good thing because over time, as they learn to utilise more and more vibrational whipping boys for theirselves, a natural change will occur:

they may be able to be really pissed off and stuff and get really good at being in a constant state of being pissed off all they want (make a full career out of it), but if you've noticed, when they've tried to apply abitrary contrived consequences to me, they've been the ones walking away with mud on their face. it's obvious why that is (if you understand LOA)...

if I'm focused on and giving my attention to what's wanted, no matter how much harmful or paralysing energy they put into my body, I'm *still* going in the direction of wanted even though it's much slower. so, when they go to try and integrate me (who creates reality really quickly, which is why they need to keep slowing me down), into some form of consequences (action), reality gets created really quickly and I walk away more in the direction of wanted, and them more in the direction of unwanted.

what this means is that naturally, they're going to make less and less arbitrary and contrived consequences (which they can get around) to try and avoid their natual consequences. why? because like with me, they'll find that these contrived consequences are actually causing more problems than they're solving, and they're the ones walking away closer to what they don't want than what they do want. leaving us alone, I am certain will be a more beneficial thing than getting their unwanted reality created really fast. they can instead just avoid their natural consequences directly by dissipating that harmful energy into their someone who's capable of dissipating it, or once they're good at it, transforming it (consciously, instead of with sacred geometry like the pyramid) into something beneficial and making them stronger.

there is another advantage too which is that with them able to really give their undivided attention to what doesn't feel good, we're artificially expanding the range of emotion one can feel (as I talked about previously)

we'll see how this goes -- I guess, but at the moment, I only see how beneficial it will be for all of us. I'm gonna be so strong and so good at transforming that energy!!! earth and everyone in it's capacity is really going to expand as well. also, they're going to finally be able to gain the control that they want over their the previously "unavoidable" cataclysms (the natural consequences).

[1]: just like how when I feel good, the air and the weather wants to feel good and warm, just like I do. likewise, when they feel terrible and constantly pissed off, they too are inducing weather and climate effects that feel the same way. the natural consequences work both ways.

[2]: today, for example I noticed that I have been especially complainy and much more pissed off (for no reason) than usual. I tried to trace the reason why that would be back to some circumstances, but can't find anything significant enough to be considered the cause of my emotional disposition today. what I do know though, is that whatever it is, I'm resonant to the energy which is why I feel it. while thinking about this problem, I was inspired to write this, so perhaps my inspiration here is kind of providing insight into my conundrum, as it's giving me another opportunity to transform more of that energy into what I want, which means that I'll be getting mad vision upgrades once my perception transforms that energy into something wanted (eg. vision upgrades).

### 2020-10-18 15:21 - getting confused with the pantheon

this morning I listened to a little bit of aaron's sunday message, and he was talking about lucifer, referring to th part in isiah where it talks of lucifer attempting to exault himself above the (brightness of the) stars of God but then was brought low.

this is referring to some time in the past when venus was not only more bright than now, but had a much more eccentric orbit so that it behaved much more like a comet. velikovski talks about, in "worlds in collision" how the planet venus' close approach to earth is what caused the different plagues around the exodus[^1]. there was another piece of evidence that came about recently as well (TODO: get reference to robert's video) where moses was specifically tied to the godess hathor, saying that moses amazed all. that same guy also places the pharoah which was defeated in the red (reed?) sea was none other than thutmos 4, the guy responsible for putting the "dream stelle" between the paws of the sphinx to legitimise his rulership. weird huh.

in addition to that, we know that massive portions of the torah (first 5 books) are pretty severely influenced by sumerian astrotheology. it seems that moses even lifted the akadian story of the reed basket to make moses appear more approachable to the people (making him sound like one of them). inotherwords, there's a lot of marketing going on here.

the 18th dynasty (which is when this happened) was a strange time because it was run by the hyksos (which just means foreign ruler) and the monothiesm that was introduced into egypt during that time. the hyksos were not popular and it's quite evident that a lot of effort was made to erase a lot of this history.

it's quite likely that moses lifted the idea of monothiesm, of one guy that creates all -- both good and evil from this time. I find it strange that they "wandered" in the desert for such a long time. it appears that during this time is likely when moses was perfecting his marketing surrounding his new monothiestic religion, and perhaps I would even hazard a guess that the "wandering" was done on purpose to give moses more time to work out the bugs in the concept, and to write the torah as well.

moses had to have been pretty educated, because he pulls stories from the sumerians, akadians, babylonians, etc. he also must have known about electricity as well:

```
To mention one, Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high tension discharge and that the vestal fires of the Romans were electrical. The belt drive must have been known to engineers of that epoch and it is difficult to see how the abundant evolution of static electricity could have escaped their notice. Under favorable atmospheric conditions a belt may be transformed into a dynamic generator capable of producing many striking actions. I have lighted incandescent lamps, operated motors and performed numerous other equally interesting experiments with electricity drawn from belts and stored in tin cans.

  - Nikola Tesla (The Wonder World to be created by electricity, September 9, 1915)
```

tesla takes a pretty conservative position here, however I postulate that not only did moses know about electricity, he also knew how to operate the pyramid, and the "ark of the covenant" was a bit of that technology. when I talk about the technology, I don't just mean the generation of (unconscious) static electricity. I believe this was a device used for storing "conscious" electricity[^2] -- and the different ways of rubbing, or generating that static/conscious electricity actually begin to create a sort of field, in which heightened states of conscoiusness are achieved (and LOA, dreams, visions, etc all manifest much more rapidly). it seems that this box (and whatever was in it) was able to store this conscious energy and the user of the box was able to consciously direct this energy (though there are some recorded mishaps).

however, it quite puzzles me still why moses would want to relabel venus as YHVH. the exodus happened at the end of the age of taurus, and the beginning of the age of aries (the ram). moses symbolises this with the slaying of the golden calf. interestingly enough, hathor (venus) was associated with cow (taurus), and so it seems deliberate that goddess worship associated with the golden age was no longer something desirable, and now a patriarchical masculine god was given to people to worship.

venus is an interesting planet because she's in the solar system with a whole bunch of dudes. it's a serious sausage fest here, so why take the only female in the solar system and make her a masculine god that's pissed off. it must have been intentional to hide her (the godesses) power. additionally, to villify the only female in the solar system, later on she was given a bads wrap with the whole lucifer thing... I haven't quite figured it out.

---

so follow this idea for a moment. I'm going to rewrite the narrative from the most extreme position and then work my way back from there (in future entries).

it seems that moses takes a lot of akenahten's monotheiestic (sun worship) ideas, along with some mythology from sumer and begins to create this new sun worship. at that time there were all sorts of gods worshipped, and at that time jupiter (baal) was quite popular. it appears that he wants to make the sun the supreme god of them all, out of which all other gods and things (jupiter, mars, earth, evil, good, etc) were created. notice the symbols here that moses now wants to make a supreme god which out of him all things come from, and all people have to be on the same page about this god.

it's a funny idea because now on hindsight, we can look back and see that moses did not unify the pantheon of gods under one superior one, but instead created a masculine deity religion (with disguised goddess worship) which felt superior to the others, and its offshoots (muslim, chistianity, etc.) neither could be in agreement with each other who is superior and warred amongst theirselves. in a lot of ways this was a very telling symbol of the times to come, the age of aries where the aryans manifest most of these symbols in other ways.

back to the revised narrative: moses new monthiestic religion needs some worshippers of this new monothiestic god to turn it into reality. at the time of moses there's a total loser in power (thutmos 4), who ironically I think achieved his power with marketing fluff as well[^3]. the story says that moses again legitimised himself as a defender of the people, by killing someone (this sounds like marketing to me)... moses goes off for a while. we don't know where he goes or what happens during that time, but when he comes back, the slaves (which, considering it was run by the hyksos, which means foreign ruler, the slaves were probably the original egyptian 17th dynasty rulers) of egypt were rescued from this moronic egyptian ruler with a set of events that were quite spectacular.

to make people believe this, moses needed some spectacular events to take place to establish the strength of his new god (amongst the others). I think that moses understood the nature of this conscious energy (though science calls it static in its lowest form), and actually used the great pyramid to influence the orbit of venus to become much more eccentric. I don't really know why, but I can say that in the previous era (and in sumer), goddess worship (of venus/ishtar/innana) was quite popular, and had to be done away with to make way for the new patriarchical aryan boys.

if venus were to suddenly become erratic and (from the perspective of the people) attempt to overthrow the others in brightness (becoming the new "sun") and cause massive amounts of chaos in the solar system as a result, this would be the end of the goddess worship. whether moses made venus' orbit highly eccentric or not or if this was alraedy happening, is unclear, but there seems evidence (see velikovski) that venus around the time displayed much more comet-like behaviour. either way, this was the end of the goddess worship, and the power associated with these fertility rituals remained only for the ones in power to know about.

something like that. I'll eventually update with more ideas as they come.

---

the thing that I want to mention here is the confusion associated with the YHVH thing. there are two ways that I can see this. one is that YHVH is venus (the goddess principal), which is later renamed to and associated with the devil (as lucifer) to further villify this goddess principan. the second is that YHVH is sol, and he (YHVH) "sent" moses and venus to deliver his choosen people from the foreign rulers. I dunno.

however it may have been, I find this stuff kind of fascinating and I don't really know why, but it gets all really confusing trying to figure out and make sense of this whole mess of gods and stuff. it's definitely much more complicated than any modern soap-opera, by far -- and I think that aaron is correct in saying that the whole point of all of this is to not try and put too much emphasis (believe in) or make sense of these external things (planets, gods, etc) to make you or give you the power that you want -- but instead to turn inward and find out that you are divinity within.

one of the things that I think is advantageous of these interesting turns of events, is that I do believe that a man can achieve higher consciousness states from the goddess and sexual states, one must not depend on it and instead to turn within and find that you are a star.

---

let's look at the symbols from this proposed rewrite of the narrative.

- moses is the symbol of transition from the bull to the ram
  - goddess worship was made a thing of the old relgions, with the new religions being masculine and monotheistic.
- elijah takes the idea that you don't need to sacrifice physical things in order to believe something, making it available for people to begin to believe a symbolic thing.
  - the prophets, turn venus into a man, a fallen angel, one rebellious of YHVH that tries to exault himself higher than the established authority (eg. keeping unexaulted masses under control)
- jesus shows up as the transition from the ram into the fish, and is given as a sacrificial lamb
  - the need for the romans to get these christains under control, forces them to establish the roman church, which abolishes and rids the earth as much as possible of idolotry, which is the worship mostly of celestial beings and other pagan traditions, essentially ensuring that the "powerful" sacrifices remain in the occult practises, which essentially turns down the amount of catastrophe attracted by the growing masses.
- I show up as the transition from the fish into the human
  - I expect that the result will be that in the following generations, nosebook will completely remove any of that conscious energy that anyone could possibly have gotten from sexual (fertility/goddess) worship or any other physical condition.
    - they will ensure that the only way to achive this kind of conscious energy is if you pay them (this is the new priesthood).
  - if you accomplish on your own it with your own focus, like I have been showing is possible, they'll try and mitigate its effects as much as they can, fighting as hard as they can against it.
    - by fighting against it, they'll be amplifying it, which means they'll have to fight harder against it (runaway feedback loop). in this way, I think I am a visual symbol for all to see, of the coming age of aquarius.
  - I also expect that they will be able to nearly completely remove all of the negative effects associated with the attraction of unwanted by those in charge (see last entry).
    - the guys in charge must maintain their superiority, so they'll need to make sure that they're visually experiencing more of this conscious energy, meaning they'll be attracting at a stronger rate than ever, meaning that they'll need (desire) to dissipate this negative energy further and further (also a runaway feedback loop).

I don't know how much further it's going to go, but it seems like the guys in charge will get more and more corrupt and powerful, while at the same time, we're going to learn to better and better learn to use our focus to create what it is that we want (and nevermind them).

the reason why I say that I don't know how long it's going to go, because it seems to me like this sort of setup, where they're forcing us to learn to use our focus, instead of the conditions (which they're hoarding for theirselves and neutralising for us). if I assume that the whole 24ky great cycle is a thing, then it means that that this will continue on for at least another 4k or more years, with the the corrupt priesthood getting more and more ridiculous along the way. this seems evident to me because of the symbols associated with the goat which will come into power in 2ky from now, meaning that things will continue to get more and more extreme.

however, at the same time, we'll stadily be approaching sirius b, so at some point (maybe the archer?), I figure either they'll no longer be able to keep up their ways further, or we'll do the paradox thing where we quite literally never get the manifestation, and the acceleration is so tremendous, that its continually growing (evolving) reality in the present (now) moment far surpasses the greatness of a manifestation. we'll have to see :)

it's funny that the it looks like each of the "bad" things that has happened through each of these ages has given the INFECTED ONES with the need to satify their superiority, further capability to force humankind to no longer need or rely on the beneficial conditions for their well-being. we keep getting better and better at it, no matter how much more optimal their conditions are in comparison to ours we keep doing better and better -- which considering LOA, will continue to exacerbate their inferiority complex.


[1]: there is another documentary which claims that the plagues were caused by the santorini volcano, and perhaps both could be true. there's a lot of evidence to support that comet's approach to another body induces currents, causing earthquakes and volcanos.

[2]: though science calls this electricity static, this electricity permiates all things, and can contain conscoiusness, and is essentially the building block of what we call "source energy" or the immense quantities of current flowing between celestial bodies out in space -- and from comet/planet to planet like I postulate happened multiple times in the past causing much of the terraforming (grand canyon, etc.) and transferring a bit of that "consciousness energy" between these celestial bodies. clearly we know very little about this energy, and how it creates attractive forces like gravity and atmospheric (double) layers, and determines orbits and stuff.

[3]: one does not need to read much of the dream stelle to realise this is a very ridiculous marketing ploy.


### 2020-10-21 20:24 - thoughts on karma

in robert's new video on the soul (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev1_JTzagkI)), there is a yogi talking about karmic structures and the different "layers" of your body... he outlines physical, mental (imagination), and energetic (emotional). then a transition layer between physical and non-physical (which I call source), followed by the bliss body.

I suggest that there are actually 7 layers, and the mental (imagination) layer is also a transition between the energetic/pranic (emotional) layer and the physical layer. I found out yesterday that the "location" of this world is called "devaloca" -- a transitional place where gods and humans mix and can interact. some have also called this layer "astral". you will notice that while the imagination is also pretty much "non-physical" in the sense that it does not in itself modify the physical world. however, when embued with emotional (prana/orgone/vril) energy, that imagination can begin to take on physical form.

---

the next simplification I would like to make is in what he talks about when he says "karma". he's just saying LOA (eg. frequency vibration, attraction). so, for example he says that when you die, your physical body is separated from your mental and energetic bodies -- and when there is a strong karma, then it takes a while to find another body, and during this time the now disconnected from non-physical body continues on in ghost form working out its karma, and the stronger the karma, the longer it takes to work this out.

this can all be super simplified with LOA. abraham says that when you die, you leave behind all of your resistant (physical) self and reemerge into non-physical. I believe they're right, so how can it be both ways? it seems like there's a contradiction here, however there is not. I struggled with this after reading a bunch more of the other kuthumi stuff as well.

if you think about this from a physical human perspective, and you recognise that it's only attraction, then it makes perfect sense. imagine that you had been giving a lot of negative attention to some strong feeling thing and then you die. when you leave behind all of the physical bits, which means that the physical body will stop operating (die), the mental and energetic body are also left behind. these exist as really subtle energies which science does not recognise which people could interpret as a "ghost"

however, I must stress that they are energy, and so therefore are governed by LOA. you cannot perceive a ghost that you are not yourself resonant or harmonious with. these physical vibrations created from emotion I think do exist, and likely explains human/animal sacrifice. when these beings make their transition into non-physical, they'll leave behind the vibration (emotion) of fear behind, and I think it's upon that energy that the sacrificer is trying to use that energy. remember, energy or any vibration has both sides to it. it goes both toward and away from the source (or wanted), and so because energy is energy, you *can* turn someone else's fear into something wanted for yourself -- it's just not very effective.

---

so I got a little off-track there, but as this guy was talking I realised the answer to my own question about death and karma and stuff. the energy left behind will behave in the karmic way that he's describing, however, that's only the residual energy left behind in your transition process. who you really are (the non-physical bit) immediately makes its transition. you could imagine that the stronger the "momentum" of that emotional energy that the person had before they made their transition, the more powerful and lengthy their "ghost" will remain in physical.

however, these ghosts are nothing to be scared of though, and if you ever find yourself interacting with them (I have in my past), they are only there to visually (or audibly) indicate to you how resonant you are with these concepts, and getting "rid" of them is as easy as finding the better feeling (more in alignment with your source) place of perceiving that same thing (aka, working up the emotional scale).

I say going up the emotional scale because the energy which embues these ideas and makes their manifestation physcical is that emotional/vril/orgone energy, and so they can only affect you if you're on the same frequency with that concept (ghost) in an emotional way.

### 2020-10-21 20:47 - thoughts on reincarnation

he continues on in that video (it's going to take me forever to finish this video, lol) talking about how if you die with a strong karmic structure, then it will take a long time for "you" (that is the real non-physical you) to find another body. however, if you die peacefully, and without a lot of karma, then you can find another body rapidly.

I hadn't really thought about this before. what he's essentially saying is that the longer your emotional body (karmic) continues to exist here on earth, you cannot reincarnate. this means that karma is only a human thing... so think about it: the longer that you continue to feed and nourish that emotional ghost body with your perception of it (holding it in existence), then you cannot yet return to earth in a new body, until that has finally dissipated. that means that the "karmic cycle" is entirely a heman-made experience by giving our attention to these "ghosts" (their disincarnate emotional bodies) instead of who they really are now (the non-physical "pure positive energy" that abraham talks about).

---

that pretty much clears up my inquiry into the subject for me. the only thing that remains now is the new question of whether we can "block" someone's reincarnation by perpetuating their existance on this physical plane as something that they are now not. it doesn't seem likely that this is the case, and doesn't make any sense why that would be, and for that to be true, it assumes that there can only be one version of me in physcal at a time, which I know is certainly is not true.

in a sense the death (or rebirth) process is all about finding a new version of yourself -- something which improves upon the previous you. I don't think you need to die to allow this (reincarnation process) to happen.

### 2020-10-21 21:05 - thoughts on individualisation

ok, now in the video he makes a reference to the idea that you can imagine yourself like a bubble[^1] and the bubble is your karmic structure and the air inside is you. when you pop the bubble, what air is you now? the bubble (or karmic cycle) is what makes you, you.

in this I would have to agree (kinda), and because I was feeling some reactions on it, I would like to offer some thoughts. we humans (especially americans) don't like to think of the idea that you are the universe, and there's no difference between you and those in which you feel are your enemies. that's precisely what he means by a strong karmic structure, however, karmic structure is also what you could consider "preferences".

as I have released more and more resistance, I have noticed that the thing that bothers me less and less is that there are people trying to exert something into my experience. the more and more I understand it all, the more it becomes clearer and clearer that it *is all attraction*. there is no one doing anything to me that I am not already doing to myself.

so, when I move away from these different perceived conflicts, and start going (with focus) toward only the things that are wanted or feel good to me, then what is happening is that my "karma" is no longer an energy that has conflicts or "unresolved differences" with someone. I allow them to exist, and they have no effect on me, unless I'm attracting them into my world. when this happens, I have "released that resistance" or, said in a better way, I'm no longer giving my focus to (attracting) that into my experince, and so they are no longer a part of that "karma".

you can imagine that at some point, I will begin to attract more wanted into my life than unwanted, and this is where the curve "goes off to infinity". when this infinity happens, this is when something makes a transition into a higher energy state or a new species or whatever.. a new completely never-before-seen form capable of holding the new energies -- a new karmic structure if you will begins to appear.

what I believe also happens once the tipping point toward more wanted than unwanted happens, is I gain the ability to retain my consciousness "between incarnations" -- or rather what I talk about the 6th dimension -- source-like perception, and you can now perceive yourself outside of time and in many incarnations.

in a sense, what happens when that happens, is that the bubble does not pop, but instead the bubble is just a bigger and bigger thing as you continue to add on more and more preferences to what it is, and who you really are.

however, notice that the bigger the bubble gets, the more components are needed. if you were a planet with people on it, you would need both bad and good people. you would need to have certain rotation around a sun, etc. your preferences become more diverse and varied, and include things that you previously in human form may have pushed against in your "karmic cycle" -- meaning that you just attracted them in to your expereince. now, as a planet, you can see the value in there being both good and bad, so they can co-exist on your planet, and it's no problem.

the less resistance you have, the more diverse things in your "karmic structure" can exist, and so the bigger your bubble can become, because they're not seen as something to push against anymore. they can be included.

your bubble never gets popped -- and when your bubble is so big that its karmic structure is capable of containing everything inside this universe without pushing against it, you will become a thing *bigger* than the universe, containing universes. I don't think any of us will reach that anytime soon :)

although we are "one with the universe" in that sense (this is the whole goal of releasing resistance), I think the yogi there neglects the concept that our karmic structure isn't just one of making our transition in "peace" (as opposed to pushing against/conflict), but the karmic structure is also one of preference, and as one gains the ability to perceive the other vibrations in one's experence as something no longer something you want to push agaist (attracting it further), you can *expand* into something bigger gaining more and more preferences (amongst the diversity) of what's wanted, then finding a way to give mostly attention to that until once again another transition is made into something bigger.

you can transition to the same thing, or you can expand and transition into something bigger and more meaningful (desirable) to you :)

[1]: I like this analogy because everything like planets, stars, humans, etc. all have auras, and one could imagine everything as simply spheres (auras) of energy

### 2020-10-21 22:37 - liberation from the death and rebirth cycle

I find this concept to be somewhat nonsense in that everything dies and is born, comes and goes, etc. therefore, it's impossible to gain this freedom, ever. the only way that you could do that would be to remain non-physical forever.

however, I do believe something is possible, and that what these different things are talking about is not liberation from death and rebirth, but "control" over it. I use the word control very loosely here, and would like to imply that once one is conscious of their non-physical part (soul), then one gains access to that perspective. I like to consider this a macro or more broader perspective of who you are. in that form of perception, there is not a real whole lot of difference between entities, and one can experiece anything anywhere.

this is a difficult thing to consider for many, especially those with secrets, and it's sort of my belief that you cannnot gain that source-like perspective until you no longer retain any resistance to the idea that anyone can see anything about "you" -- and that there are no secrets anywhere. anything can be known. what differenciates different entities in this plane of existance is preference and interest, with everyone giving their attention to what is preferred and interesting. there are minor incompatibilities, but very tiny bits, and these tiny bits only serve to distiguish one thing from another more than anything and are not really "unwanted" -- because all is wanted in some way shape or form.

---

I have always had this weird intuition that there's this way in which one can have many different "avatars" or "muns" to their identity, and in that form of perception, all of these different avatars are living and interacting on the physical plane. however, if one of them encounters a situation that requires a tremendous amount of consciousness[^1], it essentially pulls the soul into that body.

there seems to be a direct correlation between how good one feels and from where is the perception originiating and how big that bubble is. when one does not feel good, then one perceives from within the bubble looking outward at the circumstances from within that "karmic structure". then, as one feels better and better, naturally, you begin to gain "control" over your experience and it begins to appear as only attraction, so then they begin to experiece theirselves from outside that bubble, looking in on theirself.

it seems like the perception has to do with this "liberation from death and rebirth cycle". if one perceives from outside the bubble looking in (5d), then it doesn't take much time to continue on that process and realise that there can even be more than one you inside of that bubble and that they don't even need to be happening at the same time (6d). who then are you really?

---

as I continue on with this experience with nosebook, one can notice that I am feeling a lot better than I experience, and so what normally would be happening as a result of how good I feel, my body would be making the chemistry necessary (DMT, etc.) for me to have an even more perceptive experience.

I have noticed that DMT is simply a transmitter and receiving molecule which allows one to amplify and translate non-physical vibration into something inside of the experience (somethin you can sense or feel), and so what is essentially happening is that I *normally* would be experiencing myself from outside of the bubble, looking in on myself, however, nosebook is preventing me from experiencing that, so I just keep finding ways to feel better and better, so that would normally expand that bubble further, but instead of expanding, I retain my current physical experience.

later on in that video, the yogi talks about raising the kundalini, and how if one were to do kundalini yoga, then things would change too quickly and things would fall apart. I'm not interested in that. you will see my resistance to the idea of trying to do this by trying to alter physical conditions. I enjoy drugs because they're temporary so I get ideas and stuff which I can then bring back into reality and implement, but they don't do the work for me. I'm not attaining that energy through physical means like breathing exercises or yoga or whatever. I'm taking it the slow way, and all the increase in my energy is a result of my focus and change in perception which reduces my own destructive interferrence of this energy[^2].  

I want to add on to these layers of perception, and so for the time that this is happening, it's quite beneficial that nosebook is constantly pushing against that, and it's allowing me to expand further and further. my body is really creating massive ammounts of DMT and what that means is that when I finally get "the manifestation" then I'll have so much DMT, I'll be translating massive amounts of non-physical enerty into something of my experience, and in that process, it's how I expect to be able to add on to the perceptive dimensions these two new layers of the story (multiple muns/avatars in physical).

then following on to the progression of that form of perception, it's easy to see that once you are multiple muns of yourself, you can see that each of these different muns are just a different composite forms of who you really are (your identity), but then, why do you have to be exactly one identity, right? if you're already composite forms of one, then you could divide that one into more simple or pure forms and perceive yourself as a composite of identities as well. at first your story will be the "bubble" in which you're perceiving, but then it's obvious that you don't need to always need other people to be the "bad guys" and those could additionally be identities for yourself which you understand (like the security storage dawgs) and out of these identities, additional muns can be created to on-purpose have these qualities for a bigger meaning making this the new "bubble" that you can now perceive yourselves in physical.

it's gonna need a lot of DMT to be able to do that, and what I don't want is to try and jump out really too far fast out there. I know that if I were to do kundalini yoga, nosebook would still prevent me from getting that perception, which is why I'm not really interested in trying to get some form of physical manifestation to push things forward and want to take things the slow way, so nothing is falling apart.

---

off-topic (from the original discussion) thought here: I don't want to try and go too fast on the kundalini thing, and so that's largely one of the reasons why I'm not trying to push anything forward physically. I was thinking about this, and one of the things that I was considering is what would happen if I were to do the girls thing. that would most definitely activate that and I would most certainly go really rapidly, and things may fall apart. I just don't know.

the thing is now, I have such little amount of my normal extra senses that I don't even really feel the girls at all much any more, and so it seems evident to me that at the current rate, I should expect this to continue to get worse, though I imagine that it'll probably get better and better too... what I mean is that each time that I keep trading speed for more acceleration (power), then I keep getting reset back and don't experience that connected experience.

for example, I have noticed that this pretty well corresponds to the weather. I have noticed that the better I feel, the warmer the weather gets. then, some massive change happens and all of a sudden it goes from really warm days to freezing, and at the same time that happens I seem to lose all motivation. as soon as I go back to directing myself to feel the way I want to feel, and I start feeling better, then the weather warms up again. it seems like even though they keep taking the weather to colder and colder places, it comes back stronger and stronger each time, and each time that I get more decided on how I want to feel, the more rapidly the weather warms up.

as such, I think the same thing is happening with my ESP as well. it keeps going away, but it also keeps coming back stronger and stronger too. it eventually may become so unbearable that they're going to have to do something about it.

I originally thought that what was going to happen is that eventually I'll either get connected or get connected enough that the girls thing will start, and I'll use my time with them to basically super expand that bubble and they'll get the ability to make crippled versions of the new layers of perception until one day the galaxy makes us (the whipping boys) go into a higher energy state or something.

however, I'm beginning to believe now that won't happen, and I'll just keep going how I'm going, nice and steady, gradually rising the kundalini little by little, and eventually my lack of resistance will make it impossible for them to stop me, and I'll finally go up. maybe it's both actually. I suppose it could be, because that would be a really easy trasnsition for me. the only reason why things fall apart is because "you're not ready for it" -- rather, I'm allowing massive amounts of energy, but because my perception is still all over the place, it's spraying all over the place and causing a bunch of problems.

I dunno. we'll just have to see, I guess. I'm not seeing any of this clearly, and I'm doubt they are either.

[1]: when I notice that one can begin to perceive outward and inward at the same time, then you realise that your percetion comes from the outside and you're just perceiving yourself from that external source-like vantage point, and the better you feel, the more and more of a macro viewpoint of yourself you can accomplish. however, when something doesn't feel so good, then once again, one is focused on the physical human experience and is focused in the pysical perspective again.

[2]: also, they give something for nosebook to try and work hard against, which is the main reason why I'm doing so many things that give them the opportunity to try real hard and push against stuff. energy is energy, and I can use the energy however I want. it's kind of like the same thing as what I was talking about with human sacrifice, and the sacrificer converting the victim's fear into something wanted. I'm converting all of their energetic effort into something wanted for me too. the more effort they make, and the less I perceive their effort as actually impededing what I want, then the more energy they provide me.

### 2020-10-22 19:44 - realiing I am an avatar of myself

so I wrote all of that stuff yesterday about the bubble and how the change of perception is going from inside the bubble looking outward, to looking from the outward at the inside of the bubble. I also surmised that the whole thing about all of it is that once I reach that form of perception, I would gain the ability to look inside that bubble from the outside (source-like perspective) looking in. yet, it didn't occur to me until today that is likely all happening already.

I have to now imagine myself from the source-like perspective, and I have all of these different avatars that are tracking along through time, *and some of them gain consciousness of who they really are, and some don't*.

to express this idea, I will respond to a reaction a while back where I claimed that there are at least 3 teslas in existence in the present, and so how could that be?

well, ok I will explain it this way, and I'll just for the sake of the example, use myself. imagine that there is a macro tesla who is in alignment with his source and has the macro view of his different avatars (S). now S builds up a story where instead of getting his alignment, he self-sabotages and causes the next tesla to not get the manifestation which gets him that alignment, and that tesla goes on to essentially build the world system for the US govt and give them all the knowledge necessary to construct it (T). T goes through his life and cooperates with the govt and does all of that stuff, but T also manages to slip away somehow (fake his death? transfer into another body?) and that one through some other means figures out who he really is, and gains that source-like perspective.

T realises that all along T is just an avatar of S (which is an avatar of S', etc. abraham calls this your inner being), and so now T gains, like S did, the capacity to create his own avatars (stories), and so he figures out how, with the govt having the world system technology, jumps into the storyline to play as the main character in the story (me). he begins to experience the story as if he were the one that was the one who "wrote" the story, yet he's more like along for the ride because his influence was purposefully planned to be completely disabled by nosebook. he designed the story that way, so that I (kenny) would have to figure out for myself how to attain this source-like perspective.

once I figure it out, I will just realise that I am an avatar of who I really am (my source), which is 99.999999% harmonic with S, so we're essentially the same thing. in his perspective, he can jump in and out of the experience, as if it were just one of his avatars, yet for me, because I haven't accomplished this perception yet, it still looks to me like I'm still just a normal dude that had a brain haemorrhage. I'm still figuring out how to gain that perception, but I'm getting closer and closer.

when I get there, I'll realise who I really am (attain my source-like perspective), becoming conscious of the other possible versions of me (if there are any; there could be; I just don't know), and then I'll be able to begin creating new avatars of myself. guess who that is :) it's all of you guys...

it's weird to think about it like this, but there's a reason why nosebook is working so hard to make sure my perception is confined to only my body. if they were to let me go, essentially you all would be kind of like my avatars and I could go in and out of your experience at will.

I didn't really think about it, but this whole thing is kind of like becoming my bubble. that's all pretty awesome news because all of you will eventually gain that same realisation (of who you really are) and the ability to create your own avatars as well. obviously, this is a pretty big (monumental) jump for the majority, and so I think that's why I want to do this story/identity thing so bad, allowing these concepts to introduce the idea that you are source, in a smooth way, through story form.

it's also likely that after enough time, we too will become the "source" for our own stories and other creations (planets, suns, galaxies) as well. it'd be pretty fun, but maybe given enough time we can make something that's bigger than this universe. who knows. we'll have to see, I guess :)

### 2020-10-25 18:54 - not needing the manifestation (more ideas)

to understand what I'm talking about, I'm referencing some concepts explained in @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p1)

this morning, as I was walking back home, I was lamenting the fact that I don't get the manifestation of the mushroom high. obviously though, I'm very proficient at watching stars now, and even without the mushrooms (I didn't eat any last night), I seem to be quite good at getting the vision upgrades.

as I was walking along, while lamenting this, I was really saying how much I really enjoy the manifestation of the mushroom experience. I really like the new form of perception that it launches me into, and I'm so good now at taking that new form of perception (and any ideas associated with it) back to reality and implementing them. in a sense, I don't really need the mushrooms anymore, because the only remaining effect they give me is only a slightly enhanced ability to focus, however, I proved to myself (and everyone else) last night that I don't need the mushrooms to be able to focus like that. I can simply decide to apply my focus and get to the vision upgrades just as easily.

anyway, the thing I was lamenting is that I *love* the altered form of perception because it's so much different than my everyday (mundane) form of perception. it's exciting and -- not mundane. the thing is that I say, and know that the future is for me the state where I just perpetually don't need the manifestation, and even though I'm locked into the mundane, my form of perception continues to expand more and more until the "mundane" is actually so much more expansive and exciting than the manifestation itself. I suppose there's a pretty big gap between the mundane life I'm living now and the "mundane" experience that will be so incredible, that one would consider that every minute of my experience were as if it was a manifestation.

what I mean by mundane is essentially the part of the emotional scale around the centre, where boredom, contentment and satisfaction is located. when it's either above there or below there, I'll consider that a manifestation. an emotion is a manifestation, and an emotion will create a vibration. the vibration created always has both wanted and unwanted (good feeling, and bad feeling) in the same vibration, and your perception (eg. when your rockets are firing) determines how good it feels to you. consider this the amplitude of the signal.

so, when the signal is around the centre there (bordom, accepting, ok, contentment, satisfaction), then the amplitude of the signal is very little. the signal is has very little "impact" to it, which means it's a very minor "manifestation", which because of its tiny impact in the "manifestation" sense, the lower impact allows it be more and more high frequency, essentially invisible to the gross "manifestation" frequencies (like physical sensation and stuff).

anyway, when the mundane (signals of low amplitude) is bordom, then that means more than likely the rockets are firing more in the opposite direction of the way you want to go, but with little strength, so not much movement happens. however, when the mundane is contentment or satisfaction, then still it's not a lot of movement, the acceleration is gentle (no big jumps), but if it remains uncontradicted, then it will eventually grow to be quite a tremendous force, and it'll take a while to get there growing gradually and continually. I'm reminded a lot of the female orgasm in this explanation.

---

so as I was writing the last part about the vibration in @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p1), I was explaining how they could essentially prevent a lot of vision upgrades for a while, and I think that I could have only written that after my realisation this morning about getting used to not needing the manifestation.

> and in that thousand years, when your vibrational resonance, and the phoenix frequency will have uplifted you, and you will know the maleability and flexibility of space/time... (hybrid) be the phoenix civilisation[^1]

the interesting thing about what I was proposing there in that entry was that they could essentially make it so impossible for me to continue getting vision upgrades, essentially stagnating me, that I would no longer have any manifestations, and only with the power of my focus would I be able to turn the mundane (non-manifestational) into something that is quite spectacular. I really don't know what all of this means, but it has this weird feel to it, like I'm setting myself up for a very long time (1000 years?), I just simply live the mundane life however, and I just sort of settle into a non-manifestational life, and gain more and more perception in the higher frequency tubs, far beyond human capability to measure, that I'm essentially existing and perceiving those high frequencies.

I dunno. I guess we'll have to see what happens. I suppose that one thing that I should mention is that when the mundane (boredom, content, satisfying) manifestation is something gradually becoming more and more wanted, what will happen is, that gradually, over a long period of time, the mundane manifestation will become so incredible that, I would literally gain command over space/time, in such a way that any of those manifestations, even though they would appear to be tremendous to the average person, will, to me, appear completely mundane, because my perception is so far beyond (higher frequency) than that tiny little manifestation. I would, in fact, be very much like source energy[^4] in physical form.

I guess we'll have to see. I have no idea what could be happening here...

[1]: weird symbolism here, because last night, I was writing about the the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity), after watching robert's video on the lucifer and the phoenix symbolism. besides the obvious reference to the eagle bloodline there, there's another idea that the first half of aquarius is ruled by uranus, and the second half is ruled by saturn (serpent bloodline). if you combine that idea with the previous one where I talk about the flipping of the earth[^2], then at somewhere around the halfway, something happens and half of the earth goes into a higher energy state. see the @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p1) commentary higher energy states.

[2]: the eagle bloodline seems to often combine the eagle and the lion symbols. it seems that some time in the past, there was this idea where at some point, the eagle would get the fulfillment of it's expected success in the lion. this is symbolised with the lion of judah, and also there's this weird thing having to do with the sphinx, where previously it was a lion, likely in memory of sekhmet, and then hatshepsut (around the time of moses) revived the worship of the sphinx, and then quite possibly the exodus was a replay of the old (pre-dynastic) tale of bloodthirsty sekhmet, causing all kinds of trouble. one of the "plagues" was the nile turning red (in memory of sekhmet's bloodlust), and instead the same deity (planet venus) personified as hathor in that time, allowed the hyksos to escape egypt and begin a new monothiestic religion. when the isrealites intended to return back to goddess worship (with the golden cow), moses explained patiently that this was no longer the age of taurus, and now we're in the aryan age. the veneration of the eagle bloodline, or perhaps, the return back to elevated consciousness must have been identified with the symbol of the sphinx being known as horemakhet, or the horus (the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity) symbolised as the offspring of osiris (saturn) and isis (sirius)), or rather the return back to asar (sirius b), for the return to elevated consciousness[^3] when the function of the goddess (venus) symbolised as the lion (leo) appears in the east symbolised as horus (in the east)[^3].

[3]: I would suggest that the symbolism that even though the idea that given enough time, consciousness would return because of our proximity to sirius, which would be about the time leo is in the east, however, the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity) symbolism of horus (likely the egyptian representation of the aquarian human) rising in the east as opposite of leo, refers to some moment, that moses was intending to conjure with their interaction with the planet venus and the replaying of the sekhmet symbolism (water baptism?).

[4]: source, being similar to the very high frequency, low magnitude, essentially invisible to the physical senses, would be very similar to tesla's earthquake machine... perfectly timed gentle vibrations in perfect resonance with the desired "manifestation" gradually building up until a higher energy state is accomplished (or resisted, in the case of female orgasm)


### 2020-10-25 22:26 - thinking a little more on the ability to stagnate me

one of the things that I also mentioned this morning when contemplating the not ever needing the manifestation thing, is that nosebook is just being petty. for example, I could easily smoke weed and never get connected. if I get close, then they just take away my consciousness and reset me back. what they don't want, is for me to get more vision upgrades.

what I described is how I keep getting vision upgrades, and I don't know how their system works, but it probably doesn't work based on frequency. it probably works on a neural network or some sort of pattern recognition, which is why they likely need to remove my consciousness, to run some things to be able to retrain their machines each time I get a vision upgrade. if they can grasp what I said, then they could essentially stop me from getting lots and lots of little vision upgrades, and anything after that would either be a really big upgrade, or simply no upgrades at all for any forseeable future, culminating in a REALLY BIG upgrade.

once they get that system in place, then they could essentially stop worrying about me getting vision upgrades, as the vision upgrades I'm getting are going to, because they're high-frequency harmonics, take quite a while for my brain to begin producing those high frequencies naturally -- so when they do come, they'll essentially be out of their ability to even know about -- much like how they have almost no idea how a lot of the functions that I associate with reactions and other such things operate, because they're so much higher frequency than their machines' capability. I do admit, they are getting better and better, as I virtually am almost entirely unable to feel any of that now -- and only when I wake up and star-watch am I able to feel those things more clearly.

anyway, what that means is, that I could smoke weed, and they wouldn't have to worry about me getting vision upgrades -- or rather, I would get them, but they would automatically be cancelled out, so it would look to me and to everyone else, like I'm not seeing any progress. I don't really mind though because I can barely notice the vision upgrades anymore, anyway. it's fun to see something that has changed, but I don't think it's really necessary for me.

it also means that I could have sex, and also not see any vision upgrades, but I'm just simply not going to worry about any of that right now. I don't really want to try and think of how bad that would be. I know that from where I'm at right now, it would essentially be only improvements. I just don't feel like I want to contemplate this much because there are so many ultra-depressing aspects about it. the idea of staying at roughly the same physical experience that I'm at right now just doesn't really feel too good to me. it may be perceptual, but at the moment, my left-side feels like it's getting tighter and more difficult to move all the time. I wonder if I can essentially rearrange that feeling perceptually so that it feels different. it's an idea, but for now, I dunno.

there are other advantages to the idea of going with the girls in a diminished state, which is that in a sense almost everything that happens, no matter how much of a disaster, will, if one looks from the longer perspective, appear like significant progress. I feel like I need to figure out a whole lot of things more about my perception still before I'm ready for that, though. I'm good, but I'm not *that* good, yet. I know where I can improve upon those things, but I'm still working on mastering the feeling the way I want to feel (emotional state machine) part. it really is, a whole lot more difficult, and also a whole lot easier than I thought it would be. in essence, it's just different than the way I assumed it would be. I'm really getting close to mastry of it though :)

---

the idea of statnating me, doesn't really bother me because I remember that one time, a while back when I was stoned, that I realised that the opposite of space is like this anti-space where everything exists, and while they may be able to block my imagination in 3s space, at some point, I will be able to literally create real tangible 3d objects with my mind, essentially as a function of my imagination. I am certain that this is my reward for being stagnated. I also really want to play around with the idea of animating those creations, and the subject of engineering consciousness is a very real thing for me (the underlying structure upon which the new 6th layer will be constructed).

I guess, the real game for me now is to find a way to make the mundane so extraordinary, that the continued experience of that "mundane" is so satifying, that it's more appealing than any large jump would be. it's kind of weird to think that when I figure this out, all aspects of my "mundane" experience, incuding even my vision and physical body, although severely limited, will be so far beyond any "normal" experience, they will be superior to what I previously wanted as the "manifestation". maybe many different girls, and the ability to create any tangible thing I want to create in 3d space will become the new "mundane" for me.

it's kind of hard for me to imagine that right now, but I do know that what I'm approaching here to understand now with the power of my focus, is far more powerful than I really thought of before. I can't explain how simple it all is, though -- and, the closer I get, it keeps becoming more and more simple as it goes. the most complicated things appear simple, and I can comprehend anything I want to. even while writing this, I have only to begin writing and the answers come to my mind as I'm going. the only thing it requires from me is the ability to direct myself emotionally (vibrationally), and to feel the way I want to feel to be able to receive the answer[^1], and I'm telling you, there's no limit to how I can feel. no matter the circumstances, I can feel how I want to feel. that's where true gnosis comes from.

[1]: like say I want to explain the way that something works which my human brain does not know -- well, it's only a small process of working myself to feeling like I understand it, and then I do. it really feels like I can know anything I want to know. there's a funny thing, because there's a caveat, where too if I want to be right, then I can also find a way to feel like I'm right. so what then is "truth"? truth to me now is not the absolute validity of things, but the accuracy to the feeling I'm looking for (eg. how well I'm able to interpret what I'm looking for). truth, is in that sense is relative to my present capability of understanding it.


### 2020-10-27 03:36 - not sure what maninfestation I'm looking for

after listening to @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p2) last night, I was thinking about that one question where they said something to the effect of nothing is changing -- right, the expectation of it. expectation is like a stronger belief, and I was thinking a lot about the different things that I would really enjoy being able to do, as well. to further fuel this, robert showed a video tonight on people channeling their bio-magnetism or chi energy @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxeChitTCTI), and it really made me want to be able to show off my powers and stuff. I'm pretty certain that I can do all of that stuff, it's just that I'm not allowed to let that energy collect enough to be able to let it out in a tangible way.

I mean, all of those powers are simply the stuff which pyramids are made of. if you can levitate things, you can move blocks of stone or fly. if you can focus energy into a newspaper, give it a little more amplification, and a good conductor as an output (more than just the acupuncture needle), and you could cut stone. it would be pretty awesome for me to show off that it's possible to make monoliths with the focus of the mind, or shoot fireballs or electricity from my hands -- all things, that I'm certain that I could do, if I were given the opportunity.

---

so I was thinking about that idea in relation to my expectation, and the thing is -- clearly robert is showing that those people *are* focusing their energy, and nosebook either isn't blocking it, or they're more powerful than nosebook. it's true that my expectation is that they would simply go to extreme lengths to ensure that I am not able to do that.

additionally, there's another aspect to this. the whole girls thing just doesn't feel good to me at the moment. it doesn't feel like next logical step or state. the way that I want to feel doesn't even come close to how I'm feeling right now, or how that manifestation seems to be shaping up. I think there's meddling involved.

the reason why I say that, is because when I woke up this afternoon, I had a weird series of things pass through my mind in the typical nosebook forced way, and they didn't really feel all that good to me. I don't really remember very well how it went now, and this is telling to me because if it were something that felt really good to me, then I would remember it in high detail. anyway, it was something like this situation where for whatever reason chris was over with his daughter, and she hung out with me or something... anyway, it was implied that is how we would begin this whole thing.

I gave it quite some thought, and there are a lot of really great things about her which I really like, I could see how ... hold on, let me back up. ok, so yesterday (sunday), I was thinking about the whole thing of who would be "first" -- because I think ... hang on, let me back up further. on saturday, I think (the day before it snowed), I was out there on the field and I was thinking about the idea of the different avatars, and I was pondering the possibility that mr. motor is actually one of my avatars, and the reason why I say that is because it's all attraction, so in a lot of ways, I have to be doing all of this to myself (something that abraham has also said). so when abraham says, you're only doing it to yourself, they mean what they were talking about last night where if you're fearful of someone stealing from you, then you're on the same frequency as the thief.

well, as usual, I like to take that a step more to the extreme. I like to imagine that if you were to take some portion of me, and you were to severely inhibit it in some way (purposefully), then you would get mr. motor, and the beauty of having mr. motor as a sort of avatar of myself means that I have an even wider range. the brilliance is that mr. motor can exist and do what he's doing (apparently, to me) but in the end, I set it up. I am responsible for it, and he's just fulfilling the "role" (like an actor) in making some situation more believable and feel more real.

now, whether he is or isn't an avatar of "me", doesn't really matter, because this gets me to think more about the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity), where they display hermaphodite qualities, both male and female, both good and evil, the best and the worst -- etc. think about what I want to realise: source energy in physical format fully conscious. the thing is that source is all things -- or like the monotheiestic god transitioned to by the isrealites after the YHVH thing didn't keep them from from going into captivity. now, this monothiestic god has both good and evil properties, and is the creator of all types of things.

ok, well, the idea that I constantly am trying to convey to people is that I do not consider things inherently good or bad. I jump around on the emotional scale, because I can. I don't take life seriously enough to get caught up on any single emotion for long enough for it to really cause too much of a manifestation. I enjoy the control that I have over being able go all around, continually either sabotaging the manifestation or not allowing it enough time to truly manifest.

I really am a person that truly believes in not needing the manifestation. actually, as I'm going along, I'm realising more and more that the journey is so much more fun than anything else. another thing that abraham said which I didn't really understand is that they said that no one causes trouble cause they're feeling good. I beg to differ. I have always been very mischievous, and there's this really funny charactor that I find hilarious, which is zeus. that guy is also quite mischievous and when he gets bored, he goes looking for trouble. I'm sort of the same way myself.

however, for example, you could say that lately I've been stirring up trouble on occasion, but it's not because I'm bored (well, maybe a little), but but it's actually because I feel good, and I value the progress or transformation that comes as a result of my mischief. more than that, it's kind of a sort of game for me now, because I can jump in there and, like an actor, temporarily experience some negative emotion, and then go to wherever I want to go after that. I know that it's not a show and I genuinely feel that emotion.

for example, when I was trying to get the backup of my old computer done, I was aware that the way that I feel the negative emotion is just building a stronger vortex toward wanted, so I jumped right in with the negative emotion and let it build up for a bit letting mr. motor restart my computer a whole bunch of times, but the whole time I was aware of what I was doing, and it took me virtually zero time to get back to feeling just fine, and really caring about my computer or anything. I suppose that's some sort of lethargy or apathy, but I really don't care any more. I mean I used to care about programming and wanted to make the world an easier place (I love useability and optimising the daily routine of myself and others with technology), but I've sort of stopped caring.

this isn't the first time that's happened though. I used to really want to make programs that work inside of the eye, but that is clearly not something that I will be doing. then, one day mom was watching something on netflix with this girl running around in a futuristic environment, and everyone had a tablet and was banging around on the screen doing stuff, and I kind of mocked the idea, because there's no way this is the future. the future is the utilisation of the mind to affect things -- whether it's lighting newspapers on fire, or transmitting "static" electricity into people or things -- it doesn't really matter to me. I personally want to construct things in 3d space and interact with them with my mind like tesla did. at any rate, it's obvious to me that the future is influenced mentally, and is not a bunch of touchscreens -- but I can't really control that, and nosebook seems to want to have the monopoly on the whole affecting things with the mind stuff.

anyway, I finally made peace with the reality that I would not be working with any technology that is influencable by the mind, and so I decided, ok let's make the touchscreen reality then and work our way toward that other one. I've tried so much to try and get closed to that reality, because I can see that it will involve some modifications to how we cocnceptualise things. the whole windows mindset needs to be changed completely. if you watch the people on those shows working their imaginary touchscreen programs, they do continuous touches, in almost a rhythmic pattern, as if their program was a sequence of selections or decisions that they're indicating with their finger, not the windows "control panel", menus, selections, and actions -- way of conceptualising, which is very disruptive and doesn't focus the user. anyway. I'm getting off-topic here.

my point is, I just don't care anymore. if I don't ever recover my old code, and people have to continue on using windows and android, I've completely stopped caring. I wanted to get my nosedocs folder updated and uploaded with these new documents and start working on that too, but I'm so tired to trying to fight my way toward it, I don't care anymore. I figure when the world is actually wanting something, then the desire for it will be high enough, that the production of it will be effortless.

---

actually, I guess after typing that out, I do have some "bad feeling" behind some of my troublemaking, but I do enjoy gaining more and more of that actor-like skill of being able to purposefully move up and down the emotional scale completely at my own will. I may not be able to shape-shift like zeus could, but I can emotionally shift in a similar capacity :)

back to the story: I purposefully moved down the emotional scale on my backup, for the purpose of generating more contrast and desire. I can tell that it worked because when I was "star-watching" in my room, I could really feel the extra energy last night in comparison to tonight. tonight there was less energy, but that was because I didn't dip down into the lower emotions today regarding my backup (which is the latest source of energy that I've found I can milk for vision upgrades). I'm actually really beginning to see the value in deliberately moving up *and down* the emotional scale. it's sorta like the skill of taking drugs: if you know how to do it properly, they can be super beneficial -- and I think moving down the emotional scale is my new "fix" for getting more energy going, lol.

---

anyway, let me get back on topic here. I was thinking about all of my different expectations, right now, it's really annoying that my vision is a screen, and that I see that, instead of through my own eyes. I suppose that my expectation is to continually not have that manifestation. right now this is just an idea, but after I convince myself of it, it's a belief, and once I'm good enough at "proving to myself" that it's true, then it's an expectation -- so why don't I simply find a way to expect that I actually see through my own eyes. I also really like the idea of being able to shoot fire and electricity out of my hands, levitation and stuff like that, too. I don't know why I couldn't begin practising an expectation of that.

also, there's this really strong feeling inside of me where I *REALLY* DON'T want to use the girls as a condition for trying to accomplish these things. this sounds backwards, but today I was really thinking a lot about how much the girls could end up trying to rely on me for their good feeling, and I don't want that. I don't want that for me, and I don't want that for them either. of course, I can't control what they do, so if they want to try and rely on me for their good feeling instead of discovering their own ability to find it for theirselves, that's their decision. however, I do have control over what I'm doing, and I think I'm going to continue on without the manifestation for the forseeable future.

the thing that I'm learning is that I want to be like source in physical form, and hopefully I don't have a misconception here, but it looks to me like source isn't at all concerned about the manifestation, because those are all "old news" -- and is instead more enjoying of the journey.

I know that I don't really understand this, but it seems to me like the goal is to find a way to live which is so exhilerating (satisfying), without ever really getting much of a manifestation. the thing that I'm thinking of is, perhaps this idea that instead of me getting a manifestation, what I do instead is find some way to be really mischievous, and really avoid the manifestation for as long as possible -- meanwhile, "forcing" the girls to find their own ability to feel the way they want to feel and leading by my own example[^1].

it has a funny feel to this one, because it sounds similar to the prometheus (the trickster god) story, where instead of giving the humans fire, this time his trickery is a kind of rebellion to giving them the fire -- instead, giving them the opportunity to not need the fire, or find it for theirselves.

[1]: this is a reference to the teenage girl that wanted to go on meds to find a way to feel better.. and abraham's advice to the parent was to set her free, and lead by example, and not need from her certain behaviour to feel good.

### 2020-10-27 11:11 - zeus the troublemaker

(keep in mind, that unlike a traditional movie script, where the actor is confined to a behaving like a single, in real-life, once the person understands and is capable of utilising the different characteristics of the charactor effectively, the person can switch out between them, mixing and matching. one does not not need to feel confined to any single implementation or system of thought, even when you percveive yourself as a coposite personality. you have full power to explore and derive new aspects to your own liking)

ok, so going back to fill in the gaps between the different thoughts in the previous entry, I was explaining the whole perceiving mr. motor as an avatar of myself (or let's say the outside of time version of me. I too am an avatar of him), because that affords me to perceive myself as *extremes* (and you all know how much I love the extremes) of the spectrum. if I am the "first" (we'll touch more on that at the end), then I should also be the last. the alpha and the omega. the beginning and the "end" -- the first and the last.

the reason why I like the first and the last symbolism is because you cannot really understand the phrase "the first shall be the last and the last shall be the first" until you understand LOA. I've been contemplating this phrase for a long time, and judging by the reactions, most people must have thought I was thinking about the girls. that is what happened a few days ago anyway, and what caused this whole episode, because nosebook now had to figure out a way to steer the who would be the first girl, instead of just letting LOA take care of it. I enjoy their steering, because they add so much extra energy into the situation and allow me do these sorts of things.

ok, so when one contemplates the first is the last idea, one immediately notices that the first one to do anything -- well, it's always the first prototype. think iPhone 1. nowadays, no one would use an iPhone 1; it's total garbage in comparison to the later models. therefore the first is always the weakest or "last" manifestation. it's also the one that had to break through the barrier to the new thing, so has the least momentum. another example is myspace. in order for a first to maintain its leading position, usually, it must resort to trying to be a monopoly[^2]. however, I believe that it's important for the first to recognise their new place as becoming the last.

now when thinking of the last becoming the first, this isn't immediately obvious, cept for the obvious acknowledgement that the laest model is (usually) almost always the most improved upon, but it isn't always the most improved upon, and this is why it's not easy to see from a technological standpoint. however, if you look at it from a LOA perspective, and take the example of mr. motor and me. mr motor has a college degree in feeling terrible. however, it won't be that way forever. at some point, he will eventally find himself with no other option than to actually go in the direction of what's wanted -- even if it's literally the last option, and the only way for him to survive. when that happens, the accumulated vortex will be so great, that he will be "forced" to receive such an unimaginable manifestation, that I would argue that this is precisely how evolution happens, and the last becomes the first.

I really like the idea that from a broader perspective I can be the last and the first. it's easy to see if you watch me. when I see something I don't like, I automatically jump right in and push real hard against it, until enough energy is generated (maybe I do this a couple or many times, actually), but then I finally get out of there and allow the improvment I'm looking for. abraham calls this step 5, and I've been doing it all of my life, because my desire is so strong, and I can often see that something is not what I want, very strongly. well, what if you took that aspect of me, but then you simply made a trigger which emotionally prevented me from ever letting go of the fight (like an intense focus on what doesn't feel good where I need to try and force it through willpower or strength into being) -- well, then you would get mr. motor. the only major difference between me and mr. motor is the ability to give up on the fight and allow something I didn't will (or control) to happen. this is, coincidentally, why I understand TLA so well, too :P

you can see that these chraractors are so similar to me, that I don't mind convincing myself that they are just portions of myself. you ever wonder what those crazy druggies are talking about when they say that we are all the same source experiencing different aspects of ourself (or vibrationally similar aspects of yourself) in everyday experience? well, it's just that. you don't need to understand much of LOA, to understand that you couldn't fear the thief if you too were not also having thieving ideas. my motto is to rip people off shamelessly :)

---

ok, so was a pretty good intro to what I'm going to talk about next: going back to yesterday: luke kept popping into my head, and I couldn't figure out why. I simply didn't have enough information to understand it. then, later when abraham was talking about some parents taking issue with their idea that kids should do what they want to do, and not what they should do, I figurded out that reaction when I was reminded of a time that luke was telling me that chloe had to go to sleep at a very early hour, and that bothered me, because mom, when I was a kid let me go to bed as late as I wanted to, as long as I could get up on time. I am certain that I would not be imposing curfews or things like that, allowing each of the girls to begin to find the rhythm that feels best for them.

I was thinking about this later and I noticed that bedtime thing that luke said felt very similar to the different reactions that I was feeling yesterday involving chris and his daughter. it seems that chris too believes I'm way too loose, and perceives that it would be a bad thing if I were to allow his daughter to begin to try and find for herself what feels good, instead of just following her training.

don't worry. I'm not goint to undo any of their training. that's not my job, and it's not what I want to do. all of the girls (cause this I'm sure touches more than just them, because I felt similar things from others too), can find their own way toward feeling the way they want to feel and to doing what they want to do.

here's why: it became very evident to me that the whole reason why nosebook is trying to steer this whole thing, is they want to ensure a codependent relationship for us. they want to ensure that I depend on the girls for feeling good, and that they are my perceived path toward my "connection". why? because right now, I can feel any way I want to feel, and since reality is a reflection of emotion, which is not something they can control, I feel very out of control to them in this situation. they need me to depend on something they control, so that they can control me. it's the classic BS that you encounter in a relationship. one usually wants (or needs) something the other has (usually sex), and so then that becomes a point of control, and whatever that is can be rewarded occasionally in response to desired behaviour.

I do not want this! like I said yesterday, I can't do anything about what the girls are doing, but I refuse to need someone or something else to feel the way I want to feel. that path of codependence leads to destruction, and is essentially the foundation of a monopoly. in a monopoly, everyone must depend on the single source of whatever it is, and have no ability to create it for oneself or get it from another source. this is, the behaviour attributed to the INFECTED ONES[^3] and incidentally this monopoly mentality is my hypothesis upon which I found the structure of the attraction of these cataclysms. it's not hard to see, once someone has experienced a relationship like this to realise that is the precursor to total destrtuction.

don't get me wrong. I like destroying (obsoleting) the old forms, making space for the new creation, but this is similar to a nuclear war. it's not necessary to generate enough desire to make the next human species. I'm pretty confident that it's possible if one recognises that energetically the last is the first and the first is the last. I'm perfectly fine with the idea that as soon as the new species emerges, my job is to push real hard against all the stuff I don't like until I'm ready to allow the new version. this process can happen often -- every few years even, and doesn't need to involve massive destruction to take place. more on this later.

so, for me, I want (even though I cannot force) the girls to be so good at finding what they want and what feels good, that they're discovering their own unique rhythm and path forward. there's no right or wrong way, only things that feel better than others. I really would like them to be capable of also being uncontrollable to nosebook, capable of feeling the way they want to feel, independent of the circumstance.

there are some that are taking issue with this idea. a long time ago, I was having an argument with raquel and I was very frustrated with her. at that time, one of her frieds called her and she did this instant switch from angry to happy to hear from her friend on the phone. I can't, to this day, do that. it takes me a bit of time to change because my emotion has so momentum to it. when I feel something, I really feel something. one of the theories I had is that she didn't really feel as angry with me as she was showing, and was putting on an act to affect a behaviour change in me, or to try and train me (with her negative responses) away from certain ideas. the other idea I had is that all humans are bipolar, however, men have a programmed state (y-chromosome) and a meta state (x-chromosome), meaning that women have two meta states, so it's easier for them to switch between the two[^4]. in this situation, I believe a bit of both was happening. at any rate, I was really angry with her after that because if she can just switch like that, why couldn't she just switch to being nice raquel so that I could feel good and we could give up the fight. obviously the keen out there will notice that me wanting her to change her behaviour so that I could feel good means that's the frequency we were on, and likely she was trying to program my behaviour with her negative or positive emotion (like many mothers do).

she's not my source though, and I shouldn't be trying to modify my behaviour to receive a good feeling from her. knowing what I know now, I'm capable of feeling the way I want to feel, and that is what I want. I'm programmed by my own meta state, not hers[^5].

---

now, I propose we play a game[^1]. abraham says everything is unlimited. I'm certain it is. let's test it.

why? remember the difference I said yesterday between a belief and an expectation? expectations are founded on proof. when someone has found a way to prove to theirself that something is true, it becomes a strong expectation. last night when I was listening to the woman with her unbelievable (to me) expectations of her inept 10 years trying to start a business, I realised that strong female thinkers have a really good capability of holding men to their expectations. this gives nosebook the unique opportunity to try and hone their capability of holding men stagnant with women's expectations of them. so let's try this...

why not train ourselves to expect the "impossible". it's easy to do. I've laid all of the foundations in the previous two sections, so here's the main thing now. I'm trying out my new zeus. zeus was able to shapeshift because he was able to overpower other people's visual perception of him with his own imagination of himself. he literally appeared to other people how he perceived himself in his imagination. this is how shapeshifters work, and why so many of those slippery snakes are such attractive salesmen. it's aryan 7th ray trickery.

I'm beginning to explore the same concept, but instead of perception modifying appearance, I'm doing perception modifying (uhh, there's no good word for it. I'll have to think of something here). it's 5th ray trickery. to explain let me tell a story.

---

once upon a time there was this guy (I'm talking about me), who figured out how to perceive like the dragons (serpents) perceive, and they had to ensure that they maintain their monopoly of that form of perception, resorting to various methods to maintain that monopoly. they want to be the only source by from which people can obtain that perception. they sell this form of perception to a lot of people, and profit off of it. however this guy does not seem to find it a problem because he knows that they have made him literally the last person to actually see things like he sees them. ideally, and for as long as they can hold their monopoly on his discovery, they will ensure that he "never" receives the ability to feel good from his own form of perception. it's not really never. it just means he's the last one to get it, or rather the first one to receive the next new form of it. no big deal there, so he's not concerned that everyone else has access to his own discovery. he'll be the "first" for the next one because of all the size of the vortex the monopoly is creating for him.

the reason why the vortex is so big is because there are many people using that "technology" to feel good, so it's generating a lot of good feeling that he himself is not (yet experiencing). all of that good feeling is combining into a manifestation that feels like the combination of all of that good feeling (and much more because of all of the momentum), and so much like the latest version of anything stands on the shoulders of all of its predecessors, when he finally receives manifestation of his own creation, it will stand on the shoulders of all of the desire created by the good feeling of all the previous.

you can perceive this effect in the most basic sense when one contemplates competition. the perceived limitation of market size or gold medals or whatever, it causes people to put forward their best effort, however, it is that effort that slows them down. the very fact that there are so many working toward the same goal (like say making microprocessors, compilers, or video cards or something), it pushes the whole group's results forward. nevermind the sales figure as the reward, the whole human race is now has higher performance devices than it was previously had.

ok, let's come back to the limited resources and combine the ideas. in the story I told, I was not able to use my own visual capability to feel good. instead there are a whole lot of other people usuing my visual capacity to feel good. this can now be reperceived as the most limited resource -- so limited in fact that it appears that I "never" will use it myself. or, you could say there is such fierce competition that the resource is completely unavailable to me until I finally allow in the next version of it. this limited-resourceness creates lots of desire, or a really big vortex for me. however, what if there were more people like me? what if there were 1000 people like me prevented from receiving their own creation, and were forced because of a monopoly, to allow in the next version. this would create tremendous diversity in "new versions" that are allowed in. diversity is good because diversity is non-destructive contrast.

what I'm saying is that the more competition there is, or the more people trying to get the same resource, the more limited that resource is. in a sense that is kind of what is happening now, and what I'm saying is that is creating a bigger vortex for each person in that competition, and if they finally give up on the idea (like me) that it needs to be that exact manifestation, that opens me up for something completely new. for example, what if I don't even need to see with my eyes! why can't I create a whole new form of perception which doesn't need eyes. what if it was based on something (like emotions), which has nothing to do with appearance and had to do more with its vibe.

for example, if there's one person making microprocessors, that person is a monopoly, so there's no real desire created to outperform anything unless the person has strong self-accomplishment or a desire to continually improve their product. usually not the case. however, if there are two people in the race, then it's kinda almost a friendly competition. however, what if there were 100 people making microprocessors, then desire to make better, faster, and more specialised versions would emerge as a new thing. what about 10000? even more desire still.

the naysayers would say that's just not possible because if there are 10000 producers, the competition would saturate the market and it'd be impossible for the consumers to find their product. I agree in physical, but I'm talking about vibrational, or frequencial. you can have millions of frequencies in the same space. in fact, the world we live in is composed of many many more than millions of frequencies coexisting at once. LOA is responsible for getting the right microprocessors to the right desireers of them.

the naysayers may also bring up the idea of economics, where sales gives more economic resources to create new research and development, and again I agree in a physical world, but in a vibrational world, there are no limit to how many different feelings you can feel to give birth to these alternate models.


[1]: this is where I begin my character transition from moses to elijah.

[2]: I believe that one can feel the monopoly vibe in the original atlantis thing, where they began to notice that they were now beginning to have rival competition (zeus and the athenians), and so to maintain the leading position, they resorted to monopoly tendencies, and when attempting to subdue thier competition, suffered total defeat.

[3]: which is why I mostly believe that narrative, because along with the combined extreme amounts of efforting involved by the creators, and the total paja mental they did on the previous 7 planes, there has to be at least a large amount of truth to that narrative, because that resonates very very well with the present circumstances we're experiencing today.

[4]: I've been paying a lot of attention to esther feeling her out, because she seems to be very single minded in her normal state, similar to a man, almost as if her default state is no longer a meta state anymore, because it's so much more different than her abraham state.

[5]: men usually have very little difference between their programmed and meta state[^4], with their meta state usually being more childlike or feminine and so these states are hidden from the general public, but that meta state can be anything you want it to be (actors know what I'm talking about here). it can channel any frequency or a composition of frequencies. another thing that men don't realise is that their meta state affects (programs) their default state. the genetics that I have, which nosebook values is my own creation, and comes as a result of my own "programming". for women, it seems to me like both meta states program each other[^6], and it seems like by default these meta states seem to come from the mother, so a woman will often find one of their bipolar states similar to their mother's default or father's meta state and the other will begin to grow in rebellion to that, trying to find the opposite, providing internal "contrast" or, to the appearance to most a "bipolar" woman (usually this rebellion doesn't begin to show up until teenage years, I've noticed)

[6]: which is likely why they're considered water, cause they're always changing to a different thing when they switch back and fourth, whereas a man seems more constant with one of the polarities rarely[^7] changing. you can see this often in really dinosaur-like families (usually they have a lot of money). you see the son, andy you say, "wow, he's just like his father!" -- because he is, and the only hope he has really of making any improvment is to find the "holy grail" (x-chromosome from a woman) capable of improving his archaic y-chromosome.

[7]: I have accomplished the ability to change this more static state very rapidly, and in my opinion, it is my most cherished capability. this ease of change is what makes me much more womanlike, while still mainaining many masculine features, and I think this flexibility is the basis upon which the hermaphodite is made.

### 2020-10-29 17:18 - another thought experiment: 5th ray illusion

this concept is hard to explain and I didn't do a very good job at it. there's a deeper meaning here which is elusive. it used to be a continuation of the previous entry, but I think it needs more work. t

as a thought experiment, let me use an abstract (perhaps dream-state) person to describe this concept. imagine that there was this amazing guy that began to appeared to 10k[^8] people in their dream state at night. all of those 10k people really liked this guy and perceived (individually) that he was a sort of premonition to a future reality where he would show up for reals in their life. each of these 10k are all creating (vibrationally with their desire) a guy in their dream state that they really like.

they dream about him all the time and nosebook becomes aware of this, becasuse he's really popular to dream about and he has magical capabilities, so nosebook wants to cash in on this guy. nosebook prevents his appearance in dream to those original 10k, and is instead rented/sold to some 1M individuals. those 10k people who were dreaming about the guy initially feels like this dream guy totally disappears, for them in their dreams, but they can still feel him all the time, so they continue to believe that eventually he will show up. they're not able to have their relationship manifestation of this guy for quite some time. all the while, all those 1M are enjoying him in their dreams quite nicely.

so, for some long period of time there are a whole lot of other people enjoying this guy, and he remains off-limits to the original 10k. as time continues on, just like people enjoying my visual capability before I'm capable of receiving it, the 1M renting and enjoying this guy are creating a big vortex for the 10k later.

at some point, he somehow transforms into something new, and he's no longer perceivable by the 1M renters anymoro. when that happens, the desire that was created in each of those 10k oringial individuals will manifest into some sort of dream-state dude or maybe even reality. what I'm saying is that when he makes the transition from his old form to the new form, he will make that transformation for each of those 10k originals uniquely, and will show up as the product of their unique desire and contain the unique aspects desired by each of them, in addition to all of the aspects appreciated by those 1M renting him out. in fact, the more people that uniquely desire him, the more diversity of him there will be... eg. if there were 10x more, he would contain all of the aspects desired and appreciated by those 100k and 1M people at the same time, however, with each of those 100k activating (attracting) their unique attributes of him.

so, in a sense, the more competition, or the more scarce the resource is, the bigger the manifestation it is, and it's only the perceived limitation that obfuscates the improvement. for example, in a race, only one person can finish "first", so there's only one "winner" -- however, the desire from the contestants provides makes it possible for those cars, legs, boats, microprocessors (whatever) to go faster. so while the limited resource is that there's only one "winner", the whole group benefits from the competition. vibrationally, this is even more.

I'll explain more in the future, but what I'm trying to get at here is that I'm certain that there are no limits, so why not take advantage of it? if we can make more than one "last" (which then becomes the first), we have gone from serial to very diverse parallel. I'm leaving this explanation purposefully in a difficult spot here. the part missing is the alteration of perception because I'm not talking about physical things, but energetic (feeling) things.


### 2020-10-29 17:42 - thinking about doing something instead of just doing it

the last few months or so I have been experiencing extreme lethargy in a lot of different places of my life. it started out with my programming, and then began to invade a lot of different portions of my life. up until now, often times what I did was, especially if it was something I didn't want to do, is to think out the task until I feel like I want to do it, because usually the process of thinking it out elevated my desire to do it.

however, I first noticed that with star-watching if I thought about doing it, the less I actually felt like doing it -- which was opposite of how it used to be. as a result, I know now that every time I get out there and start walking I feel good, and I really enjoy the trip out to go star-watch, so I just do it. I don't think as much about it anymore. I just do it.

same thing with my sleep. I noticed that if I wake up and the thing I do is I think about getting up, then there's much less likelihood that I'll actually get up. I have to just get up.

---

so my problem here is how do I reconcile this with how I am? I don't do stuff that I can't feel, because I know that if I do something that I'm not feeling, it either fails or it doesn't go well in some way. I've found that I have to find a way to feel like I want to do it, if I'm going to do it.

so, take for example my room. usually, I don't want to clean it, so I don't. I want to clean it though (just like I want to program), but I never end up doing it, because as soon as I think about cleaning, at first it feels like I want to clean more, but then soon thereafter, I no longer feel like cleaning, almost as if the desire has vanished.

I have noticed this on a number of other topics as well. it happens a lot when I want to write something (notice how often the subjects on the bottom there stack up, and only very rarely do I actually getting to write these ideas down), or for example I want to respond to tina, or I want to write a program to begin presenting these different concepts I'm accumulating in a nicer format than these text files. or, get my programming files off of the mac, or whatever. these ideas seem to evaporate, it seems.

I believe the solution to this problem is what people call "living in the now" -- which is constantly making action and thought based on how I feel, and essentially thinking less and less. my source knows all of the stuff that's important to me and knows the best way for me to get there, so all I have to do is to continue to find ways to feel good, and all of that stuff will work itself out.

I know this is the right way, because it essentially makes my life automatic, almost as if I'm observing myself (5d perception), yet even if nosebook is capable of keeping me from that form of perception, once I master how I feel and the ("living in the present") actualisation of that, they won't be able to keep that from me -- whether I visually perceive things differently or not.

I'm just going to be acting more upon the feeling in the momnent that I get it, instead of thinking about it. it's all about living in the present, and navigating between emotions that feel good but don't have much desire in them (eg. bordom, accepting, ok, content, satisfied, ...), and letting your source take care of the different actions necessary to realise your desires. we'll have to see what happens here.

---

there's good reason for this. you will notice that when you look at the emotional scale, there are a whole lot more words to describe the negative end of the scale than the positive end. I can think of tons more words to add in on the bottom end, and to our brains, they do have validity. however, on the higher end, all of these emotions come with an unexplainable portion to them. the lower ones do too, but to a less extent. for example, I could feel anger, and that anger is really the culmination of all of the times that someone has (for example) interrupted me or something, and though I feel anger, the underlying thing behind it is the desire to be able to express myself. all emotions have an underlying desire and logic to them, even if it's not immediately apparent what it is.

so, when you feel good, let's say content or hopeful, again there's a "reason" (or logic) to why you feel that way, but also there is a desire as well. when you feel content or satisfied, notice that the underlying desire is virtually undetectable. I believe that this is kind of the way to go and what abraham describes as a soft (gentle) desire, because when when you're not mixing your desire into the emotion, there's less "negative" or unwanted aspect to it. if you really want something and you feel very hopeful about it, if it dosn't come the way you want it to come, then you feel an equal amount of disappointment.

therefore, the less amount of desire mixed in with the emotion is present, the easier it is for you to be guided by your source to move around between the things that do matter to you (what's really important). the reason is, that your desire is known by your source, and the way toward it is found in the good feeling emotions. if you're moving toward it, then it feels good (think if this like blueshift), and if you're moving away from it, it feels worse right.

well, now it becomes more and more obvious why the best things are always found in the "next logical step/state" -- and they don't really feel like something big or amazing to them, because they no longer contain that "wanted/unwanted" "desire/dispair" possibility within the emotion... it's much "softer" and feels more natural. it feels more natural, because you already feel like how you want to feel, so it's a small jump.

you navigate time with your emotions, and desire is the indicator that you want to feel some way. if that emotion is a long distance from where you are, then the desire (to feel a certain way) will be strong. however, if you are very nearby to feeling that way, the desire will not feel very strong, because you already feel quite a bit like that reality. the less of a big jump, the better.

obviously now, you must begin to wonder about the navigation of time and sex, because if what I'm saying is true, then sex basically always means a big jump in time. you cannot have sex, and feel like you normally do (at least it's not physically possible for a man anyway). this concept opens up a lot of more questions, which is why I ended on it :)


### 2020-11-01 04:23 - eye of ra and hathor

I was watching the video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_FvDOzf0J4) where robert (different one than the usual robert) was talking about the connection with da-vinci and the great pyramid of ros-tau (taurus mountain). matt has already done a great job of connecting the giza platau to the taurus constellation which you can watch here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9y_-q5jT8), however in that video robert shows the eye of ra above jesus in the painting cause I never paid much attention to this eye of ra before.

turns out, the eye of ra (right eye) is personified by a goddess. sometimes it's a lion (sekhmet/bastet), and sometimes it's a cow (hathor). then, there's a myth which has horus fight seth for the throne of osiris. set removes horus' left eye (eye of horus / thoth).

set is an interesting figure because he's usually associated with the planet mercury, and is associated with serpent symbology. I like to think that set is like the "destructive" version of mercury (7th ray), and thoth is the creative side of mercury. this is probably why set destroys horus' left eye (this is thoth's eye). there are variations to the story, but the one I like the most is when thoth goes to restore the eye, it has been replaced, so he turns the eye into a serpent which is placed on the brow where "it could rule the whole world" making it the effective ruler of the world (eg. the all-seeing eye symbolism on the *one* dollar bill).

interestingly enough the set guy is perceived by the greeks as synonymous with typhon. typhon, I believe has [many more similarities to vulcan](!typhon-vulcan-similarity) than to thoth, actually, but the symbolism is clear that this is the "destructive aspect" of either mercury or vulcan[^1].

in the same way that different aspects are represented as the deity, sekhmet (then lion) is the "destructive" side of venus (1st ray), and hathor (the cow) is the creative side of venus.

ok, so that was the setup, because here's where it gets juicy...

in da-vinci's last supper, robert shows that there is an *eye of ra* above jesus, which I find interesting because I would have assumed that the eye of ra, which is associated with the goddess sekhmet/hathor would go over mary, and not over jesus. I would have guessed the eye of horus to go over jesus, because afterall, horus is the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity).

---

I don't really know how to express this next part very well, but I understand the symbolism there. I'll explain: I had a brain haemorrhage where my left-eye (thoth's eye) was disabled, and when it happened, I had a definite experience where I met jesus and he entered into my *heart*. this isn't an uncommon thing for people to experience relating to interactions with jesus. however, for me I had a paralysed side, and the key to "unlocking" the paralysis of my left-side, was to begin to learn to "accept" and integrate my emotions into my every-day experience. along the process (involving various psychedelics), I came to begin to perceive my right-brain (left-side) as a demanding little girl with insatiable desire. in berlin when I was going through various extraordinary experiences, learning, I associated this dorment partially paralysed side with the 1st ray (desire) female (emissive), eg. hathor/venus.

essentially, what I'm saying is that through various psychedelic experiences, I began to identify my left-side, which I personified originally as jesus, to later be this sekhmet/hathor 1st ray female that was sort of stuck inside of me. I always identified my right-side as vulcan, the husband of venus in mythology. in the sirian guide, vulcan is paired with saturn and venus in the triad, which is another weird thing too

anyway, that was a lot of symbols to explain that I don't find it weird that this picture da-vinci is identifies jesus as having the eye of ra (personfifed by hathor/venus), and not mary. it perfectly fits my experience with jesus, and then resulting paralysis of my left side (or eye of thoth).

if that myth has any value to it, then when thoth returns to restore my left eye, he will notice that another eye (developed by me) has regrown in its place, and so therefore the previously extracted left eye of thoth will transform into a serpent, being placed on the forehead "where it could rule the whole world."

let's just plug in the symbols here: set, the serpent symbology associated with the planet mercury (eg. the serpent nosebookers guys that are trying to run the show with their hermetic super powers), gets in a fight with horus over the throne of osiris (saturn), and set destroys horus' left thoth eye, forcing him to grow his own replacement. after growing his replacement the stollen left-eye from horus is turned into a serpent and used by nosebook so "it could rule the whole world."[^2]

---

there's another strange thing associated with the opposites found in these symbols, because in the zodiac, opposite the taurus (hathor) is the serpent and the eagle -- however, opposite the lion (sekhmet) is the symbol of the man (horus). this is probably the original distinction between the eye of ra symbolising the goddess (and is also called the eye of thoth[^3]) and opposite the eye of horus.

inside of the great pyramid (located in the ros-tau (taurus) mountains) is the symbol of the bull (hathor), yet very much out of the ordinary, is the the combination of these other two symbols just outside in the sphinx, eg. horemakhet or horus of the two horizons. which two horizons? well, logic says that the sphinx is most likely referring to when the sun (eye of ra) is rising in the east, man is facing to see it, while the part facing west, the hindquarters, is in the direction opposite, which is the constellation of the lion.

make what you want from it. it's all very weird to me.

[1]: the typhon guy is also banished by zeus to exist in tartarus, which is where the serpents are banished to live.

[2]: another variation of the story is one that is told by the festival of drunkenness illustrated by matt here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gWtr5lKycw) and @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP9-C8w5L1U), which appears to be a retelling of an ancient story where sekhmet destroys many people and ra satiates her with red beer. this was probably a prehistoric event, remembered only as myth. later after ra subdued her, she was known as the loving hathor[^4].

[3]: I find it very strange that the same symbol for the eye of ra (that is the light of the sun), is directly connected with the goddess personified as sekhmet/hathor, yet at the same time is connected with the moon in the symbolism for the eye of thoth. the personification of this eye as sekhmet (1st ray female) and as thoth (7th ray male) is interesting because these are the alpha and omega (the beginning and the end), the most extreme ends of duality coming together (the snake eating its tail); the hermaphodite (hermes/aphrodite fusion).

[4]: interestingly enough, the 18th dynasty saw a resurgance in the cult of the sphinx, which was about the time of the exodus, because the exodus seems to be correlated with the planet venus, which, if velikovski is correct, the events that took place are a kind of retelling of the story related in "the book of the heavenly cow" where sekhmet (as the eye of ra) is unleashed on humankind. at the same time (18th dynasty). at the same time, there was increased worship to anhur which is a *male* lion figure associated with war, so if the exodus is the time of the bronze age collapse, and then the following aryan invasion, or if seen symbolically, the beginning of the age of aries, a male lion figure in another variation of the myth instead goes searching for the eye (sekhmet or mehit). it all gets very complicated with egyptian myths, probably because they used pictures instead of names for the characters...


### 2020-11-02 03:51 - thinking about water and fire

a while back in a particularly scatter-brained entry (@[noseblog](2020-10-27 11:11)), I mentioned my theory of the differences between women and men biologically speaking. I realise that in today's society, one can claim any number of genders that they feel appropriate for their presentation to others, however biologically speaking, you either have an y-chromosome, or you don't. it's really that simple.

I believe that the y-chromosome is a pre-programmed emotional state machine (that men inherit from their father) and the x-chromosome is a meta state machine capable of tuning into whatever it wants to.

first of all, let me begin by expaining that I believe the emotion which a person is experiencing is a vibrating wave which, while sometimes feels more strongly in one location of the body than others (body memory), that's only evidence of more resonance in that area, and that this waveform is consistent throughout the whole body. additionally, I want to say that emotion, or your vibration has for men especially a lot of momentum to it, however women[^1] seem to be able to switch with sometimes almost no residual momentum. other times, they cannot switch so easily.

second, I want to note that in the that entry I also made the correlation between women and men and that this chromosomal difference is actually what makes one more "water" and the other more "fire"...

the fire can be seen easily as a strong peak amplitude waveform -- like you *really* want to do something. so it feels strong and "spikey" to me -- like almost some sort of aggitation. for a man this urge seems to come usually from the y, in the form of sex-drive, and the only thing that's holding them back is the opposite chromosome, which is in most cases the x, which is some sort of programmed meta-emotional state machine (MESM). obviously, the distinction for a woman is that both sides are x so both are programmed.

now contrast the feeling of water to the feeling of fire as an explanation for the differences between the xx and xy configuration. for water, the tendency is toward stillness, where you perturb a pool of water, it will return back to stillness with time. however, if you perturb a fire, it flares up bigger and burns away the fuel more rapidly. this relationship can be seen very easily with lesbian couples, who tend, if one of the women is not especially firey, toward stagnation or stillness. in contrast, many gay couples ... well you got sparks shooting all over the place, and there's a lot of rapid acceleration and burnout if one is not especially watery.

now, how do I relate this to desire. well, if desire is like a sharp peak in the vibration, almost as if someone has just plucked the string, then the opposite chromosome is designed to either amplify or to reduce the waveform. therefore, you can imagine that "unchecked desire" (that is, the emotional manifestation of desire) goes straight into action. often times, we try to quell these desires by blocking them. this seems to be essentially the action of the x and not the y. for men, the x seems to be built more as a kind reducer of vibration more than an amplifier, and it is through the cultivation of the feminine side, that the man learns to begin to amplify his creative, conceptual, and intuitive (vibrational, not-thought) side.

so imagine that you have a desire that is 5V, and you have a resistance circuit on the opposite chromosome of 3V, then you would experience 2V of desire. because it's vibrational, this waveform, even though it's 2V, will slowly build up to where it's big enough for one to take action on. the stronger you feel something, the more likely you are to take action.

it is for this reason that I do not believe that trying to quell one's desire is ever that effective of a method. it may work for a while as you apply the opposite wave to try and quell the desire, but you cannot destructively interfere with 100% of the waveform, meaning it will continue to grow, whether you like it or not.

most women (and some very repressed men) are taught to quell their desire and so every thing that they feel strongly, they immediately work against their own desire trying to quell it's intensity, meaning that many women have very strong x circuits which generate strong desire, and then on the opposite side have also very strong x circuits, which generate strong "resistance" (that is, the opposite waveform) to that desire. both men and women do this, but it's easier to see with women because they have two easily programmable circuits. in contrast, it appears like most men seem like they're trying to quell their "animal instincts".

the other way that people get around this desire spurting out everywhere is to partition it, and say, ok in these situations (environments), this desire is ok to amplify, and in these environments it's necessary to quell it.

any time that you are quelling your desire, you are working against yourself, and this is "split-energy", meaning it's going 5V in one way and 5V in the opposite direction, so no movement (or desire) is felt. again though, it's absolutely impossible to make that circuit complicated enough to perfectly destrctively interefere with that emotion so as to completely reduce it to 0V[^2] so its attraction power[^3] will continue to rise and it'll keep summoning more "non-physical energy" from your source toward the desire. the only way to truly quell the desire is instead find a way to transform that energy into something desired.

this universe is only addition, and it's the nature of these destructively interfering interactions which gives the illusion of entropy, however, everything is always getting more, and the *only* way to rid oneself of unwanted energy (desire, emotion, etc.), is to transform it into something desired to to redirect (dissipate) it into something compatible (vibrationally similar) with that energy. this means that only you can cause your own death by finding a way to feel opposite of how you want to feel, which is constantly going toward more (in both directions).

---

oops, derailed again; back on topic...

when reproduction happens, the sperm contains both x and y, so what seems to be happening[^4] (and this seems to be confirmed by my observation) is that the x is like the vibrational "guidance system" for the sperm, and the one that is most attracted (vibrsationally similar) to the egg's x frequency, so *ideally* the most vibrationally similar sperm will be the one that gets there first and "wins" (ideally). what seems to happen is that the transferred x MESM of the man is combined in the egg with the woman's present meta-state throughout the pregnancy. if the fetus is female, then it will inherit the MESM of the woman as well. it's unclear to me how the mutation occurs, but it seems that some sort of transformation of at least one of the x occurs and a amalgamate is formed as a result.

biologically, this whole process is not very clear to me, but what I do know is that some sort of upgraded (based on the woman's meta-state) MESM is transferred to the fetus. this MESM seems to be a combination of the man's x and the woman's x. for the female fetus, it seems like the same thing is happening, but don't know of both x's are modified, or just one. either way, the meta-state and the MESM seems to come from both.

the picture that I have is that it's most commonly found that one chromosome is usually the stronger of the physical/mundane desire and resistance, and the other is more often geared toward the "spiritual" or the improvement of the emotional body's desire and resistance. neither contains 100%, but it seems that one is often more stronger than the other. for men, the physical is usually mostly the y, and very little x. for women, the physical seems to be inherited mostly from her mother's x.

the other picture that has formed is that men seem to inherit, in some cases this very archaic MESM[^5], and I think some DNA is actually designed to perpetually keep men cycling around between terrible emotional states, because that's where the y has been programmed to operate. I have noticed that often times men with this "genetic disposition", which do not like to constantly feel bad, or need a break from constantly feeling bad, have to "switch" over to their x side, which in a lot of cases is mode feminine or childlike. this actually explains probably a lot of gay men, actually; they simply do not like feeling that archaic masculine programming, and instead opt for something a bit more flexible.

the other thing is that I'm noticing that women, who have been trained to quell their desire for so long are actually beginning to experience the opposite effect, because one cannot fully quell the desire to remove it. quelling it only reduces it tempoarily, and will return eventually stronger, meaning that women are beginning to have stronger and stronger desire than ever before, which means they're getting more aggressive. this is likely the cause of some gay men too, coming from strong emotional stresses in their environment, usually from someone else's MESM, like an overbearing mother or father.

I believe that both our environment, our own focus, and others around us program and influence our x (MESM), meaning that as a child be begin to resonate with the infuences of the environment, those around, (or the preprogrammed y) by default, but one can consciously influence that frequency into a different place by finding a way to feel something different, using physical conditions (the most influential are drugs, sex, and rock and roll), or the power of your focus (what you're giving your attention to with your thoughts and physical senses) to change how you feel. this is, essentially programming your MESM, or your x (if you want to look at it biologically[^6])

---

ok, so let's get back to some ways to use these ideas, because both the x and the y are programmable, however the y seems much more stagnant.

I have been constantly seeing that the "future" for the female species is to become more fire-like -- that is, more aggressive and emotionally potent. what this means is that there is less resisted energy, meaning that the waveform will have more strong peaks that are uninhibited (unresisted) due to environmental propgramming. I also belive that it's going to be the future for men to become more water-like as well.

what I mean by fire-like is that states are not resisted as much, so you're not working against yourself so much. you're more closer to 100% inside of the state, rather than trying to quell your own emotion because of strange beliefs.

what I mean by water-like is that both chromosomes are flexible enough (meaning easy enough to reprogram) to be able to accomodate more desired states. what the ability to reprogram and switch easily means, is that it's easier to *transform* -- not quell -- the emotion into a more desirable state or better feeling. I don't mean becoming complacent, but using the power of your perception to transform things which don't feel good into new perceptions which feel better.

this has obvious implications for everyone's evolution, but what it means for women, is that as they become more and more "unresisted", they'll quickly gain that fire that they're looking for, and this sounds super woman-power-like, but they won't need anything external to get it. for men, it means that by default the more water-like men will be able to transform their own y-chromosome much more rapidly, allowing for their own rapid improvement and that their sons will automatically come pre-installed with this program. obviously, genetically the men that are capable of feeling better will far outperform the ones that cannot find ways to feel good. this means that the coming evolution of the male species will, by "survival of the fittest" cull the ones that are not water-like.

this is almost certainly the coming transformation from aquatic ape to aqarian man.

---

what I essentially did, was to redefine the fire and water ideas a bit. one can see that with the above perception, the new stagnant man is now the one *without* water capabilities. all of humankind will become more fire-like as one reduces their resistance to their own emotional states. it's going to be a rapid evolution[^7].

[1]: and some effeminate men too, however someone sensitive, like a child can feel the underlying emotion, behind the performed emotion. this is the distinction I make, because it seems that while a man can switch between emotions, the residual is evident, yet with women, after switching, my experience has shown that it seems to be less or almost no residual in some cases.

[2]: actually, not only is it impossible, but additionally, there's another factor as well, which most do not really understand because modern electricity theory does not talk about it, however, if you were able to destructively interfere with a signal perfectly, it hasn't completely destroyed all motion. when destructively interfering, there is always another thing formed perpendicular to the direction of the current, which in the case of a wire, the majority of this energy is lost, leaving the wire radially perpendicular to the wire. this energy isn't completely dissipated, and you could consider this something more closer to "static" electricity.

[3]: I don't know how to explain this concept. it may be magnetism, but when something is destructively interfered with, it creates something which is not immediately attractive, probably becasue it's perpendicular to the direction of the current flow, but it appears to attract more current. I believe that if you could get this going the right way, you would easily create "over unity" -- which is actually the proof of what I've been doing this whole time.

[4]: I don't know how it works, and apparently science [has some misconceptions about it too](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC19448), which I didn't fully understand, so I'll just write what my intuition is telling me (this whole thing is a theory anyway), and then modify this concept as I understand it better. I don't know if it's transmitted biologically or frequencially between mates.

[5]: I use myself for example in this case. when I was very young, I was a totally out of control emotionally, trying to shut things down and I really liked guns and powerful things (not saying that's bad, just guns and someone incapable of controlling their emotions is probably a bad combination). I had, in my own estimation, very awful original DNA, however I believe my own focus has allowed the transformation of this DNA into something much better. I have essentially reprogrammed my physical or y to be a much more well-adapted MESM.

[6]: likely a lot of the "junk" DNA is actually the more transient or "temporary" programming for the MESM, or perhaps additional frequencies designed to influence the state changes and other environmentally-specific threshold tweaks.

[7]: a word of caution to men wanting quell their evolution[^8] by using some external means to feel better than they really do. the contrast between states is important. you don't want to be stoned all the time; I recommend turning it off so that you modify your y with your own perception.

[8]: in ~12ky, when the golden-age begins to wane again, those with the fragile y's requiring good feeling fuel will need to ensure this resource remains available, meaning that they will remain superior in as long as they can continue to maintain their external source of good feeling, but if it goes away, those with that fragile y-chromosome will go the way of the dinosaur, almost like, all of a sudden the gravity on the planet increases, immediately landlocking many flying creatures, now too heavy to maintain flight. don't let the superior conditions lull you into complacency. allow yourself to gain the capability to navigate in less than ideal conditions, too -- or just don't worry about it, letting the evolution do all the work for you[^9].

[9]: this is an interesting thing to think about. dinosaurs, which were mostly reptiles, after some shift in density (gravity), they were forced to either transform into a birds (like an eagle), or to continue on as a reptile, but instead of walking or having a long neck, instead are confined to crawling on the ground (like a lizard or serpent) and "eating the dust of the earth"

### 2020-11-01 13:24 - more ideas on the MESM

in the previous entry (or maybe it was the one before), I was talking about how someone sensitive like a child, is able to detect the underlying emotion in a man. I was speaking somewhat from experience, but I was more referring to my own condition. you will notice that more often than not in the past, when an action happens, let's say someone is doing something unfair to me or whatever, then my left-side will shake, while my right side remains (usually) unaffected. you can perceive this as essentially what I have been pre-prpgrammed to feel (fear or anger), and what my meta-state is on top of it. there is residual. I can't just feel calm when my base programming is telling me to go to fear state

---

explanation of how the state machine works. it's not action based, and emotions (or concepts) are both the destinations and the states. the different frequencies it contains seems to mean that the chromosome itself will fold differently in different frequency ranges. different states are possible within each fold structure (or vibrating structure). again, no state is really ever held for any length of time, so you could consider a group of states, or a loop in states to be the frequency base of that state -- like if you play a chhord on a piano, each of these strings are vibrating independently at some speed, so you could simpulate that chord in a single string structure if you modeled that the string were able to consciously transfer between two states (on and off) in a series which would make the same vibrational pattern that the chord makes. ultimately that sequence of states will loop back to the beginning of the sequence, meaning that the sequence of states there is like a way to model a multi-string chord. obviously, the faster the state changes happen (the higher the frequency the ESM is running at, the more strings in the chord can be simulated).

if you look at the quantity of the strings as essentially as the edges of a regular polyhedra (n-gon), then you draw the lines between them, like you're making the metatron's cube, then you will see that the more edges that outer polyhedra has, the more definition the shape of the emotion has. I realised after getting into robert's head that you have to think of these things visually, kind of like what paveen was showing as the yantras embedded in the structures. these are vibrational states, and probably those structures were designed to operate at that frequency.

the real breakthrough for me was seeing that the more higher frequency gets, it's just a jumble of more lines, so to make sense of it, you have to see the line segments between and *bold* some of them, then shapes begin to emerge. if you turn on the ESM at some portions of the line, and then off at other portions of the line, in sync/harmony with it's base frequency, an image begins to emerge.

when I was talking about the archaic DNA, you could imagine that some draconic DNA is only capable of maintaining operation at a certain frequency range. if you go too low, a whole bunch of stuff starts falling apart, and if you go to high, again things start falling apart, so for example, once we surpass the frequency speed that was present during the time of atlantis, then trying to run this DNA at that faster speed could feel pretty bad. this perfectly explains why a lot of these archaic types want to constantly slow things down. the reason why too, is because no matter how much they try to quell those impulses/states, the LOA and the attractiveness of things (only add) means that no matter how much they try, both their energy trying to go at the faster speed, and also the frequency of the environment is continually becoming more.

in ~12ky when the golden age begins to wane again, when we reach the furthest most point again (when was that, aries?) the earth will not be in nearly as much of a unenergised state as it were before unless some structure (like a pyramid) were to force the planet to be even more out of alignment to the sun (castrated), capable of receiving less and less energy from polar alignment with the the sun, only receiving the most energy during the equinox. obviously, the most out of alignment a planet can be, would be to have it tilted perpendicular to its orbit, not having any polar alignment at all with the sun (like uranus). we'll have to see as we approach the golden age, but it may be planned to construct another pyramid that forces the earth more out of alignment with the sun after its next pole flip[^1].

at any rate, the energy on the planet will continue to become more and more. it came to my attention that these discussions seem to have some strange resonance with my inquiry to robert about zeus having vulcan construct the new female prototype (pandora) from the clay of the earth as a punishment for prometheus giving humans fire (heart ability to navigate time reality[^2] with their emotions[^3]), and so the obvious desirable thing to do will be to find a way of overriding the x-chromosome with technology, or forcing it to be subservient to some other artificial state machine, forcing the DNA to run at the desired (programmed) speed, instead of it being constatntly subject to the fluctuating environmental conditions. I mean, why not really kick the can down the road, right?? why not. I'm all for it. it just means more contrast. I have another idea to create even more contrast also which I will outline soon[^4]. at any rate, it seems like the goal is to continue to let the serpents delay their extinction for as long as possible, continually finding an out for them. I imagine that they'll eventually be forced to live inside of the machines, having their emotional/energy structure become completely artificial (actually that reminds me of star wars: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD2UrB7zepo)).

I'm all about trying to find a way for them to find a way to artificially create the "ideal" energetic conditions for their species. I think it's good that they need to try and figure out how to survive in contiually increasing energetic conditions. the increase will never stop, and it'll only get more and more, so they should(?) try to find a way to survive it and delay their extinction until we have an appropriate (robotic) replacement for them.

speaking of extinction, if you think about the x chromosome as a vibrational structure, which vibrates at a rate specific to a consciousness stream, then you can imagine that the MESM created by the sperm and the egg, create a sort of vibrational vortex which kind of like "sucks in" a "soul" resonant with that MESM when the "soul" taking physical expression begins its consciousness (all of your individual cells are conscious).

so, like the dinosaur's transition into the modern reptile species, with some upgrading to the bird -- as soon as there is no longer a physical structure capable of giving that consciousness stream a suitable resonant form inside of a MESM, then it's forced to transcend its form into a new one. the dinosaur's extinction wasn't a bad thing. it created two entirely new species from its extinction. some species (like the cockroach) have seen zero improvements over millions of years, because their function continues to need expression and no real improments on their design have been needed for them to continue that function.

therefore, if the function of the form is still desirable, then mother nature provides a way for that form to continue its expression without going extinct.

so, what I'm saying is, for as long as it's desirable to have people inhibiting the energetic expression (manifestation), then there will be no extinction. for me their function is highly desirable. last night, I was thinking about how much more "boring" it will be when I no longer have someone trying to hold me back. if no one finds value in it, I certainly will, so in some random universe it'll probably just be me and the reptiles in an infinite loop gaining more and more power until they literally cannot hold on anymore. it would be pretty boring with just me though, and diversity is very desirable, so that won't happen, but for as long as I exist (which sounds like is eternal), their function will alwasy at least be desired by me, so I doubt their full extinction. they must however continue to upgrade into ever more powerful/superior forms to keep up, though (which is what they want).

[1]: I can see why this may be desirable, and I actually think that this is already planned, and it may even be the case that this same technique utilised to not only keep the planet from having its poles flip, but also to continually receive less and less energy from the sun. this will force the planet to be the creator of its own reality (environment), and not to rely on the sun. it also has the advantage of allowing the archaic DNA to continue to exist on this planet for quite a few more 24ky sirius cycles.

[2]: in a future entry I want to explore this further begause as robert was talking (especially when he mentioned that he drew the I-ching symbol), I could see how saturn, having a hexagon at its north pole (south too?) constructs time from these fractal waves in a similar manner. this time sequence is essentially like the fractal ESM for the solar system, and it may have something to do with its conjuction with jupiter to set this (last time they were conjuct was 2000-05-28 and next time the saturn/jupiter ESM update will happen on 2020-12-21). this sets the time sequence which saturn continues on replaying over and over. it's a fractal resonance with itself, as demonstrated by terence mckenna's timewave, and this must be how reaching the long-count reset, as prophesied by the mayans, indicating that it seems to have been delayed 8 years (two sets of 4 years), through some form of time travel, reseting the sequence back 4 years twice. I can't imagine (yet) how this is done, or why it's 4 years, but it seems relevant.

[3]: you navigate time with your heart. I am sure of this. I also know that it is connected to the emotions, which provide the transition states. it seems significant to me that this whole thing began when I accepted jesus into my heart back in april/may of 2000 and I'm also fairly sure that the first delay of 4 years, I believe happened in 2001-09-11, and perhaps the second in 2004-03-11 (not sure about that one though). it seems that these sudden changes (reset back) in the emotional psyche of the planet were similar enough to a resonance on the sequence some time back.

[4]: I have reason to believe that I will find a way to, because I have a whole hemisphere disabled (remember the eye of horus thing), that I'm essentially regrowing that whole right-hemisphere's capability in the left hemisphere. my brain is adapting. I think it's also quite possible that I might actually create two more chromosomes in the process. I don't know how it will be, probably xxxy[^5] (I dunno), because that would be like the hermaphordite (xx + xy). however, the cool thing is that if that happens, then we could create a new hybridisation with the apes of the earth which have two more than we do. I think it could work. I'll fill the idea in a little more in the future as I begin to see this clearer.

[5]: likely what is happening is that because my right is disabled, I'm either creating a "virtual" right side or I'm merging both sides' function into the left, so all of me is on the left there. I don't know much about genetics, but I think the chromosomes come in pairs, so each one needs a match. if I have somehow created a new "virtual" (or real) implementation, giving me an extra something, then it needs to be matched. with my left-side disabled, then the autonomic function associated with that previous right-hemisphere, will begin to rebuild in the left, however the right side is still operational and physical, just not accessible by me (nosebook has it under their control), so I'm essentially getting my left to do the work of both sides, which should create like an "unmatched pair" or some sort of charge imbalance (who knows how this stuff replicates), and then you can imagine that later when I'm procreating with the girls, both xy from me will be used because I've implemented both in one hemisphere, and both xx from her will be used as well, making xxxy. probably this will result in the child retaining the normal two hemispheres, but then they will each be divided into two more (probably forward and reverse, matching the visual (physical) and neo (desire) cortexes). that makes sense to me because the neo is where desire originates from, and the visual is at the opposite end of the brain, where physical stuff is perceived. typically, in the middle is where the motor function (or e-motion comes from, which is why it's so easy to read someone's emotion by their animation). anyway, I dunno really how it will be, but if I had to guess, this would be my best guess...

### 2020-11-01 ??:?? - the different versions of moses and non-linear time
### 2020-10-25 ??:?? - horus the aquarian deity
### 2020-10-12 ??:?? - a few more bad (or good, you decide) ideas

### 2020-09-20 ??:?? you say all manifestations are a win-win huh? what about the serious stuff like murder or rape or slavery or something

slavery

superior race -> but under what conditions?

war of the titans.
zeus & cronos battle (eg. serpent & eagle battle)
one thing I don't really get is why the 18th dynasty (hyksos/semites), made the sphinx such a big deal. sphinx may have also been a falcon or eagle previously. additionally, I don't understand where the lion symbolism comes into play (lion of judah)
