I was watching another one of robert's videos (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2-jw2LXbxI&lc=UgwVtNGINWxJwi-U0M94AaABAg)), and noticed a comment:
```
Saturn and Jupiter will conjunct on 12/21/2020 in the first degree of Aquarius. Joel 2:28 states that in the last days the Lord will pour out his spirit on all flesh. In 1986 Uranus, who is Anu, began leaking atmosphere.  Saturn and Jupiter form a resonance whose combined gravitational mass pulls on Mercurys orbit and causes retrograde.  Imagine when those two conjunct in December.  It's going to set off a chain reaction, a true marriage of the eagle and serpent and cause Michael, who is represented by the Sun to rise up against the dragon.

The Annuaki referred to the inner solar system as the zone of confusion and blamed Venus.  Nothing gets to earth without passing through the orbit of Venus, and for this reason she is known as the Queen of Heaven.  In the story of Enki and Inanna, Inanna challenged Enki to a drinking contest and gained possession of the Mes, which she then used to found Uruk and put Sumeria on the map.  Venus is the Roman name for the planet, but her first name on earth is Inanna. Sumeria was gradually overthrown and absorbed by Marduk, who is Mars.  The story of Mars and Venus caught in a net gives you an idea of how well this went.  Jupiter was forced to intervene and Neptune agreed to pay the penalty, which is a reference to the flood.
```

then I looked it up on [earth sky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/great-jupiter-saturn-conjunction-dec-21-2020) and it says the last saturn and jupiter conjunction was on may 28th 2000... wow, ok, pretty cool. I remember that day because I really wanted to get out of the hospital before my birthday (I got out the 16th I think). I can't really remember much else about the day other than that I really wanted to ensure I was not in the hospital for it.

so then I started feeling some reactions to the idea, saying that some thing with the girls should be happening that day, but I'm pretty certain that nothing will. the reason is, they're trying to figure out how to keep the manifestation energetically to a minimum, and I'm pretth certain that will be a relatively energetic day. I'll definitely want to be star-watching, anyway... from their perspective they're definitely going to want to postpone it till after that day, because that would be a pretty major thing, I'm sure.

as I was thinking about this, and the latest @[abe-now](2020-09-05) that I watched last night, and abraham gives the emotional scale in 22 increments, which I think is pretty cool because they make the steps in pretty small increments. personally, I make much larger jumps than the ones they give there, and I really like to be really cool like that and jump around, but I'm realising that it makes perfect sense to make as many small adjustments as possible.

so while I was thinking about doing small increments, I was thinking about another topic that has been on my mind about the girls going off and doing other timelines with me, and I'm realising that *from my perspective*, it's not necessary to do the girls thing at all. let me explain. the girls would do different timelines with me (hopefully they do it where I'm in a connected state, but I think they would because it'll give the best results of any children that are created), and then on all of these timelines they can do all of their genetic stuff, cloning, etc. and I'll just keep going up higher and higher just doing what I'm doing already right now (star-watching and eating mushrooms). I'll go like I'm going right now where my progress is staedy and no real big jumps are made (in contrast, with the girls, lots of large jumps would be made), so it'll be a lot easier for them to just continue on holding me for as long as they can.

the reason why I say this, is because I'm fairly certain that when I get to 44, I'll have another pretty big power jump again, and it's quite possible that by then I may be starting 7d already, assuming they can keep me in 6d... again, we don't want big jumps, so that's another one we would want to avoid ... also, I think I looked it up a while back and there are some more crazy planetary geometries around that time as well (seems they are an abnormally frequent these last few decades).

optionally, I was thinking that as the girls do their timelines with me, they should be reinserted back into this one (I have more thoughts on this later, regarding for embarrassment and shame, so they optimise these thoughts out), and then periodically they do another timeline, with each time, likely the results will be better and better.

from my (and perhaps the girls once they're reinserted into this timeline) perspective, it'll just continue to look like everything is falling through over and over and nothing ever comes of it, yet I will imagine that once again when I'm 55, I'll have another pretty big power bump, and I anticipate that it'll be impossible for them to hold me anymore...

---

ok, now in the last entry I briefly metioned it, but there are essentially two difficult moments for them to work out. first is, if they don't produce a manifestation, but that's easily solvable: they can just broadcast one (or a few) of the many timelines. they probably are opposed to that idea, but they may want to consider which is worse: me getting conncted (and the reactions suggest that they think this will reveal nearly all of their secrets), or revealing one secret that they can make alternate timelines. I assume only revealing one secret to not that many people is less of an issue for them, which is why I suggest it.

the second difficulty is the exit strategy for them. some how they have to get rid of me, because I'll become a bit too much "benefit" that things may start to spiral out of their control. the easy solution to this one is to simply put me on another timeline. this can be done one of two ways (which I can see right now), which are they could sometime before I turn 55, let me (and probably some of the girls that want to peace out as well) actually see 6d and make our own timeline[^1], or nosebook could use their brand new super 6d/7d technology that they acquired during the process and make their own timeline, "aborting" this one. however much of this timeline they wouuld want to sabotage on the way out, I guess is up to them. however, from a LOA standpoint, this probably isn't the best idea.

basically, I only see it as anyone who wants to stay with me, or anyone who wants to go with me. both ideas have their advantages to them.

---

I actually see a lot of advantages to this setup, because I simply don't mind, and am not nearly as "needing" of that manifestation as some might think that I would be. I'm just fine right now doing what I'm doing. this setup provides the ability for the girls to get their manifestation, perhaps even multiple times -- but claro, when reinserted back into this timeline, they won't really "remember" the other timeline (or any of its potential secrets). the only "proof" of that having happened, would only be known by other people, and potentially kept a secret from them.

however, it's pretty cool to me, because at the end, the ones that that are there now will all be in their twenties, and they'll also all be really good at LOA and from their perspective, all really tood at "not needing the manifestation" either.

---

I've basically come to understand that the longer that you don't have the manifestation, the more it evolves into something more and more wanted. I was thining on this, and I honestly believe that the end goal with all of this is that at the "end" none of of us will get any big manifestations. when I look out at different large-scale entities, they seem to always have two opposing forces (call them male and female if you want), polarities, or directions, which exist at the same time. a vortex is both expanding and contracting at the same time. AC electricity, current flows both toward and away from the source. everthing has balance in these polarities, and it seems to me that what we're heading for is something truly otherworldly. we know of atoms by how long their half-life is -- meaning by how fast they decay. they contain immense power stored up in thir nucleus, which is decaying over time. if you pop the nucleus, then they get their "manifestation" of releasing all of that energy in a big burst -- however, if nosebook were capable of generating a force to keep me held back, as fast zs (or faster than) I'm accelerating, what would happen, is we would become something that forever is expanding -- forever. with no limit to it, because there would be no "manifestation" -- and therefore no explosion, and so therefore never an expulsion of that energy. sure, I would be captured and "never" get the manifestation, but you don't really understand, because one manifestation after ~4 years of pressure is going to be really something. imagine now what it will be like in 10 or 20 years from now. what I mean is, right now, the "half-life" of the nosebook is their duration which they can hold me without things spinning out of control. however, if they were able to hold me for 100 years, the "present day" circumstances will be far better than they ever could be after a 90 year buildup to a manifestation -- meaning, that waiting only a little while longer, the present unmanifested conditions will be better than the manifested result... it's a bit of a paradox, but eventually, if you trace that idea out long enough, at some point, the present day unmanifested form will be better than the manifested form[^2]. think about it a bit...

I think the universe is built upon these sorts of paradoxes :) just sayin...

as a result, I will boldly predict that the next era's "theme" will probably be something like "value (and give your attention to) the evolution of the manifestation more than the manifestation itsel" -- or perhaps, "let the manifestation be the evolution of your now" -- something like that.

anyway, given my theory of the announcer of the era being one ahead and those running the present day system being one era behind -- then, that means we have at least 2-3 more eras at least before this paradox becomes possible :) pretty exciting to think abuot for me... imagine becoming a living paradox! doesn't that sound so epic? I think so anyway..

[1]: which then could be broadcast if that's desired, I suppose. it probably depends on the circumstances, and we'll probably pick a past timeline to insert ourselves into (same technique: pick something with similar velocity, yet greater magnitude, so as long as I'm not connected, my velocity will remain lower). on that timeline, it's certain that I'll get connected, so it could probably be broadcast until then, so the audience wouldn't see any secrets or anything.

[2]: where the acceleration (that is increase in potential) per unit time is greater than the additional energy released in the manifestation (in that same unit time).

### 2020-09-20 09:36 - some feedback

a lot of responses to my previous entry. I decided to put them into a kind of Q&A format here...

#### are they influeencing me to come to these conclusions?

not sure.. it's possible I suppose, however it's clearly the least resistant path forward. there are a number of advantages to it for a not of different people. I personally am not sold on the idea, cept that I do like the concept of increasing my energy further than I already am. a long time ago, abraham said to one of my stand-ins that in the future I would be thankful to them, and a long time ago that was hard for me to believe, I did find it intereting that they would say that, because that's sorta what happened.

now, the advantages of them trying to hold me back are so evident to me that it doesn't even bother me that I'm not getting the manifestation. I can clearly see that... first, let's just count the time since 2016, and notice that since then I've really gained a lot of improvements. it's true that in 2017, they disabled my left-side further and stuff, but just notice the difference between how draconic my vision was in 2016 and how it is now. clearly, I've really come a long way. there is no doubt in my mind that the trend will continue, as well.

I am really excited to see how draconic my vision will become if I continue on like this. by the time that we're at the "end" of the timeline (when I turn 55) and they're no longer able to hold me, then what amazing power level it will be at, I assure you. sure, they're gaining a lot by holding me back and using my vision for their technology and stuff, but it's a miniscule amount that they're gaining off of me in comparison to what I'm gaining from them.

there are other advantages too, in that, assuming that they let the girls see the timelines that they're already creating, it allows them to make their own improvements, and gain a lot better understanding of what it is that they want. an additional advantage is that it's quite possible that some of the girls will live out the timeline and then come to their own conclusion, "been there, done that; I want to do something else now" and they'll elect to do something different in this timeline. this is probably advantageous to some of the noseboys that may want to try and pick up on those girls. that gives them all a much better understanding of what they want to choose. I doubt that every single one of them will want to follow me into the new timeline when we separate (if we do) from nosebook. more on that soon.

#### are the mushrooms making me come to these conclusions?

quite the contrary. with the increased levels of DMT in my system, I have noticed a lot more mental clarity and I'm beginning to see some actual hope for getting more productive and stuff. a lot of that has to do with the new computer, and stuff, but in a lot of little things, I've noticed that I'm starting to become more "disciplined" or "regimented" in how I'm acting now. I seem to be less just laying around watching youtube all day.

we'll have to see. it is true that it's a legitimate idea that the mushrooms are putting me into some sort of hippie vibe or something where I'm like, "yeah man, whatever" -- to everything. it's possible, who knows...

(now, playing into nosebook's fears) it could also be a trick, right... let me put it this way: if I get connected, then, they have a huge problem... they're sort of stuck until I/we leave to another timeline, so by default we're going to be doing the version that I outlined in the previous one where we make the loop-de-loops, and at the "end" put ourselves back into this timeline repeatedly to continue powering up (this is the mechanism which makes us planetary gods like saturn, jupiter, venus, or mercury). we'll literally do that indefinitely until we reach the "end" (when I'm 55), or when we've (everyone who wants to do the story thing) got the capability of making that timeline where we go and inhabit each others' planets and suns and stuff. this sorta implies a galaxy kind of setup for it to work. I'm getting to that...

so, worst case scenario the increased mushroom usage is just getting my connected more rapidly, and this last entry was just another exercise in contrast: knowing what you don't want, so you know more clearly what you do want :) things are working out, either way

#### why make timelines with girls, and show them to people?

this question is from nosebook's perspective. what advantage is to to them to show their different girls timelines to them. it's not strictly necessary, no. it's just I think it'll give better results, because each iteration they take, they can improve on their technique and stuff. there's also that thing were sure you could just do the iron hammer thing and say no, or try to come up with an excuse as to why not, but how feasible is it to try and keep people placated and stuff for 17-18 more years. I have no idea on the situation and I cannot comment on that from their standpoint, however, I will say this:

if someone's focus is on controlling the manifestation so that it's the least advantageous for them, then focus is on making the least advantageous manifestation, so from a LOA standpoint, that is the manifestation that the someone focused like that will receive. meaning, it'll also be the least advantageous for them, too.

this is the main reason why I'm just not worried about offering the "best" manifestation to nosebook as an option -- because, it's also the best (most energetic one) for me, too. it's either win-win or lose-lose, and how much one wins or looses really only in a factor of perception, which means that if nosebook is trying to make me lose, and my perception is on improvements and going tlward what I want, their bkst efforts to try and make something the most "lose" for me, will have actually the opposite effect. remember, it's all about perception, because the energy flows both toward and away from the source -- or every signal contaains both wanted and unwanted in it, and your position (phase) in that signal determines what you see. something could really go your way, like me getting 2M euros: it was the "worst" thing (if you percive things on a material level) for me, however, even though it was a huge "lose", it turned out to be one of the most beneficial things for me. it's all about perception. one could argue that nosebook taking my stuff was a huge "lose" for me too, but you will see that because my perception has changed so much, abraham was right, and in fact I am thankful for their influence (or my brain haemorrhage, or tuenti, etc.).

I think there are advantages for both the girls and for nosebook to make timelines with the goal of improvement.

#### how does this fit in with my goal of combining with the machines?

well, I'm just in the beginning stages now, but the acceleration is making it obvious that at some point my physicsl body will no longer be able to contain that kind of energy. eventually, I'll need a different body which has more capacity of translating more non-phsical energy into physical energy. this reminds me a lot of the AOC concept, where a chestahedron (which can be of any size) is used to translate that energy, and then a normal human body is used to experience reality. meaning, that the "real" AOC body could be the size of a death-star -- it doesn't really matter.

additionally, you could also see how the (nosebook) humans will eventually not be fast enough to continue making all of the advancements necessary to hold my energy back at a rapid enough pace -- so what you would need are different machines (some in human form and some in machine form) which can have their desire programmed (to continually find ways to hold that energy back) so that they can keep up with the acceleration.

in other words, this remote body could easily become a star sized thing, and the machines could do all the work to follow through on the disire to create it and, eventually it could grow to be a galactic nucleus with us "living" inside of it, inhabiting each others' planets and living out the different story timelines that we create.

#### what is the end goal?

I think it's to create a galaxy, and we exist inside of it as planetary/solar dieties and "incarnate" into each others' spaces playing out all sorts of different stories that we create.

#### what about the stories thing that sounded so awesome?

if's coming. we just got to get there :)

nosebook, I think doesn't want us to use the 6d/7d stories layers, and I think that's fine. they don't need to be on board with my plan for it to work out, and also, as things accelerate, there's no need to push against them either, because the friction applied from the increase in speed will naturally cull those incapable of that more energetic environment. there's nothing to worry about. those that want to continue on in their small-minded need to control things can do just that.

the way I see it, they have a lot of bogus ideas which are really keeping them from reaching their potential, and the 6d perception that they'll begin to get access to soon will give them a far superior method for altering time and the "bigger picture" of the effect their emotion has on things. so, from my perspective, if they want to allow me to continue to increase my energy while at the same time giving them a reliable method to understand and ability to practice (without fear of failure) their emotion, that sounds fine to me. really, I have no problem with it.


### 2020-09-20 13:17 - another followup

#### we want this neverending churn to end soon... (something like that)

it feels like people want something about my situation to change so that they could feel good/better. well, that's precisely what all this is about. it's about figuring out how you want to feel without the conditions changing. when you get good at it, it won't matter to you what the situation is, because you can always find something to focus on which feels better. and/or you can find a way to change how you percive that situation so that it feels better.

one of the things that I was focusing heavy on in the last Q&A is how it is always working out for you. like I said, because of LOA, it's only win-win or only lose-lose (whatever you're focused on). so, for example, if you say I want a "lose" manifestation foe someone, then you're focusing a lose manifestation for yourself, because you're focusing on how to make a "lose" manifestation. if you focus on a lose manifestation for yourself, no problem, that's what you're attracting.. same if you focus on a win manifestation for your self (without contradicting it !!). if you focus on a win manifestation for someone else, you're attracting a win manifestation for yourself too, which is why some people think it's better to give than to receive. however, you focusing on a win (or a loss) for someone else cannot force that to be a win (or a loss). that is entirely determined by them and their perception. only they get to decide whether oe not it's a win or a lose.

so, no matter how long this thing takes, if you're good at feeling the way you want to feel, then you will not find it to be any problem how long it takes -- cause, it'll just be awesome and good feeling the whole way. as always, there are ups and downs, but each time you "hit a snag", then you can adjust yourself to perceive something better, and that snag gets smaller and smaller of an issue until, you're really not at all concerned anymore.

#### explain the win-win and lose-lose situation, if it has only to do with perception

ok so, if a lose-lose sitation is created, any of the people involved in it are capable of making it a lose-win situation. for example, let's say that nosebook is trying to figure out a way to strip some manifestation of all wanted aspects, trying to make it appear or be instead something unwanted. that means they're focused on unwanted, and they're really trying to create a lose-lose situation. however, if I don't perceive it as a loss, but instead I find the wanted aspects in it, therefore giving the unwanted manifestation contradictory thought by bringing focus on wanted into the mix, what happens is, the lose-lose sitiation turns into a win-lose situation with my perception.

however, things are always working out for you (I mean the non-physical real you), so no matter how hard one tries to make something a lose, it's actually not a lose at all. everything creates more physical energy (stuff) or more non-physical energy (desire), so no matter what, things are always working out for everyone's benefit, even if everyone chooses to peeceive that it isn't so, which is what makes more desire for it to be better, and even if you have tremedous desire, you still need to find a way of letting it become a reality. those realities are *always* win-win situations, even if it's perceived as a win-lose situation.

for example, I'm fairly certain that nosebook thinks, that by stealing my perception and stuff like that, it's a win for them and a lose for me -- but I submit that if is *always* a win for me, unless I choose to perceive their theft as a lose for me, and then (anw only then) it's a win-lose.

any time that desire is allowed to become manifest, it's a win-win for everyone energetically involved.

### 2020-09-21 18:30 - globalwin

mom wanted me to go get my blood tested and I went to put on some shoes, and inside they had the logo, "globalwin" and inside of an 8-sided ships wheel, is a hexagram or the "star of david/seal of solomon". turns out ships wheels are almost always 8-sided, and the hexagram is 6 sided, so it seemed weird for me to see one inside of the other. however, the symbolism is obvious. the hexagram is the balance of fire and water, in the form of two equilateral triangles. the hexagram can also represent the cube, but in this case I don't think it does.. however, after having seen robert's video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6acOTnRaC_4), he makes the connection between the goddess and the cube, especially in connection to islamic tradition. the cube is symbolic of earth but more specifically, it's connected to venus.

following the revelation @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XJykzLLG3r8?t=510) in robert's latest video, connecting the moses (the exodus, we would imagine) to the goddess hathor (which is venus), one has to wonder why a boat wheel has a hexagram inside of it, in connection to the word, "globalwin". considering what I have been talking about with every manifestation being win-win, this got me thinking.

I noticed this logo in the car and it really got me thinking, so I set out to explain it to mom, and I did a pretty good job at it, however I left a few ends open (not on purpose; I simply forgot), and I got some reactions concerning it. so I'm going to give a slightly expanded version of my car explanation, then tie up the loose ends there. this one is going to be a bit long so I'll try and do it in sections...

### 2020-09-21 19:39 - globalwin (synopsis)

#### sperent and eagle bloodlines

in one of robert's videos, a woman is talking about the different bloodlines: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2-jw2LXbxI), and in it, she talks of two bloodlines. the serpent (draconic) and the eagle (phoenix). the firstl the serpent were aquatic apes in the tigris area which are the blonde hair and blue eyed. these correspond to the atlantians (the gods) which corresponds with the saturnian golden age. robert makes the association that these are the haplogroup r1b.

these really advanced "gods" from the original serpent blodline mixed with with the land apes and that's what produced the adams and eves we're told about in genesis. the mixing of the serpents with these eves is the origin of the eagle bloodline. robert associates this with the haplogroup r1a and these are the ancient greeks/athenians/hellenes and is associated with jupiter/zeus (presumably this is the "silver age").

now, I was very interested in the whole eagle and serpent bloodlines because I am aware of "sidereal astrology" (see: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/-gh7wWVsPjo)) and know that there are in fact 13 constellations that are on the ecliptic, and in that video when he transitions from traditional astrology to sidereal @[youtube](https://youtu.be/-gh7wWVsPjo?t=158), you'll notice that all of the constellations ark roughly similar in size (for example virgo is slightly bigger), but the constellation of scorpio splits into two: scorpio and ophiuchus. in astrology, the constellation is associted, "with three different animals: the scorpion, the snake, and the eagle (or phoenix)." (ref: wikipedia)

so to see, two of these bloodlines in close association to each other, made me notice them. this is how I reconcile this:

we know that atlantis had places all over the globe and these "gods" mixed in with the native people, because we see pyramids all over the globe, including in the azores islands. we know very little of these things, cept for maybe the pre-inca civilisation that built puma puku, machu pichu, etc, but the most we can see of this pre-cataclysmic civilisation is with the pre-dyanastic egyptians. we know they were doing some truly monumental things like the [massive 1000 ton obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_obelisk) in the aswan quarry. a little bit further up in the city of heliopolis (balbek), they were quarrying massive massive blocks. it speaks to me of a time when energy was rising and rising very rapidly.

well, like I have mentioned numerous times, when the energy rises like this, the "quantum physics" stuff becomes available on a macro scale -- or, in easier to understand terms, LOA has a nearly instantaneous effect, the more this enerty rises, and in the very energetic atmosphere of a nucleus of an atom (subatomic level), these effects are quite pronounced.

at the same time, at the 4 corners of the zodiac, which is essentially our relation to the centre of the galaxy (or something energetic). we can track our relation to it in reference to the "fixed" stars (or constellations). this is why astrotheology is so important to the ancients, because of these 4 corners. in the bible these are represented by the man (aquarius), lion (leo), ox (taurus), and eagle (scorpius).

these 4 corners correspond to the 4 cardinal point of a sine-wave: +1,+0,-0,-1. at these 4 points, something special happens, and I'll explain it a bit better in the future, but think of DNA when it folds: normally a value associated determines whether the signal continues forward, or branches to the left or the right, or makes a reversal and goes backwards. however, when the value is exactly zero, and this happens for an infinitessimally short period of time, the value can either be positive or negative. clearly for the signal to have that kind of timing where it could be in the superposition of positive or negative is something that only God (source) can possibly make happen. no human could orchestrate the exact moment that this happens with something big, accept for LOA.

the other option is at the peaks, and this has a slightly different effect because -1 is different than +1, but they are both the peaks. again this can create a branch to any of the other 4 directions, which that timing could only be attracted with LOA and I believe that when these moments occur, in an individial's DNA and on a global scale, these "time splits" which only LOA can control are happening. since everything is vibrating, and with most visible atoms passing through these 4 corners billions of times per second, and DNA happening I dunno -- thousands? -- plus, all orbits of everything. everything is cyclical, so you can imagine how many time splits are happening all of the time. the energy of "source" or God is so tremendous, it cannot really be described very well with words.

however, when a lot of energy accumulates into one of these slower frequency waves, like the time it takes a planet to travel around the sun, or a sun to travel around a galaxy, the energy that accumulates is so massive, when these four corners are reached (like the equinox or solstice herk on earth), then the energy is massive. I think this is one of the reasons why the ancients (or pagans) celebrated these four corners so much -- because the impossible can happen on them...

back to the story here...plato retells this exact moment when he recounts the event where the atlantians (saturn) came to invade and take over all of europe, however the ancient greeks/athenians (jupiter/zeus), defeated this atlantian invasion (saturn defeated zeus), all at about the same exact time that the solar system was passing through one of these four corners. velikovski suggests that when this happened (TODO: link to the unpublished book), saturn produced and output a tremendous amount of water, giving him his rings, symbolically, kronos/saturn wept at the defeat of these his people.

then, just as plato retells it, in a short period of time earthquakes atlantis sank into the ocean: "in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies."

#### the reversal

plato also recalls in criteus the change in the rising and setting of the sun @[youtube](https://youtu.be/B96pWvEwPBE?t=201), which makes me think of the earth how it is now. so, if these deluges seem to change the setting of the sun, meaning that north is south and south is north, essentially meaning that the crust becomes a slippery surface and can reorient itself so that it matches the new polarity (north/south), so that would (from a globe's perspective) look like antartica is now the north pole, and norway is now at the south pole (the earth would rotate in the same way it does now), meaning that from the perspective on the ground, nothing appears different, cept now the sun sets in the east and rises in the west. if that were the case, as plato tells us, and you were to look out at the constellation during springtime equinox, you would no longer see scorpio/ophiuchus rising with the sun, but instead the opposite side of the zodiac, taurus.

I believe this is why all of a sudden there was a dramatic change from pre-dynastic to the sudden worship of the bull. the pre-dyanastic civilisation got wiped out, and when the egyptians that survived (blonde/red hair and blue eyes), then these became the dynastic egyptians.

after the exodus from the 18th dynasty, moses declares the age of aries when he slays the golden ox. leading up to this, was alraedy the remnants of the deluge, as retold as the story of noah landing in the caucasian region (near turkey), which after some event the dead sea became salty and started the "aryan invasion"

it's really blurry, so there's no way to easily say one is one bloodline and the other is another. it's hard to put it all together. there's another thing which I don't understand which is the lion. there are, like in bavaria and paletine (and of course the "lion of judah") references to this lion as well. I don't get it all, but perhaps, because it's another one of the corners, it has something to do with something. additionally, for example, the sythians had an obsession with the gryphon, which is a cross between the lion and the eagle.

#### united states is the establishment of the eagle


I won't go into it all here, and robert does a much better job than me, so forgive me for not referencing it all... essentially, the frankists became the illuminati, which is mostly (but it's really hard to tell them all apart at times) the eagle (which are decendents from these), and these mostly rule the world through economics. the united states was founded by these "jews" (I put quotes because they could be sabatians) which were forced to convert to christantity and were exiled to the new world.
however, for example, the federal reserve was founded on an indian reserve, where they were tall fair skinned indians that practised child sacrifice (so serpent bloodline). @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ragF5M7Z01E)

however, it appears to me that the serpent are represented by what we now know as the nazi aryans, and are technologically far superior to everyone else and exist under the ice in antartica.

the eagle is mostly the major banking -- and while they don't have quite the same tecnological power as thes serpent, instead they rule the world economically, funding both sides of the different wars and conflicts that have been occurring.

#### the mixing of the eagle and serpent bloodlines

these two factions have been warring against each other for a long time now and have infiltrated each other's own power structures so much that it can be difficult to tell them apart.

however with the advent of "the network", these two factions have had to begin to combine into one... kinda. in reference to my own material, the ones pumped up about the genetic engineering stuff are likely the serpents. they seem to be interested in me for that reason. the eagles are the ones that control the world finance and media, which I'll sum up into the "bankers + mainstream media and hollywood" category. they seem interested in me for the media control aspect of things.

at this point, they both are so intertwined and reliant on each other because the tech guys are not good at making the illusions that mainstream media and hollywood are to cover up and essentially rewrite history.

#### age of aquarius corner

the idea is that what we experienced here isn't what happened on all timelines. like I mentioned, these corners can take a different branches, and so while I'm pretty sure I understand the polarity (+0/-0) inversion or reversal, I don't yet understand the other one. I'll update when I understand that one better, however, I suggest that an alternate earth exists which did not experience the reversal, and who's sun still rises in the west and didn't have a deluge either.

the reason why I think this is because these corners are hit, and the energy is divided, where each energy goes it's respective direction. so, what I mean is that, there were, under those highly energetic conditions, lots of people giving a lot of attention to unwanted, and so they literally attracted such a massive defeat that their negative emotion *attracted* a cataclysmic event (deluge), which is symbllically represented by saturn's sorrow.

for those that did not have their attention on so much unwanted, would not attract such a thing, and that earth would have continued on in quite energetic and beficial conditions right on into libra (and then into virgo). this would have had a dramatically different effect, as instead of it resulting in an aryan invasion, a matriarch would have been established.

#### venus in the mix

an anomaly in all of this is the planet venus. the dynastic egyptians in the age of taurus, and the nazis in this age are benefiting greatly from the technology left behind by the (symbolic and literal) mercury/thoth guy, however, in my estimation moses didn't like this power structure, and instead decided that venus needed to be invoked... this culminated in the age of picsis with the appearance of jesus, which I believe was essentially the personification of venus. this again raised energy levels and resulted in the flavian christianity and the destruction of the temple, which after a long history of conflict brings us to today.

if there is going to be another reversal, I think it's going to be the exact opposite as the previous one. so while the ones with their attention on unwanted experienced the reversal, this time, I believe the ones with their attention on unwanted will *not* experince the reversal.

they will continue on right into capricorn which is saturn's planet, and will experience the "pan/baphomet/hermaphrodite" (depending on your perspective) invasion experience.

for those with their attention on wanted, we will likely experience the reversal and once again the sun will rise in the west, and the planet's energy will rise. I think this is symbolic of the "lion of judah" symbolism. the last few days, it has appeared to me like the main split will happen with the genetic engineers and tech (physicality/reality oriented) guys going toward capricorn (no reversal), and the emotionally oriented ones going to the reversal.

I don't believe this reversal will result in cataclysm though. I think that even though there will be major changes on earth, as soon as the nosebook influence lifts, we'll all experience the ability to fly and other such things. I think it'll become such an energetic place that things will become kinda dream-state like.

if this were to happen to the people that are focused upon unwanted, it would be cataclysmic, however, because this corner seems to change "direction" instead of "polarity", the change is a *gradual* (cause this is the peak of the sine wave, instead of the fastest moving -0 -> +0 change in the middle) shift in direction toward wanted.

---

quick note: the way it works out is the following: for the reversal on taurus/scorpio, the polarity changes, like from -0 -> +0, meaning that all of a sudden north is south and south is north. however, for the aquarius/leo reversal, it's a change in direction, so what we should experience is a gradual arrival toward some sort of peak, and then a gradual increase from the bottom of the lowest energy state. I don't have the info on this, but it could have something to do with the speed of light (if that's connected to the rotation speed or something -- dunno). the increase wouldn't be much though and unnoticeable to us, because if peak is in 18 years, let's say that means we're 99.999% of peak, so it would be only a 0.0001% change max which is very small. symbolically however, this is clearly the peak of unwanted, and then then the reversal in direction toward wanted again.

however, if the earth's rotation did reverse, it would produce the same effect as previously stated: the sun would rise in the west and set in the east, and on the equinox, instead of aquarius appearing behind the sunrise, it would be leo. if the earth's rotation were to be slowing, someone must be artificially rotating the earth. I dunno I don't really see it though. I don't have enough info to comment further. I just don't know.

either way, this gradual reversal in direction toward wanted seems to check out with what I was seeing when I was stoned, that on the hollywood timeline things would go to where the "bad guys" somehow manage to find redemption and become the "good guys". I could see that it was not instant, and it would take a bit to get there.

#### incomplete, but I think I figured out the reversal

if the concept is that aquarius is one peak and the leo is the other. and say we're approaching +1 right now (just for numbers), that would make leo -1. what that reversal would mean is a transformation into a higher energy state, starting off in it's lowest energy form (-1). so what would happen, is instead of getting to 1, we would get to -1 which is like the farthest away distance from the next peak.

the idea is that things that are vibrating, are always changing back to the same thing. a dinosaur doesn't spontaneously become something else (like a bird) at random. instaed, if the conditions change to such a point, like let's say an increase in gravity, that the dinosaur finds itself unable to move under the weight, the desire to be able to move would cause a transformation, and it would take upon a new form -- like something with wings like a bird or something. meaning, that things do not spontaneously change, they are only happening as an evolution of desire.

for example, I may have wanted something, like to be able to ... whatever, but then nosebook makes it literally impossible for that to become a reality for me, so that desire evolves into something better, considering the new environmental conditions.

I think something is happening to this planet where its inhabitants (like me) are desiring to enjoy flight, and to make the air more conductive and to make the whole world much more dream like, where basically everyone has superhero-like powers and stuff. it'll be a totally different experience. obviously nosebook does not want this, so they'll continue on without the reversal, however, I think for us who desire such a thing, the earth will undergo some rapid transformations which would be pretty upsetting to a lot of the nosebook types, if it were to occur. because these polarity changes seem to happen based on LOA, this is just sort of like the separator based on desire. those who want the decline in energy will go their way, and those on board with a "new earth" (I sound like revelation words) will go that way.

when that change in polarity happens, the planet will jump up to a higher energy state, allowing that sort of thing. those who continue on toward capricorn will instead experience a gradual (not sudden like the polarity change) decline in the energy state of the planet as they come down from their energetic peak.

in short, I do not expect a cataclysm at all but instead it feels like the shift when I think of what it was like for me the first time I experienced 4d. it totally took me by surprise and it was as if everything jolted open for me. the polarity change will likely not have any real major difficulties, other than everyone will suddenly feel enlightened and see very clearly. I doubt much destruction will happen unless you attract it. LOA will become act very quickly and people's thoughts will become manifest more rapidly, people flying, creating things with their mind, etc. I also think that this has something to do with the "story mode" as well, and it wouldn't even surprise me if we find ourselves in a disjointed state from our bodies (a source-like perspective), where you are no longer your physical body anymore, and different things and characters can be created and interacted with at will without any effort other than to think about it. I think that we'll all be pretty separated from each other in terms of time too, each experiencing their own reality so like if someone is making one thing with some thoughts, if those thoughts aren't harmonic with mine, we won't experience the same reality.

it's hard to really tell all of this. I have no idea what physical reality could be like. however, it seems to me like it's important to have the hollywood druids on board here because this planet will all be all about emotions and stuff, so we'll need good conflicts and stories. everything should be pretty epic, and you'll navigate your timelines and your stories on an emotional level, and it'll be good to have an environment full of all sorts of different "props" and "sets" to play with things.

I also don't see this part very well, because I cannot envision a change in polarity very well. I've never experienced one, but I think things are all pretty much going to be about the same -- just you won't need to be tied anymore to your physical body anymore...

actually, that may be the exact reason why the hollywood idea is so important, because think about it: the stronger the emotion you feel, the more "real" reality is, and therefore the more you're stuck in your body. likely, they'll want to make sure people are controlled and *not* in that source-like perspective, meaning exeriencing drama and getting stuck in that cycle of false perception, because obviously, if you're there, you're not feeling better and better, and so therefore not getting your source-like perspective. duh, because if you had a source-like perspective you could create whatever you wanted with your mind, and be incharge of your own timelines, and that means you wouldn't need their economic system and their materialistic reality.

likely, they'll want to, like they do with me, withhold the ability for me to gain a broader perspective, locking me into my two eyes (or maybe into a crippled version of 5d), ensuring that I never get access to 6d perspective, so I can never make my own timelines, and they control my passage through time with their dumb movie script bs.

something like that probably, because that means that no matter what situation (or scene) I find myself in, I need to learn how to feel the way I want to. as long as I believe their illusion, they retain control over me and my passage through time.

I guess that's my speculation. we'll have to see. if that is the case, I think, like I mentioned in a previous entry, we'll likely want to hit this timeline with all sorts of bad ideas, so that we gain a lot of contrast. I have a feeling that there will be certain ones (likely I'll be one of them) that have figured out the power of emotions, and will make these trips through their different scenes... kinda like superheroes or something...

it's really hard to tell this far out in a world which I cannot imagine, but am just trying to anticipate based on some transformations on some concepts I understand. none of this probably is close, and all of it is *certainly* outdated by now. on to the next evolution :)


### 2020-09-22 08:55 - globalwin continued

yesterday, I was really struggling to understand the concept I was trying to get to. my reception was pretty bad, but last night up on the field, I figured it out. interestingly, it happened around the time of the sunrise, and upon making the realisation, a number of vision upgrades followed.

I realised there is a reason why intuitively I keep shooting for the "worst" manifestation, and in order to explain it, imagine a row of bathtubs:

```
     waves
  <-> <-> <->
++---+---+---+
|| 1 | 2 | 3 |
++---+---+---+

<- unwanted
     wanted ->
```

think of these like "double layers" and imagine that the first tub starts to fill with water and it's water is rocking back and forward from left to right. for illustration purposes to make things more simple, there is a wall on the left side there. so, as that tub starts to fill with water or the wave going left to right, eventally at some moment the water will surpass the height of the wall between the first and second tubs, and water will begin to spill over.

if we think of water being more on on the left side of tub as unwanted, and the right side is wanted, then you can see that when the spillover happens, for the first tub, things are peak wanted, and in the second tub, things are peak unwanted.

imagine that the first tub keeps filling at the same rate and oscillations continue at the same frequency too, so you would see that every time the first tub is at max unwanted, the second tub is at max wanted. as that tub continues to fill further, it'll eventually spill over into the third tub, making the following pattern:

| tub 1 | tub 2 | tub 3 | tub 4 | tub 5 |
| unwanted | wanted | unwanted | | wanted | unwanted |
| <-- | --> | <-- | --> | <-- |
| wanted | unwanted | wanted | | unwanted | wanted |
| --> | <-- | --> | <-- | --> |

and so you can see that the wave tips always touch, so for example any tub is always opposite the other two on either side of it. this is the best way I can describe "double layers" or counter rotating fields, like the trade winds (east to west) and the atmospheric winds (which go west to east). to us they appear to have counter rotating fields, but their density waves between these concentric spheres can be seen like the waves in those tubs. each time a new layer is added, it's because the tub has filled enough to overflowing and beginh to spill out into the next spherical "shell"[^1]. you could understand this atmospheric better if you changed unwanted to "low pressure" and wanted to "high pressure"

---

ok, so going back to the reversals thing. because everyone involved when these corner hits, you get what you attract, which is why I think those who were focused on unwanted had a cataclysm on the taurus/scorpio one because that was crossing the zero position. this time, we're approaching the peak, so everyting that's higher than the rim of the tub will spill over into the next tub. the next tub is always a higher more energetic energy state. LOA kind of like divides these based on what people are attracting, so that from tub 1's perspective they'll lose some water weight and head back into the direction of unwanted again.

however, from tub 2's perspevtive, the one with the overflow, when the overflow happens, they are in maximal amounts of unwanted, and will then begin to head rapidly toward wanted as the water slides down the tub to the other side.

---

what that means is that when the reversal happens, we'll be at the maximum amount of "unwanted" (for that energy state) when it happens, which is just what I saw where the movie trope of the bad guy making a turn around into a good guy. so while at the moment, the globalist agenda is advancing at full speed, from those in control, this is where the most amount of "wanted" is happening for them. the ones that don't really perceive this globalist agenda as wanted, are sorta stuck because giving their attention to this unwanted is attracting it full speed, and so they'll head gradually in the direction of unwanted after the bathtub overflows. however, the rest of us, giving our attention to unwanted are on the peak most portion of the wanted, and will spill over:

```
    *  <- those focused toward max wanted spill over
   .||
   .||
  . ||
.   ||
<-- unwanted
```

you can see that all those who's focus isn't significantly on wanted will reverse directions at the peak of the wave and begin to go back toward uwanted. keep in mind that these waves between wanted and unwanted happen approx every ~6500 years, so their changes are not drastic and immediate. also, there is another factor which I don't know how to calculate, but similarly to how the longest day of the year is june 21, but the hottest days don't come until some time later in august, is because current trails voltage[^2], so while the spillover happens at the moment of the peak, like june 21, the heat (or in this case "wanted" current) won't actaully flow at its peak until some years ~2k years later (like ~2 months after june 21).

so, capricorn will be a period of quite a bit of "wanted" for them. for us however, in this new much higher energy state, what was previously thought of as wanted (the globalist agenda) won't be looking so great anymore, and from our new point of perception from the new power level, it'll look like maximum amount of unwanted. from there, the water will slide back down in the direction of wanted, and similarly for us, we'll experience the maximum decrease in unwanted and flow toward "wanted" probably around the time (~2k years later) of cancer.

---

in summary, it appears that if you want to go up a power level, be prepared to (from your new power level standpoint), come to realise that the manifestation is going to appear as "maximum unwanted" and then after going through a rough patch where it was maximum amount of unwanted, but don't worry because ~2k years later it'll be again maximum current flow in the direction of wanted, so a kind of "golden age" after the rough patch with only[^3] improvements from there.

so it seems that in order to constantly be seeing improvements and to continually see new power levels, one must perceive contrast as your friend, and not to be fearful of the "worst" manifestation in a new power level, because in comparison to the old power level it's not that bad, and at the same time you know it's only going to get better from there.

it seems to be a sort of impossible jump to go to a new power level and already experience the maximum wanted. when I say power level, I mean how you you feel, emotionally (your next logical state).

however, if you want the manifestation to be the maximum amount of wanted, without changing your power level, be prepared to, after a "golden age" of wanted catching up with you, your environment is going to grdadually head in the opposite direction.

it's not a surprise of the realisation of this, because this is what most people believe in. they don't see continual improvements, no matter the circumstances -- instead, they have a big payoff, and things feel really great for a bit after they win the lottery or whatever, but then things sort of get worse from there as things go back to "normal"

[1]: these shells are created radially outward probably from a "standing wave"

[2]: in an inductor, and it seems like these planetary bodies behave like inductors in orbit, but oach as a multilayered concentric spherical capacitor.

[3]: as always, there are ups and downs, but I mean in the bigger picture longer timescales, things are improving considerably until once again the next barrier is met and spilled over.


### 2020-09-23 16:31 - lady and the unicorn tapestries

[lady and the unicorn tapestries](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/artboards/theladyandtheunicorn/the-tapestries/)

these tapestries caught my attention in one of robert's videos about the unicorn: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLO_Dt4cevU), and "According to the myth of the hunt of the unicorn, the fierce and swift unicorn could only be captured if tamed by a virgin."

ok, so these tapestries really caught my eye because opposite the unicorn is a lion. robert explains that the unicorn is "in an astrological context, represents christ" cause it gets reborn every wintertime in the northern sky. I never really noticed this constellation because it was always labeled "pegasus" or something and I didn't know what that was. it's interesting that behind it, is canis (dogs) constellations, which correspond to the hunt, and possibly more[^1].

ok, so, another thing that one might notice about jesus is him using a lot of aquatic symbolism and other weird things like, announcing the age of aquarius when he said, “A man will meet you carrying an earthen pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in” (Luke 22:10). (in ancient times, aquarius was called the “water-bearer”). I just found [an interesting article](https://reverenddrred.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/jesus-and-the-age-of-aquarius/) where the reverend talks about the age of aquarius:

```
Luke 22:9-11 (KJV)
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

Let’s break it down:
the city = new age
man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water = symbol of Aquarius
house where he entereth in = Age of Aquarius
guestchamber = Serpentarius

So we now have:
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city (new age), there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water (symbol of Aquarius); follow him into the house where he entereth in (Age of Aquarius).
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house [Age of Aquarius], The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber (Serpentarius), where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

Or with just the hidden meaning:

And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the [new age], there shall meet you [Aquarius]; follow him into the [Age of Aquarius].
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the [Age of Aquarius] The Master saith unto thee, Where is the [Serpentarius], where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

This statement is mirrored in Mark. Lets have a look:
Mark 14:12-14 (KJV)
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

The breakdown:
when they killed the passover = ending the ‘Age of Aries’, entering into the ‘Age of Pisces’ during the cusp between the ages. The lamb is a symbol of Aries.
he sendeth forth two of his disciples = The two witnesses of the last days *(see Rev. 11:3 below)
the city = new age
meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water = symbol of Aquarius
wheresoever he shall go in = Age of Aquarius
guestchamber = Serpentarius

So now we have:
Mark 14:12-14 (KJV)
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they [left the Age of Aries, entering the Age of Pisces], his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest [leave the Age of Aries]?
And he sendeth forth [the two witnesses], and saith unto them, Go ye into the [new age], and there shall meet you [Aquarius]: follow him.
And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the [Age of Aquarius], The Master saith, Where is the [Serpentarius], where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

Some may question, if this is indeed true, why hide it from us and why hide the 13th zodiac? Satan, as called by many, needs our consent to have control over us in any way. Rules are the Truth must be provided. In every aspect of life we see hints of the Truth. It is up to us to decipher it. Much of what the ‘Old Testament’ calls evil (astrology for example) are tools which may be used to decipher the world around us. The evil knows their time is short, and perverted many teachings while exposing the Truth hidden behind symbolism. Jesus, in the ‘New Testament’, tells us to watch for signs in the heavens (astrology).
```

the important thing to note is that when the lamb (aries) was slain, we entered into picsis. also, when the reverend talks about ophiuchus, I have to ahere to my interpretation of the scorpio sign being two real signs of the serpent and the eagle, which capture the conflict between cronos and zeus (saturn and jupiter), or the eagle and serpent bloodlines' (athenians and atlantians) conflict which was the precursor to the deluge.

the bit about 13 signs really being 12, I think was just a fortuitis coincidence which made it easy for them to hide that serpent/eagle symbolism into one sign which sounds nothing like a reptile, serpent, eagle, or phoenix. the 12 is used to show that zeus won the sky battle (jupiter has a 12 year orbit) and 3 is a number of cycles and 4 is the number of earth or 4 cardinal corners of those cycles, so 3*4=12 (also see my work on orientation).

furthermore, I don't belive we're going to ophiuchus, but to leo -- which with, a reveral of polarity in the magnetic field of earth would, as illistrated in the previous entry, put the planet exactly upside down and cause the lion (which is opposite aquarius) to appear on the equinox, instead of aquarius. I think this is the true meaning as to how we jumped instantly from serpent/eagle symbolism to bull symbolism, and how the lion is directly correlated to this aquarian age.

---

on to the tapestry. putting those different pieces into the puzzle, I believe I have made a strong enough case that the unicorn represents the aquarian age and is opposite the lion. one will immediately notice the downward facing crecent on the coat of arms logo which I'm pretty certain is the symbol for lucifer/venus[^3]. one will also notice that sometimes the flag is square and sometimes it's a curve thing. there are also 4 trees which show up, and I've listed them here with their druid name (if you want to look that up)

- pine/fir (ailm)
  - evergreen
  - pineal gland (perception)
  - coming sun after winter
- holly (tinne)
  - evergreen twin of oak: controller of dark half of year
  - eternal life
  - fertility
- apple (quert)
  - not evergreen
  - purity/love/creativity
  - associated with the garden of eden version of "gnosis" (sex)
- oak (dair)
  - evergreen twin of holly: controller of light half of year
  - strength / wisdom
  - beautiful dense wood and very resilient

next, it appears that the trees are laid out where one is above, or dominant the other on both left and the right. I believe that the left side represents abstract reasoning and the right represents logical reasoning. there are 5 scenes representing the physical senses, and one non-physical sense which is sort of like the conclusion, labeled[^4], "my only desire".

#### see
#### hear
#### smell
#### taste
#### touch
#### desire

[1]: I find it weird that in a previous entry I linked the canis major/minor constellation to the origins of the caananite (aryan+indigenous canis major/sirian seed) people[^2]. anyway, in the hunt the unicorn, which is represted christ in both pagan and christian traditions, is hunted down by a bunch of dogs (canis) and has other symbolism that I don't see very well yet, but I'll come to that ones soon, probably...

[2]: I know that all aryans came out of the original seed (serpent and then eagle), which then mixed with the local indigenous peoples, which I think were also seeded (the sirian guide says they were all engineered specifically) from other major sky peoples. I'll get to this more in the future when I explain my theories on how the win-win claims I'm talking about ties into slavery and the sub saharan african peoples -- which I believe have much hidden talent and beauty, that the white guys *don't* have, and it's waiting to be unlocked in better conditions -- meaning, I think their bodies are designed to run at even higher frequencies than white people's are.

[3]:  it could also be when the moon eclipses the sun, however, in the morning, if venus weren't so bright itself, the crecent shape there would be how venus would look if illuminated by the sun before the sunrise. it just occurred to me I don't know what the crecent facing up (not down), would be...

[4]: on the tent, which is like the tabernacle or your heart

### 2020-09-24 15:52 - language creates illusion & your emotion creates reality

yesterday, I was watching a few of santos bonacci's old presentations on "all is atum" -- and he takes a language based approach to trying to figure out the nature of reality, linking a lot of words that sound similar or when you put them together it makes a new concept.

I'll be honest, I was very intrigued because it seems to work 80-90% of the time, yet there are some obvious flaws in that technique, because words don't really mean a lot to a lot of people. he totally had me when he explained the language significance of "pinoccio" or pine-occio: pine as in pineal, and occio as in occular, and so pinoccio is telling lies and his nose is growing, so to develop your pineal eye, you have to stop lying. I find that *story* very intriguing becsuse I know this to be true.

I have stated in numerous places that the key to developing perception and improved eyesight is to essentially stop lying, so that the speed your your brain operates between thought and action or observation and thought has less "bucle" (cycles) that it needs to go through to see "reality". I have also said that you are essentially looking at a screen and that you are not truly seeing until you are actually inside of your body and are capable of perceiving the space between you and what you're looking at. because there also appears to be space even when looking at the screen (just like 3d games look 3d, not 2d), it's very difficult to explain what I mean until you've seen it for yourself. in that moment, you are finally inside of your body and actually seeing through your eyes, instead of the image on the screen.

the next thing he was talking about is the two torroidal fields, which manifest the polarities as red and blue. red and blue is essentially the limit of normal vision -- however, I believe that UV is perceivable as well, this probably isn't something that a normal person living in the illusion of reality (language) is seeing; they're seeing something in the wavelengths between red and blue. anyway, to illustrate this, he shows how in language, "adam" or "man" is linked to "rojo" or "tor-us" which red-most part of the manifestation is rotation, and is symbolic of man.

interesting because the phonecians painted their white skin red, just as the minoans, and the egyptians pharaohs. since basically all alphabet languages stem from the same proto-indo-european (aryan) language, this seems to make sense.

what's crazy to me is this thing that he describes as syncronicity(?) where there is this crazy thing where language seems to adapt to the illusion, and the illusion seems to adapt to the language. they seem intertwined.

he then had me again when he was talking abou s-tor-y, which is a spinning red torus created by man -- his-tory -- his red spinning reality illusion.

this got me thinking a lot about stories because yesterday I watched another of robert's videos (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flJQxNqUWS0)) on fairy tales and fables in the aryan languages being stable across languages and for thousands of years -- and, for perhaps even longer than that, because before there was writing, these were likely passed down orally. it seems as if the aryans either arrived here or some influence in their previous atlantian culture built up these stories which then proceeded to influence their reality for quite some time (until disney and the hollywood druids).

one of the examples of this is the story calld "the smith and the devil" @[youtube](https://youtu.be/flJQxNqUWS0?t=244), which caught my attention because of the blacksmith part, so I looked it up online to see what others there were and a site built around cataloguing tv tropes had some variations that I found interesting:

```
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DealWithTheDevil/FolkloreAndFairyTales

One story has a wily blacksmith who sells his soul to the Devil in return for the magical power to stick anything to anything (hey, that's useful for a smith). When the Devil sends first his son and then his daughter to collect on the bargain, the smith uses his magic powers to not only stop them but embarrass them until they go away. Then the Devil declares he has to do the job himself, and fails. The smith tells him that if he can just live out is natural life the Devil is jolly welcome to take his soul when that day comes... but when that day comes, the Devil gets so horrified at the idea of having the smith down there, that he screams that the deal is off and tells the smith to get himself packing to Heaven. Which let him in. Apparently, trolling the devil counters engaging in black magic deals.

In "Bearskin", a soldier makes a Deal With The Devil, who will give him an ever-filled purse, but he must not pray, wash, cut his hair or nails, or change from a bearskin for seven years. He goes about distributing money to the poor, asking them to pray for him. One man he rescues from financial distress promises that he may marry one of his daughters. Only the youngest is willing. He succeeds in fulfilling the devil's terms and cleans up nicely, and the older sisters, reduced to envy, commit suicide. The Devil, pleased at his dumb luck, informs the soldier that he got two souls, not one.
```

huh! this really got me thinking about how you can encode different ideas or concepts -- call them even desires encoded into story form. the blacksmith story is a really weird one, because if you're going to make a deal with the devil, why on earth would to do it to have the superpower of sticking two things together. other than it giving you the ability to reneg on your deal, I mean I guess that's pretty useful to a blacksmith, so this guy must have been really interested in his work. I say that because if it were someone interested in power, they would have asked for the ability to light anything on fire or to crush anything -- or something like that, then used that skill to light the devil on fire or crish him.

the ability to stick anything together is such a weird superpower to desire that one must wonder if this story has some form of real-life inspiration to it. there are interesting things like the the devil first sending his son (to get the job done), and then his daughter (asuming to appeal to the blacksmith's lust), yet the interactions were so embarrassing for the devil, he decides that his soul isn't worth it, and doesn't want him in hell, meaning that the blacksmith walks away unaffected by the devil and with a very useful skill for his profession. it has the undertone that the devil (who is symbolic ofthe most powerful malevelent force) is not to be feared and can always be defeated when one focuses on their work.

however, if one desired money, then it becomes difficult to defeat the devil with just money. additionally, if you had unlimited money, because money is an illusion, in the second story, the tradeoff for unlimited money is to not be able to wash, cut his hair or nails, pray, or change out of a hideous outfit -- these are all things were (especially at that time) all illusions of piety. so, with the inability to party with such a hideous appearance, he was then reduced to helping the poor for 7 years. the twist is that he is offered a daughter's hand in marriage (only given to pius, good appearing people), and of the tree daughters, two judge him by his appearance and the third on his actions of charity. so, when he cleans up and turns back into a handsome gentleman at the end (I assume still with the unending purse), the daughters who judged him by his appearance killed theirselves after how sad their bad judgement made them feel.

this second story is is all about appearance. the man must give up the ablity to have a good appearance for 7 years, and instead focus on charitable activities instead of self-service, because at the end he would find a wife that would see him for his actions instead of his appearance. as great as that story sounds, the whole story kinda has the undertone that action is better than appearance, when, if one cannot pray, which is an action giving the appearance of piety, this story is only there to reinforece that a man should be judged not by his appearance but by his actions, which means that if you do the right actions, then you will be judged to be a better person than the other.

see how the moral of the stories reinforces limiting ideas by defeating old ideas? there is a lot of value in this idea, because it allows for some pretty interesting narratives to appear, and for a slow progession toward realising one's own power. I dunno. interesting.

---

anyway, to close up here, I really am starting to come to realise that words (and by extension stories) create an illusion reality, which isn't true. it's actually an impossibility. the reason why I dislike so many stories and hollywood movies, is because their version of reality is so far from what is real, I find it very difficilt to believe some of those narratives, however, at the same time, as people begin to believe in the these bizarre narratives as reality, they *do* create a real reality by their attention to them.

as an example, the prophets conjured this story of this "messiah" that would appear for the jews and would "save" them from their difficult spot, however, that messiah didn't show up at all how they wanted it to go, and appeared nothing like the narrative at all. the reason why is because if you try to fit those components into a LOA based reality, they don't work, because of where the focus is (usually on the problem). there is never a magical saviour that will come and bail you out of your jam, so one must learn to create with the power of their focus. because this is so, the "saviour" never actually does the saving, but shows you how to save yourself -- and stories are a great way of conjuring this magical saviour, in real-life reality, to not at all appear how you wanted him/her to (perhaps even the opposite), forcing you to find your own way to your salvation.

or, as I like to put it, focusing just on all of the improvements you observe, and letting the other unexpected surprises show up, without trying to conjure them directly from a narrative.

### 2020-09-22 -> 2020-09-25 08:46 - protector of thieves

I've been thinking about this for a few days now, even though it has felt like a week or so. I got some reactions to the stuff I wrote about the triads and stuff. additionally, I would have to guess that it was the day that I marked up there, or the day before -- however, it was around the equinox, so it was during a more energetic time -- and I was feeling (and responding) to different reactions around the idea where I was talking about how if I'm connected, then it doesn't really matter as much to me if the girl is a virgin or not.

the reactions also gave me the impression that for some of the girls, especially some of the younger ones, the mom was the one carrying the majority of the desire, and therefore, by extension, desired that her daughter be apart of this. I really have no problem at all with that.

however, I was thinking about some of the "rammifications" to that idea, which is the main reason why I have held off on opining on this further. the ones I have identified are the following:

- the girl may feel like her mom is encroaching on her territory or trying to capitalise on her desire
  -> obviously, this is a bogus way of thinking, invoking territory dawg, and perhaps (in)security dawg as well. clearly, if something is feeling bad for anyone, this is focus on unwanted, and this faulty form of perception will either slow (with contradictory feelings) their manifestation down, or bring them the manifestation that would would otherwise appear more on the unwanted category of things. additionally, it isn't the same way her source perceives things.
  -> also, trying to adjust to other people's bad feeings, feelings of offense or insecurity (or whatever) isn't what I'm about. if I try and make everyone happy, it won't work because lots of people have lots of different things going on.
- it removes the part of the original (gnomitos) concept which was that we would, just have the virgin girls and that only create children that were having the girls and my energy in the equation, allowing for a more "pure" set of children
  -> this concept may be ahead of its time, and I had this idea last night where I was thinking that perhaps the concept where we go continually toward not having the manifestation, letting the momentary (now) progression be the manifestation (as mentioned in the paradox entry TODO: reference).
    -> instead, what I suggested may actually happen is, we'll go toward the lion, and do many iterations and expand a bit there, but this is kinda the beginning of the female (matriarchical) empowerment, and it's likely that, just as I imagine on the other side in the archer, they'll improve upon conditions in effort to try and make a more targetted version of the ideal man. likewise, in the crab and then later with the twins what I suggested may happen is, continuing to optimise on conditions (because we're going to be finally coming to the maximum rate of improvement from the hollywood spin cycle here, too), so I would guess that we'll optimise prehaps in genetics, but also in the situation as well, meaning that in the crab we'll probably want to do the different ideas presented in the gnomitos project, where we try to make more and more energetically optimised offspring. additionally, you could imagine that if there were like different "villages" where people went and visited them (were born into each other's cultures)[^1], this would make for a whole lot of really interesting and diverse content for the hollywood idea, and also allows for controlled rate of diversification based on people's desire to experience new things.
    -> I have suggested that it's best to go the more contrast route, knowing that everything will be an improvement from there.
- I don't know how to say this without offending someone, so I'll just blurt it out here and try to fix it later. it felt like there was a feeling like the reason why some of the men enjoyed the idea that their daughters would joining me is becasuse their mom was a real pain (maybe even total basketcase) of sorts, and the idea of being around me would lessen the possibility that their daughter would turn out like their mother. so then, when I tune into and even contemplate the idea of then letting her mom's desire to manifest as well, feels like I would be rewarding the mother's undesirable or hurtful behaviour.
  -> well, this falls into the category of justice dawg, and perhaps injury dawg as well depending on how much he identifies with that pain to get attention... but, other than that, I do recognise that it could produce a less than ideal manifestation as well, which is why I'm not super duper ready (and don't really want) to say yes right away. so, like always, when confronted with these difficulties, I'm just going to let the desire build and to evolve into something more wanted for all. I don't know yet. we'll just have to see.
  -> I have constantly been fascinated with the story that abraham tells of a man that has an ex-wife which takes a portion of his income for child support or something, and every time he gets a raise, she comes to take more. he seems distraught with the idea that she's "taking" his money from him, however abraham doesn't see it this way at all. they instead suggest to him that his ex-wife's desire (or parasitic behaviour) is actually part of the the desire which is giving him the raises, and they instead wish he had 10 ex-wives, because the many ex-wives desire combined would be stronger than his on his own, and would create a much bigger vortex.
    -> I don't mean to be the protector of thives here, but what I have learned and experienced with my own two eyes with my interaction with nosebook, is that this is absolutely true. I am certain that I would not be progressing as rapidly as I am right now if it weren't for their theft. sure they don't pay me for my work, but I would be star-watching just like I am now even if they weren't stealing from me, and in the end, it's sort of a win-win because they're propelling me forward at a much more rapid pace.
    -> in the same way, these women have obviously had different difficulties (whatever they may have been) which got them to the point where they're at now, which means that their desire is strong, and even though they may not have had their attention on what they wanted, their desire is still strong. sorry for another potentailly offensive statement here: some of them may believe that they're (for whatever reason) unable to turn their attention toward and manifest what they want, they can and do have un-contradicted belief that their offspring would be capable of manifesting the boy/man that they would desire -- or maybe even the better version of theirself that they wish they could have been. or, maybe similar to nosebook, they believe that someone like me could manifest the physical conditions that they don't theirselves feel capable of manifesting. if that's the case, it doesn't really matter, because everyone is where they is, and it sounds to me like the path of least resistance, for them to believe in the manifestation of what they want, no?
      -> this is actually the reason why I believe the next era will instead attempt to optimise conditions. hear me when I say this, but after a bit of this sort of environment, there will be a lot less difficult men causing problems, meaning there will be less stronger desire, and so to make more energitic offspring, one will need to either make more difficult men/women again to create more desire for improvements on those rascals or to optimise what's already working.
        -> clearly, it's not optimal to make a bunch of deadbeats just to make more desire, which is also why I think it'll be a natural transition for us to create (on purpose) difficult and primitive worlds so that we can incarnate into those to give birth to more desire.
        -> it also occurs to me that this is likely to be exactly what earth is to the pleadians, sirians, etc. which is our "seed". they are able to give birth to their own desire from watching and interacting with their "truman show" (cept it's not one guy; it's a whole race they're watching from different chraracters' standpoints). this may sound terrible, but as we begin to become less-resistant, these circumstanves which we choose to incarnate into will appear to the creators like we're just actors or characters in a story. however, the illusion of being inside of your body feels so real, you would swear it was "reality" -- even though, what it really is, is a story you wrote and you incarnated into it without any memory of who you really are, so that it's the most engaging and and believable experience.

I want to mention that I'm using the names the archer, lion, and crab not necessarily to represent the eras in the great year, even though it may be that... we all create our own reality, and as long as we're following the format of most contrasting manifestation, then it'll work out fine. I don't know if it is literally that time, because there's a lot of evidence to suggest that we've completely left the limitations imposed by the great year[^2]. I am meerly referencing them as a way of talking about the different sections of the sine wave, even though the archetypical concepts believed in and transmitted over time as to the influence of that part of the sine wave seem to be somewhat embedded in our psyche a bit and will perhaps serve as a foundation for some story ideas. at any rate, I'm interested in improving on how I transmit these different parts of the sine wave and the orientation in respcet to them, because I need a better way of describing the part of the curve in relation to the orientation in these concepts.

---

I had a few other concerns I was picking up on, but I honestly cannot remember them now. I'll update when/if I think of them. however, I think this covers it pretty well for now, so I'll leave it here.

[1]: I'm missing a concept here that I haven't really known how to explain, which is the difference between man-beat and culture-beat which the culture-beat represents the female side and it's all about continually telling a story through transitions -- whereas, the man-beat is all about constancia and attaining focus. this ties right into the "mana-grinder" idea and is basically the same concept but perceived from the opposite direction. time can both be seen as a series of cycles (mana-grinder,man-beat), and also as a never ending series of transitions (culture-beat,story-time). culture-beat is also intimately tied to language. I'll revisit this idea more.

[2]: yes, I am suggesting that while they will likely continue on, on their path toward the goat, our planet will go through a lot of different changes and that while they're on track for the earth *not* having a catastrophe, we're on track for the galaxy idea, where first our planet swaps its directions, and I don't know if it'll happen before the split or not, but probably we'll need to do tesla's idea of turning the earth into a second sun, and we'll all become planetary dieties as energy begins to collect around the sun. the hollywood spin cycle will increase our energy so much that the solution will eventually to make for the people a similar aparatus like I will soon need where the machine is the receptor of the non-physical energy and the bod(y/ies) that my consciousness inhabits, are just resonant cavities of that bigger thing which could eventually grow to be any size. once we're planets, we'll begin to see the physical manifestation (in planetary/solar form) of each other's energy, the hollywood project will obviously expands into constructing indigenous species, exploring and inhabiting foreign solar systems, and just like movie stars, we'll cameo in each other's worlds, interacting and incarnating in/on these worlds.

### 2020-09-25 23:49 - the great year

a few people have claimed (most notably joeseph brown, which I have mentioned a few times from borderlands "fame") that our star is in a binary orbit with sirius (a or b, I can't remember), and the idea has intrigued me, because I thought it would be quite a cool thing because more than 50% of the stuff I have gotten has had some inspiration in the "sirian guide to human development" which I encountered a while ago while living in berlin along with some other strange encounters with time travellers and stuff. not coincidentally, all of that data was on a computer that was on a computer that was stollen in berlin, and the thieves had this strange aura which I remember strongly, which also coincidentally had a similar aura to the thieves which took raquel's phone. a lot of weird stuff happened around that time (2011-2012).

anyway, I liked the concept when I heard it, but I never really wanted to look it up, just assuming it was more than likely to be true. howerever, I wanted to look it up, and it may come in response to the things I've been referring to in the great year.

when I first understood the "great cycle" I didn't learn of it like a binary system thing, even though after watcrhing these videos today, am pretty convinced that we are in a binary system with sirius. however, my understanding was not based on a binary ecliptical orbit with another star, but in relation to something else, which has a sinusoidal pattern to it with the reversals occurring on the peaks and the crossing of the zero point.

first, I'm pretty sure that the reason why the "autumnal equinox" was used to determine the age in past times, was either that, or they always used the spring equinox and the earth was just upside down at that time. that would certainly explain the discontenuity of the bull symbolism happening only thousands of years ago, not tens of thousands of years ago.

one of the things that I couldn't explain with my sinusoidal method was how the peaks could be so extreme, so it wouldn't surprise me if there is an additional cycle coming into play here, because it seems that in addition to the different ages, there is also an additional theme that states that roughly every ~2000 years, something big happens, which can be explained by the change of the ages, which is probably why they're divided into 12 (even though there are 13) of exactly 30°, but that doesn't explain why something big happens with each change of age. this to me is evidence of at least one more cycle.

we know of another cycle within our solar system which has peaks and different polarity, and that's the solar wind. I don't have enough information on this to make a good guess here, but it seems likely that if the galactic core is periodic in nature, the galactic wind could have tremendous effects on things and this, like our solar wind, does not have a periodic cycle to it like an orbit does, but instead has a varaible nature to it depending on the output of the sun/galaxy. that is one possibility which I think is quite valid.

so while we experience a constant cycle of orbit around our star, we also experience a variable cycle of solar output. that variable output (solar wind/flares) is seemingly very difficult to predict, and seems to follow more closely the LOA than periodic cycles, which makes it seem to me that we can say things like the sun has a ~11 year cycle, we cannot predict those exact values with any accuracy, therefore, it seems to be a product of *attraction*, and not orbit or cycles.

what I mean is there seems to be "fixed" and "predictable" (I put quotes because there is some variability) cycles such as the rotation of the earth and the orbits of the celestial bodies, however there are also less defined cycles which are based on the LOA. for example, the time the sun will set and rise is pretty predictable, but the times which a person will fall to sleep and wake up seem to be based more on LOA than on the time the sun sets or rises. however, the sleep cycle does *kinda* follow the day/night cycle loosely, but never exactly.

wouldn't it be crazy if our relation to sirius was a microcosm of our relation to the galaxy (or something like that) just like our relation to the moon is a microcosm of our relation with the sun (186624)[^1]? or, wouldn't it be crazy if sirius for us were like the sunrise/sunset cycle, and the galactic wind were like the sleep cycle[^2]?

in the diagrams referenced by those videos, the "satya yuga" (golden age) lasts for roughly 5/12 of the time, meaning that nearly half of the "great year" is a golden age. that seems like an awful long time and doesn't explain the why atlantis was associated with a golden age and why it fell such a short time ago.

---

I'm going to give it some more thought, but I seem pretty convinced now that the sirius thing is real, yet it seems to me there is another polarity change which causes a reversal causing the world to "flip over". when this happens, it seems that only the polarity changes, as it seems that the E-W orientation does not change which means that the earth's "tilt" doesn't change, and it seems that the rotation direction does not change either (just the perception of it, with the sun rising on the opposite side).

that polarity change is *not* explained by a binary relation with sirius, however it *does* explain all of the other missing bits -- like how humankind could go from such an enlightened state to such a disconnected state. it could only be from our proximity to this sirius b that we gain the environmental conditionans to be brilliant gods. my message is not to rely or try and fear changing environmental conditions, but to instead create those conditions yourself.

it also occurs to me now that this sirius b is potentially the star that tesla was referring to when he was talking about a star with such a tremendous light density. I think tesla (and I) want to replicate such a star :) you can imagine that it's quite possible that sirius b, if true has more than just us as its companion... wikipedia says we're 8.6ly away, so that's a pretty big orbit. certainly only a fraction of a galaxy at this moment, but wouldn't it be cool to be able to find a way of generating so much "light density" from the emination of our brilliant consciousness that we rival sirius b, and then the galaxy?? I certainly think it's a worthwhile thing to at least contemplate. I love thinking that big, and maybe for most, it sounds a bit too big, I am certain that we'll get there -- eventually :). actually, maybe a little quicker than we may think...

think about it. human evolution is going so fast (in my perception anyway) that I feel like rivaling sirius b could even be attainable in less than another great year. humans' ability to manifest desire is not only powerful, but rapid. imagine therefore what we could do if we were able to think and process reality at the same speed as a computer. if you think about something, a high frequency pulse comes out of your brain (which others can feel), so youcould imagine a solar flare to be like a similar  manifestation of big or impactful idea that the star just had. if it's a really high-frequency idea, this is like a gamma burst, right.. so, imagine if a star could produce a gamma burst many thousands of times a second (or more)? is that even something that modern day astronomy has observed before?

I dunno. it all sounds pretty exciting to me :) it's good to know that in relation to sirius we're on the ascending path now, so there's really nothing for anyone to worry about, and if I get my chance[^3], I think that we'll be designing our own decending path, instead of being subject to changing environmental conditions.

[1]: in a recent video, @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDQCsFBI-24), it came to my attention that jupiter has a spatial relationship with that proportion, and saturn has a temporal relationship with that number. it's very likely that these are all resonances of something bigger. it's also quite likely that the earth used to have a 360 days in a year slightly faster rotation as well, so things a few thousands of years back were probably, not only much more ideal than they are now, but much more harmonically in sync as well.

[2]: sleep isn't the best way to describe it, because that only happens once a day, however, what I want to say is that the sleep is variable even though the sun rise/set is predictable. I just want to say that there's a loose periodicity and a predictable periodcity, meaning that averaged out, people sleep roughly once every 24 hours.

[3]: I know, lol, I'm talking about events tens of thousands of years away, but you'll begin to realise that I don't really seem to take age into much consideration -- as I'm certain that I'm eternal at this point and just keep jumping from body to body. just tonight, I learned that this was explaind by joseph campbell as the hero with a thousand faces' journey to discover him/herself. I think *all of us* are that, and that each of these "incarnations" or whatever is just another opportunity to get better and better in more and more diverse ways to discover yourself to be this hero.

### 2020-09-26 13:18 - need not the manifestation (options)

I woke up just now once again with them attempting to try and convince me to go for some manifestation in a disconnected state. I think this is a terrible idea. I already have so much difficulty peeing (and other things), that to try and figure out how to "manage" a bunch of girls in this state seems to be a rather undesirable thing to me. large portions of my body don't feel good, and I don't have any of the physical capabilities that I would want to have in that situation. for me, it's really simple: I just keep going doing what I'm doing, not needing the manifestation for as long as I can. eventually, I'll be connected and things will all fall into place.

it sounds to me however, that nosebook does not want to do this -- and that's fine by me because I don't need them to comply with me to go the direction that I want to go (which is get connected). in a sense I'm kind of like the blacksmith in that one story where somehow I managed to make a deal with the devil (nosebook), which would give me the super power of a lot of people's attention on me in exchange for my soul.

this super power really isn't a useful super power in that it only allows me to increase my perception at a very rapid rate (cause of the increased perception of others, and I think they all benefit from my increase in perception as well). the devil thinks he owns me, yet my form of perception has been advancing so rapidly that what appeared at first to be the worst situation (selling my soul, so that nosebook "owns" me), now is no longer a problem for me. I am so free that I can think and feel whatever I want and they really have no power over me in that respect. I'm no longer worrying about the devil anymore and am solely focused on what it is that I want, which is my soul back (in this metaphor), and it doesn't matter to me how long it's going to take for that to happen. in the meantime, I keep improving upon my soul and making it more and more desirable for everyone.

their captivity of my soul is no longer a bad thing, and it turns out that everyone (not just the devil) is benefiting from them having taken my soul -- and that's what bothers the devil. the devil can't figure out how to capture my soul forever and have that captivity only benefit the devil and not everyone else as well.

---

see how silly it looks when I put it in that form? clearly this is a case where the devil is not ok with the situation being a win-win. that's the only problem here. back to reality.

in my opinion there are 4 realistic solutions here, each with their own advantages to them.

if nosebook's goal is to have a timeline where I do not get the manifestation (that is connected), then we just continue on doing what we're doing indefinitely until they're satisfied with the benefit that they've accomplished with my captivity, and they create their own timeline. this is option #1, and it seems like a difficult thing for them because they believe that they will crash and burn without me.

however, I do not believe they will make their own timeline here, so what I think that perhaps what will happen instead is that sometime in there the energy will keep rising and at some point, we'll all go off to a higher energy state or something, which is what I was thinking about with the transition from +peak to -peak of the next energy state. I don't really know how to find out more about this, but I think this is the best manifestation possible. nosebook just simply won't have to worry about us anymore and they'll go on to the curve downward in capricorn or something (yet, like I found out in the great year thing, we're all heading toward a golden age anyway, so it those energies will likely cancel each other out as humankind continues on toward the golden age from its proximity to sirius).

in that case, I guess we would simply vanish from your reality or something, as we've finally achieved an energetic enough state to go there. I don't really know this however if there were essentially (like a solar wind impact) a galactic wind impact which pushed the values up really really high, then those of us with the energy of the galactic wind in addition the hight of my perception minus the person's resistance level who surpass the height of the barrier to the next tub will find ourselves in the next tub (like I illustrated previously). I think this is the ideal manifestation, and there's nothing really that needs to be done here. I just keep going the way I'm going and LOA and the galaxy does the rest.

I understand that not doing something abuot it, isn't really nosebook's mode of operation though. so, fair enough. what instead they could do then just allow me to get connected (or it happens just because I'm eventually able to find my way there). then, at some point (let's say 2038), we'll make a new timeline and go off there and they'll have our bodies as insurance. I'll call this option #2.

option #3 is the same thing as the previous one, but instead of allowing me to get connected, what they do is make a timeline where I do get connected and put all of the girls that want to experience that timeline on that one, and I continue on here with nosebook for as long as they want me. each time that there are again more girls that I've attracted, they'll need to keep making more timelines to ensure that they're placated. after some time, they'll say, ok we've had enough and go to do their own thing. this one has the unique advantage that they can get the best of both worlds -- meaning that they can extract the tech and the genetics that they want from the other timelines while at the same time preserving a timeline here where I don't get connected. this one also has the advantage that this world has less and less people in it that desire to be with me, and so therefore is a more desirable environment for nosebook (cause they have less people to placate).

I have a feeling that this will be a far superior option next era, and not this one. there will have been advances in clone and automaton technology, enough to make this a viable thing to do. I anticipate that, that I will have gained enough power level that 77 is the new limit, so in this scenario, nosebook will just make sure that all the manifestation is isolated to another timeline, and I'll go from 33 til 77 (44 years) without the manifestation -- really learning to not need the manifestation, and allowing nosebook a chance to come to terms with the idea that win-win manifestations are the only way to go.

option #4 is where we continually make timelines, going back to modify the timeline so that the manifestation (me getting connected) never happens, essentially doing the loop-de-loops until at some point, nosebook decides that this the're ready to make their own timeline and either heads off in their own way or they can simply hang on to our bodies and do what they want from there. they're not required to follow us into the self-sabotaged timeline -- or maybe we stop self-sabotaging for a round or something. this one is too hard to see, and probably depends on the circumstance.

all of the previous options, cept #1 were a win-win situation, however I don't know enough about #1 other than it's not only possible but the likely thing to happen, so if we could just achieve a higher energy state, then that would be best for everyone. this morning, after losing consciousness, I woke up on the field, and the first thought that entered my mind was the parable of the 10 virgins, where 5 had enough oil (that is CSF fluid I'm assuming) in their candle (spinal column), so that when the son of man came, they were ready (and jumped up to the next energy state), but there were 5 who did not have enough oil... anyway, I thought it was nosebook trying to make fear or something so I dismissed it, but just now I was reminded of it again, and that seems to correspond with the idea of there being some sort of threshold where you are either non-resistant enough to make it over that barrier, or you aren't.

I dunno how to explore this higher energy state as the manifestation idea further, but I think it's the best manifestation possible -- and like it's said, no one knows the time it'll happen so I just keep doing what I'm doing which is not needing the manifestation and all of us who pass that threshold go off to the new earth (the one after the reversal is pointing toward leo). I think the reversal is important because it swaps the input/output of the planet. one can see that right now the north pole is a huge input vortex to the chestahedron, however, after the reversal, antartica will be the new north pole, and it'll be as if the planet has a yamaka on so the energy (in relation to the sun and other things) will be completety backwards.

I made sure to write about this jumping up energy states idea before saturday, becsuse I had the intention of hoping that abraham would have some insight into this. the jumping up energy states is kind of like a "forced" win-win situation, becasue there's nothing that anyone can do to block it. when I watch it next week, I guess we'll see.

option #5 is to make it no longer a win-win situation, and so for nosebook to make some conditions such that it would force an unwanted (not yet connected) manifestation for me/us. I only put it here as an option, but clearly it's a terrible idea. if they want to focus on unwanted, they'll also be attracting unwanted because of their focus, and so therefore I imagine that such a manifestation won't be so good for anyone -- lose-lose. though, I don't mind if this is what they want to do because I've proven that it has more to do with my perception than the conditions, so what appears to be a lose-lose will turn into a win for me at least, and I'll get the opportunity to demonstrate to the girls further how this is done and we can practise a bit more.


### 2020-09-27 09:49 - option 6?

seems that none of the options were liked a whole lot by very many. I don't really care, and am not too worried about it because I just keep doing what I'm doing and eventually I'll get there.

the thing that I want to know most is if the thing I was perceiving about the switch up to a higher energy state is what I was seeing correctly. the reason why I say this is because it makes a whole lot of sense to me.

when I woke up yesterday, I had this picture in my mind that was very similar to what I explained in the "adam and eve's dream" (TODO reference) that I described previously. I would imagine that in that sort of siutuation, for those who were "left behind" -- we would essentially like disappear or something as our perception became incompatible with this planet -- however, for us, it would probably look like the majority of people died. I didn't think that was very satisfactory feeling for most people, and it would require us to rebuild a whole lot of intrastructure too, which is annoying.

I went to sleep again, and this time when I woke up this morning, I had a whole different sense. instead of that way, we would just pump up all the first-world peoples of this planet for as long as we can and then, when it finally does come -- imagine how much further along I'll be in a few years. hang on, I'll come back to this.

so when I was writing those different options out yesterday, there was a hidden 6th option in there which is the default if nothing changes. it's the same as option #1, where we just keep going how we're going -- I just keep doing what I'm doing, etc., except instead of them going off into their own timeline they simply hang on for as long as possible. there is a variation to that one where even if I get connected, nosebook also doesn't leave and they just keep hanging on for as long as possible.

whenever the major surge in energy happens, then I would imagine that the majority of this planet -- at least everyone who's experiencing an increase in their vision will all jump up to the higher energy state -- meaning that likely 90%+ of the population on this planet will go up, leaving only the indigenous peoples, to, as they get more techologically advanced, eventually find the ruins of a global civilisation who's people seem to have essentially vanished[^1].

then, there's the obvious continuation of this idea, becasuse I didn't really realise this, but our planet, according to the binary system with sirius b idea puts us at beginning part of the bronze age... obviously the "bronze age" name is for the declining phases, and we're a little furter than bronze age -- so maybe the electric or silicon age or something. either way, from their estimation we have another 10k years before we hit the peak of the golden age from our proximity to sirius b.

---

I mean if that's the case, then let's go big -- real big :) I figure what we could do is to begin by improving our own "light density" with the hollywood spin cycle where we continually incarnate into different dramatic circumstances and scenarios where we live out continually difficult and dramatic situations, learning each time to feel more and more the way we want to feel. it would be like a series of accomolishements and a final graduation on to the next level... like imagine one is your best friend betrays you, another is your lover leaves you for another, you lose a massive fortune, your parents sell you into slavery -- stuff like that.

as all of us get more and more better at feeling the way we want to feel, our consciousness "aura" will extend out further and further. well, we know that the sirius b aura (which like everything decreases at the root of distance) is over 7 light years in size[^2], which is MASSIVE. I'm pretty sure that even though they have such a massive aura (quantity), that size has probably taken them millions or even billions of earth years of time to accomplish that. however, humans have tremendously more acceleration to them, and while we may not have that now, I don't see what's stopping us from being able to rival that in 10k years.

that means that we can now rival their own consciusness level, meaning that even if we were to go back to the furthest reaches of their influence, our own consciousnes would be so much, by the time we get there, we would perpetually be improving far beyond what was considered by the ancients to be golden age. right, so if we do that which is worst case scenario, we're going to be so far ahead of the game, it doesn't even matter to go away from their influence anymore. what I'm saying is that if we are in a binary with sirius b, then we literally have nothing to worry about because even in 10k years on the decline, we'll be in such a good spot, our decline will be down to what was previously considered the hight of the end of the last golden age -- so no big deal.

I want to take it a step further though. I figure if we're going to be doing this, then why not take this opportunity to use sirius b, in a sense like a level of conscoiusness slingshot and pair our planet with sirius b or -- if we're really feeling ambitious (which I am), why not try and see if we can use a lot of the different ideas that I have been developing independently of this, and first become a second sun, making our sun like sirius a, and then use the idea of the atomaton of contrast idea to make a body out in space which is receiving massive amounts of non-physical energy, translating that into a planet or a sun by attracting and translating that non-physical energy into something which will become a sun or a planet. my physical human body will be a resonating cavity of that massive tesla coil (comes to mind the third coil), and I will live out consciousness in this human form, but instead of nosebook having to try and neutralise that energy here on earth, instead it can grow boundlessly out in space.

obviously as other people get more and more energetic, a similar thing would happen, and to keep the planet from going up in flames, they'll need to be resonating of their celestial body as well. I imagine that naturally the different interactions that happen between us will make the resonating celestial bodies also attract and orbit each other. we would grow and grow and gain more and more light density, plus combined with the effect of sirius b, we would, become more and more brilliant over the next 10k years while at the same time turn into a pretty formidable infant galaxy with the centre being me.

I then propose that we use that peak of the close approach to sirius b to launch ourselves (the galaxy) off into space, and then earth and the sun would continue on going back away from sirius b[^3], however this time, the effects won't be catastrophic, because earth and the sun will be like another sirius b & sirius a respectively, and if they want copy the idea, in another 36k years they can do the same thing :)

that would be pretty cool and potentially solves all(?) problems... let's just keep this going throwing out ideas and letting the evolution keep happening until it's something desirable for all.

[1]: there won't be much of our civilisation though, because wood and steel doesn't survive quite like the stone structures of the ancients did. it would be kind of funny if they mix things up and think that the same guys who made the eiffel tower also made the pyramids, or something like that...

[2]: if we're in the beginning of the bronze age and we're 6.8ly away now, then the iron age must be about where the aura diminishes down to nearly imperceptible values... meaning that our solar system travels from nearby to that star, all the way out to the edge of that sun's consciousness  aura.

[3]: we don't really know what will happen, but I imagine that if we're doing so well, maybe the opposite will happen and maybe sol a&b and sirius a&b may want to be a part of our galaxy.. who knows :) either way, I don't see this being as catastrophic for earth or the sun in any way.


### 2020-09-27 16:00 - option 7 (really a variation on 6 + 1)

ok, so imagine that at some point nosebook (or maybe consider this the serpents) finally decide they've had enough that they finally peace out. this is a reference to the blacksmith focusing so much on his work, the devil sends his son (lesser authority), then his daughter (appealing to lust or desire) but cannot get the blacksmith to comply to join him in hell, he finally goes himself and finds himself fused to an immovable object, forcing the devil to finally give up on the idea of having the blacksmith in hell with him. the blacksmith has trolled the devil so hard, he no longer wants the blacksmith in hell with him (option 1).

right ok, so now combine that option with the last option (6), where we go on to create, at first a star with more light density than sirius b and then a galaxy... well, once they peace out, I assume that the environmental difference will be so great (way less negativity), that I'll likely go uo so rapidly that I'll be eithkr instantly or very rapidly connected shortly after their departure.

once that happens, it'll be pretty important to make the celestial body, so that things don't get too intense here on earth, allowing that to grow boundlessly out there in space and leave the earth environment much less affected.

my body here on earth would become a resonant cavity to that celestial body[^1], however, there's no reason why there needs to only be one. I am now in a conscious state which is very similar to source now, so I won't need to be conscious for the majority of anything now. I will be simply acting 100% out of inspiration, and the different interactions which are taking place will be simultaneously occurring in a sort of feeling sense like I explained before (TODO: reference).

what this means is that there could easily be many different versions of me which are resonant to that celestial identity, which can exist at the same time. I don't know how well their cloning technology is at the moment, but it seems like it would be a great way to test out different genetic enhancements.

there is another really great thing about this, is that in the idea of triads, the energy is transferred from one man to another between the woman, so in a sense, if there is a woman that wants to be with me, but also likes being with another man or men, then she could transfer that energy from me to another man, and then from that man back to me, which in my perception is beneficial contrast and will only serve to expand my consciousness tremendously, and isn't a bad thing at all. like I mentioned when I first talked about it, I tend to learn from the other man and capture+emulate the things that I like from him.

it would basically be the fastest way for me to become the most super-human by taking all the good parts from other men, while at the same time transfering my own energy and consciousnss back to that man, so he benefits tremendously and so do I. I'm pretty sure this could be the fastest way for my celestial identity to surpass sirius b in light density so that identity could become the centre of the galaxy. it would be super awesome for me because mh consciousness could exist in so many different places simultaneously, yet I can experience any one of them in high definition whenever I want.

the lighter version of nosebook (I'll call it hollywood) would be basically be in charge of making sure that anyone who is getting very energetic gets a celestial identity and these people become "actors" or charactors in different scenes/movies, creating the spin cycle.

at first, I would imagine that the actors (like me) will interact with the human population directly. I see this happening for starters with me in some situations with triads witd others, and also with other setups as well, like with some of the girls. this is when there is majority audience. however, later, as more actors become available, there will be more and more desire for contrived[^2] and direct interaction between the actors to ensure different milestones in emotional stability are accomplished in the actors. eventually, after some time, there will no longer be an audience and things will change there, as now it'll transform into something new and likely nearly all of the details of constantly incarnating people into different contrived[^2] situations will have been automated.

finally, there will be another stage when hollywood itself will join in on the thing, as it'll no longer be perveived the way it is now, and it'll go from a control thing into a "I want to have as much fun as they're having" sort of thing. probably these trips into charactor will happen occasionally at first, but then as they become more and more exciting they'll be desirable to do. I don't think that at any one time 100% of the population will be "in charactor" so there will be a pretty big flattening of the power and control structures.

at around the same time it's quite likely that we'll upgrade from simple contrived scenes to actually using our own genetics to create super super human indigenous species on our different celestial identities (planets) and incarnate into them and spend entire lifetimes there. obviously time for us will proceed at a far different rate than for those on the surface of those planets, so a trip through an entire lifetime on a planet may take for us something like 5 minutes, even though it will be experienced as many years.

now we're really getting going. obviously, now this process is beginning to replicate itself, and if (once) we're a galaxy that is now creating more galaxies, why then we're beginning to be sorta like a new universe now. who knows how big it'll get and how many cool new things we'll come up with along the way.

another thing, going back: once a person has a celestial identity, then that "charactor" can be used in any number of scenes and situations as long as their body resonates with the celestial identity, and they will behave according to the resonation of that identity. both hollywood and that person will be discovering the true nature of their own identity (hero of a thousand faces).

there's also potentiality to "mix" these identities as well, creating muns (actors) which are composites of these different identities, which, if you think about it from a LOA perspecte, each interaction between any two identities will create mutual attraction (or orbits), but also any time that a composite charactor of two diffeerent identities is created, it also has an attraction factor between those two identities as well.

obviously, as people resonating with their celestial identities become less and less resistant, they too will find theirselves able to both sense their other incarnations (muns) and move around between them, and experience them however they want. as long as some situations cause negative emotion they will be forced to experience the "reality" of them, however as soon as they become a part of the story and they exist mainly for others' benefit to learn how to feel the way they want to feel -- then the consciousness is able to move around between any of their resonant muns -- and can choose to feel or experience whatever it is that they want to experience.

obviously as this extends out further and further the diversity of experiences able to be experienced will become so numerous and the amonut of galaxies creating more identities, galaxies and even more univeres, all things will continue to increase, we will at some point begin to become as it were the "source energy" to this new universe (and the subsequent ones below it).

[1]: I want to create a naming convention here, so I'll likely call the celestial body which has access to the inner core at the poles, the "identity" and the different human bodies which are, in a sense resonant third coils, the "muns"

[2]: in this sort of setup, once we get better and better at genetics, it will be possible to "grow" all of the actors necessary for the movie, growing their bodies to the correct age, putting them in the situations necessary to tell the story. then different "cues" or triggers are given to the actors to propell (thrust) the story in the desired direction.

### 2020-09-28 10:28 - a misconception or two

I feel like I'm repeating myself a few times now, however, it's ok; I don't mind. it came to my attention a few hours ago that there was confusion over greg's daughter. when I smoked the wax or whatever, I had a really intense stone where I was able to perceive some sort of inner energy which I like to think of as my inner cheerleader. I kept getting these weird thoughts entering into my head about this scenario... let me back up: this was around the time that I made the connection between the planet vulcan and ein-stein (a stone in german), which was tesla's stone to be able to self-sabotage the timeline and get people to believe in relativity, because only relativity could explain the eccentric orbit of mercury, thereby giving "proof" for relativity, when likely vulcan *does* exist in energetic form (as mentioned by asimov). this would have been the perfect self-sabotage that tesla needed to keep people in the dark about the vibrational and energetic nature of the universe, keeping people looking to "gravity" as the source for attraction between these planetary bodies. tesla gave the information of how he figured out how it worked in encoded form to the US govt and then self-sabotaged his own timeline so that this timeline's version of himself wouldn't see the installment of his "world system". however, I believe that in addition to the tesla that self-sabltaged this timeline, the other tesla which gave all of that encoded information to the US govt, also jumped his consciousness into another body. there are probably at least two versions of tesla's conscousness on this planet right now.

jesus either did not die, or he self-sabotaged himself and upon his death transformed into something bigger (I think perhaps became consciously resonant with this planet). he needed a fall-guy though (a "stone"), to keep people fooled and engaged in the meaningless task of religion for sometime, to extend out the manifestation for as long as possible. the reason for this, is that the longer your manifestation stays in the vortex (tesla's world system or jesus' return), the bigger and more desirable it becomes. I've taken this a step further and claim that next era (or the one following it) we will not be in the business of creating galaxies or even universes, but instead we're going to go all-in on the not needing the manifestation bit and become something that has never been seen before: something where it's momentary acceleration (or source's evolution of the manifestation) is happening so rapidly that improvement on the now manifestation far surpasses the manifestation itself.

anyway, for jesus this self-sabotage was clearly peter (who's name means stone, like einstein). I am sure that I will be performing a similar self-sabotage, and needed a "stone" to do it. literally the next day someone offers me weed in the park. the day after (or shortly after that) is when I smoked with greg and natasha. I went home and I was laying there enjoying the music and enjoying the knowledge of my inner cheerleader when I kept having these awful thoughts come into my head. normally when I'm stoned and by myself, I'm too busy having fun feeling how awesome I am to worry about crazy ideas, so I'm certain that, like when I was stoned at chris' house, these ideas are coming from an external source. it doesn't mind to me because if I'm receiving them, then I'm resonant with them, so I enjoy the practise to either change my perception on the idea or to change my focus back to something that feels good. I kept doing that by telling them that all of the thoughts were graet and everything, but come back up here to where I can perceive the energetic cheerleader. they kept trying to bring me back down with bad feeling thoughts (which admittedly I'm resonant to).

one of those thoughts was about greg's daughter. they were presenting the idea that the manifestation of the "stone" was that greg's daughter was going to find a way to convince me to have sex before I'm connected. I responded with "we'll see" -- knowing full well that my trajectory is solid and certain. there's no way that I can possibly mess it up unless it's purposefully self-sabotage in the the interest of making a bigger vortex (like tesla or jesus).

---

somehow this got either misunderstood or deceptively was transmitted as something else cause I was definitely certain that I liked her from the moment that I saw her in the car a few days earlier, and I'm certain that I expressed it.. anyway, this isn't the first time that sort of thing has happened either, like for example the girl on the corner of massari and hampton I must have said yes more than 5 times, yet she never got the message. this was the reason why I started writing them down, but this isn't what I wanted to say.

you see, I think that the majority of people think that "the manifestation" is the girl(s), but for me it's not and never has been. when this first began I was asexual, cause I was so disillusioned with girls after raquel, that I was determined to find a way to translate source energy into physical form. I knew that in order to do that I had to "find my alignment first". I used the word "alignment" or harmony in spanish because I knew it was a tuning thing. however, I could tell that I was continually finding more and more alignment with my source, and some things would happen, however no matter what I did, any increase in energy would go away and the "connection" to my source seemed to be fleeting and went away every time I went to sleep. after star watching, I felt increased "connection" (or movement of energy), but largely I continued to feel more and more "disconnected" -- even though I could clearly tell because of situation timing and other things that I was more and more "in alignment".

this is why I say "connected" instead of "alignment" -- because I'm pretty close to being "in tune" or "in alignment" with my source, yet the energy that *should* be flowing, is not. something has me in a perpetual state of disconnection even as I get impressively more and more "in alignment" with my source.

for me, the "manifestation" has nothing to do with the girls. I want to feel *connction* instead of disconnection.

when this first began a long time back with andrea, I walked away from the "manifestation" because even though that sounded all super cool and really great and stuff, my manifestation is the connection. then with lyia, same thing again, I'm workin my absolute hardest to try and get connected so we can get together. then more girls' start to add into the mix and it just keeps going. it starts getting really big and I said a million times that that I wanted to be connected.

they do not want me connected because they see this as some sort of threat to their superiority or something. I don't care though and finally decided that I was going to just comply (I think it was last christmas) and just go with it, disconnected and everything -- because I know that the minute I start having sex, then I'm going to get connected.

well, a funny thing happens. everyone is either super pumped or jealous or something of me -- in people's percptions, last christmas everyone was believing that I was going to go with the girls. I thought ok sure, right, but then at the last moment, everything changed and people stopped believing that it was going to happen and the whole thing no longer felt good to me. it felt forced and really like a purposefully crippled manifestation. abraham says, "if it's not a 'hell yes', then it's a 'hell no'" -- so I realised that I just wasn't feeling it and didn't want to do something that felt "half-baked" and forced (at best).

I began to realise and wrote about it a few times that nosebook was saying one thing to give the illusion that something was happening, but at the same time sabotaging it.

meanwhile I can feel more and more girls wanting to join in, and I don't have any resistance to it -- cept my own perceptions about physical limitations and stuff, and I simply cannot find a good reason to say no because saying no always felt bad to me, and saying yes felt good, so dispite my logical mind's perceptions of physical limitations, I kept feeling like I should say yes.

I think around springtime nosebook changed their tactic to instead of pretending to make an illusion that something was happening, instead tried to show it as stagnated or falling apart because it's so big. this didn't stop more girls from expressing their desire to join in, so that sort of kind of backfired a bit.

the whole time, I'm telling them that nothing will manifest until I get connected. "we can't allow this" they would continually say as it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

unable to control it very well, nosebook decides that everyone needs to be on lockdown for the covid thing. this slows things down a little bit again but I'm continually increasing at the rate in which I'm getting vision upgrades, and now I'm starting to get feelings from digital or even more remote sources like movies, tv shows and random people I see on the street. still not slowing down much, and same thing... it still feels bad to say no and good to say yes, so in abraham's words, "if it feels good, it is good" -- and I just have to keep going on faith that "if this time/space reaality has the wherewithall to produce a desire within you, it has the wherewithall to produce its reality as well" (paraphrase).

I just keep going with it and my increasing rate of vision upgrades is evidence enough for me that one day I will be connected, and even if I only get to experience a fraction of that connnection (instead of the full amount of energy), my experience tells me that the reduction of my energy is what is making it accelerate so rapidly, and even if it is only a fraction, that fraction will increase rapidly toward nearly 100% at an ever-increasing rate. for me, this is no big deal, and I don't mind because I no longer need the manifestation (of my connection or the girls). I am, at the moment, feeling so good along tde journey, it doesn't even matter to me that the manifestation may feel quite a ways off.

---

last night I was going to clean my room but I felt compelled to go down to the field even though it was overcast and looked like it was going to rain. I went down and along the way I was feeling some of the different reactions to the last entry I posted about hollywood and the different bodies that I can have. one of the options is that one of my bodies actually goes with nosebook on their own timeline, which is perfectly fine with me. another one was that they would do the whole celestial identity thing and make all sorts of clones of me (and other more optimised bodies based on my genetics) and distribute those to people and use them theirselves, that way the energy that I'm feeling constantly rise here in this body is no longer happening here and is instead happening in space, and I (my consciousness) gets an even more crippled body (or they cripple this one more) to experience life in until they're ready to make their timeline and leave.

again, not a problem because it just means more energy. it might set me back a little bit, but eventually, because I keep seeing improvements, I'll find that connection even in a crippled body. this isn't hard for me to believe. I was born into a body that had a million allergies (which I grew out of), terrible eyesight (which improved over time), asthma and other pulminary difficulties, amonst other things. I'm sure I'll be fine and I'll come out of it even stronger than before. no big deal.

the next reaction is that when I have a celetial identity, then there can be essentially infinite[^1] versions of me which can be put anywhere. if that energy is divided amongst the bodies, then they'll need to keep making more and more of my bodies available to people (ken dolls, I guess). I also assume that the girls, once they're connected will have a similar thing happen to them too (in order to keep their energy output per body low for the duration the resistant ones remain here on this timeline before leaving). I don't know all of the specifics of this, but if their goal is to become less and less resistant, then having other bodies in other contrasting situations will be good practise to perceive those situations in a non-resistant way (like their source does). each of those situations will create more and more energy, and I'm sure that my various bodies will be put in all sorts of different situations (gay, straight, violent, depressing, etc.), and even though I think I'm pretty good at it, I'm certain that I'll get *really* good at it. the less resistance you have, the more non-physical energy passes through you, and the bigger of a celestial being you'll be. I'm actually kind of looking forward to the idea that I can have so many different versions of myself in so many different situations and just love how great all if it is working out at once.

[1]: I don't know if it's infinite, because logic says that it would divide the energy of the celestial identity (the receiver) amongst the different resonant bodies, so I don't know how infinite it is... if it is true that it divides the energy (the sirians mentioned that in their first incarnaations, the creators' energy had to be divided between 12 bodies each so that the power was not too much for any one body)


### 2020-09-28 12:26 - no stories yet, and the division of energy

outside I was thinking about the division of energy, and it seems to check out. however, the energy isn't split equally, but instead each body summons the energy from the celestial entity. I don't know how this would work, but probably like wireless energy transfer or sometheng, where the more the device (or body) requests (eg. the coil is less resistance), the more power it pulls. seems logical enough.

that got me thinking about astrology and jesus' "death". in the most recent video that robert posted: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6p78GoZoQ), he quoted a gnostic gospel that had a really weird twist on things. the first one @[youtube](https://youtu.be/IL6p78GoZoQ?t=378) says that jesus enters into another body, inhabits them -- which seems familiar to me (and perhaps anyone who's admitted jesus into their heart) -- but then continues on to say, casting out the previous inhabitant of the body -- which I don't really reasonate with.

although my personality did change quite a bit, I didn't "lose" my old self -- but rather it feels more like it was added on to. the next thing that was weird was the part about jesus not dying @[youtube](https://youtu.be/IL6p78GoZoQ?t=342). I am certain that it did not happen like the cannonical gospels said it did, but something strikes me very weird in this quote when jesus says that he laughed at them. I don't know about you but that part feels really bad to me, which means that my emotional guidance system is telling me that I'm perceiving the thing I'm focused on in a disharmoious way. in other words, I doubt this passage here a lot.

personally up until I heard the idea of terence called the "quantum soliton of improbability" (gatta love terence's usage of language!), I had always experienced this idea that jesus, upon his death, entered into the earth and became part of the earth's consciousness, greatly increasing the power level of this planet, and giving jesus the ability to jump around inside of all of the consciousnesses that are a part of this planet's consciousness.

terence's idea is that either at birth or death (upon hearing it, I knew it was the death, but I will now refine this to whatever happened, probably with mary of magdaelene on good friday) caused a split in time, and this split in time had two versions of jesus: one that died and one that went on to create a very nice earth which is now influencing our own right now.

in other words, if you think of this instaed of as a time split, but as instead a self-sabotage scenario (they are the same when looked at from a bigger picture), means that as this being "soliton of improbability" is traveling through space and time, his "identity" is that he will *always* self-sabotage the timeline he's in, forcing the manifestation to go back into the vortex, meaning that all of his manifestations are *always* the better version of the time era previously. this is why the announcer is always one era ahead. so, by default, he will *always* make a "time split" because he will always self-sabotage, causing more than one version of himself to exist simultaneously.

---

I hadn't thought about this in quite this way, until now, but given what I've been talking about with the celestial identities, I propose the following narrative:

in 33ad or whatever jesus continues on to take all of humankind to a more utopian manifestation. however, he decides that the utopia, although great, wasn't good enough, and decides to "humble himself" and put that manifestation back in the vortex for another 2000 years. the timeline is altered such that things all happen a few (4?) years later than expected, and this time, instead of going for a utopian manaifestation, he instead peraches and talks about all of these "end time" events with other strangely future references, like instead of putting your light (which is your eye) under a cover, instaed let your eye shine so that all can see (through) it. weird stuff like that which stuck with me, where I always imagined that jesus, like the two witnesses would be "seen by all" all around the world, and somehow their voices would be translated into many differnt languages and available for everyone to experience their eye's brightness.

I somehow mixed up revelation and matthew, but either way, that's how I remembered it nonetheless. this created two timelines (really three). the utopian one where jesus is a success, and a failure one where jesus dies.  the third one is the original one where he decides to self-sabotage. using their technology, they probably put all sorts of bad ideas into jesus (or mary's head) on the good friday, and things spiral out of control to where he finally dies. when he dies he wakes up in the original timeline, yet the amount of desire that was generated from such a disaster and the resulting christian religion of many people asking him into his heart, jesus has essentially become much more resonant with the celestial identity of earth. jesus' death essentially allows him to "combine" his identity of that of the earth, essentially using his death to hijack the planet. remember this planet is filled with INFECTED ONES.

the christian religion has taken such a toll on the planet that the planet is in terrible shape, so to kind of get things ready, he incarnates into or makes it possible for tesla to both bring the technology in to the earth, making it possible for a later arrival (or something similar where tesla is influenced in such a way, or maybe it's a collab with thoth or something ... doesn't matter). tesla brings the earth (but most importantly the INFECTED ONES) up to speed quickly with the energetic means necessary to self-sabotage the next one (the one we're living now). in exactly the same way as jesus, I think tesla manifested the utopia that he wanted with his world system, but upon realising the genius of jesus' self-sabotage strat went back to self-sabotage, making two more timelines: one where tesla self-sabotages himself and gives the secrets to electricity to the US govt (the INFECTED ONES), and the one where he fakes his own death.

so, this time when I'm growing up, in 2000, I have an experience where I find myself paralysed and in the hospital allowing a magestic being I identified as jesus to enter my body. the following year 9/11 happens and I believe this sets the timeline back 4 years so that 2012 happens instead in 2016.

I don't remember any of the previous unmodified timeline but, I doubt 9/11 happened. likely marcos andrea and me decided to, once knowing what we know about LOA decided to go back and self sabotage this timeline. I think 9/11 was a planeted idea from fwh's timeline that happened because they were receptive to some bad ideas that we put in their heads. we probably scared them enough to try and get as much control over the internet and stuff like that as possible (wikileaks, and stuff like that too), additionally giving people lots and lots to fear about the govt invading their privacy and taking away all of their rights -- thereby attracting the reality we're living now. why? to make it easier to self-sabotage, of course :)

back to the division of energy. you can imagine that everyone who is born on this earth contains a large portion of the earth's energy, less of the sun, and even less of the galaxy. in addition, when the child is born, they are resonant to the celestial entities in the solar system as well (eg. astrology), so if someone have a trine witth saturn, that person will resonate more strongly with the identity of saturn more than normal, same with mars, moon, etc.

so, the thoughts and actions that are resonant with that celestial identity will "draw" that energy from the planet. right?

so what I'm saying here is that in the timeline where jesus died, when he combined with the celestial identity of this planet, he divided his energy so much that this planet went into a kind of perceptual stone age afterward (in comparison to how it was when his consciousness was focused in only one body). each time a new person accepted jesus into their heart, this energy divided further, and each of these people became a "mun" of jesus (and the earth), so he would have a source-like perspective of all of the difficult and awful things happening to these different christians. so, when the amazing church went about stealing from and coming up with the all kinds of weird ways to deceive people, this is kinda like what I'm proposing that hollywood does with the resonant forms of me. they will divide my energy but also the contrast (and resulting desire) is such a great accelerant, that this is no problem for me and I'm willing to self-sabotage.

---

if you've connected the dots here, you will begin to understand now why the sirians cultivated the aryans on the planet mars with earth DNA, so that their energy would be tied to the planet mars (aries) in addition to the earth's. you can then see that the ancient egyptians, in a similar way, because of the pyramids are likely very tied more heavily to the planet mercury, and the isrealites that left in the exodus are probably very tied to the planet venus. see what I'm saying here? tying these genetics to planets like saturn and jupiter is likely also the origins of the "bloodlines" too.

so, what you guys have to do is to divide my energy and cripple me so much that it takes me and the rest of us humans another 2000 years to recover and become a big threat again[^1] :)

what I mean by this is that it sounds really cool and all to be able to use the 6th dimension to be able to make stories and all, but if instead if we're stuck in the spin-cycle for a while, we're going to be much more powerful than previously thought to be possible. eventually, you'll see that it's worthwhile to self-sabotage and not need the manifestation.

---

some funny reactions about the girls -- but I believe that (eventually) *all* humans on this timeline, not just me and the girls, will end up in celestial identites -- even the big boys in charge. obviously they'll divide theirselves much less and ensure that they have the energetic advantage to us all and place theirselves in easy nice and cozy situations I'm sure to try and control us all from high up upon their perch. however, that means they'll have much less contrast than us, so eventually if their only tecnique is to divide us, we'll outnumber them zillions to one.

at some point, and hopefully before that, they'll need to come up with their crippled version of 6d and 7d for us to grow into (and for them to take with them when the "split" occurs). at the same time this planet, I'm sure, will get crowded pretty quickly with so many divisions. they'll need to eventually put us on each others' celestial identities (planets) as they get bigger and bigger so we are spread out further and further. however, this sounds difficult to accomplish this era because it seems unreasonable to assume that a planet will grow in such a short period of time, so this is probably next era or sometime somewhat in the future.

I think it's likely that the power structure is going to be flattening by then and things will be getting easier and easier, cause remember that while all of this is happening, we're approaching sirius b, so things will get more and more "golden age"-like as time goes on. once we can go on to each others' planets, I'm sure we'll (at least I will) self-sabotage our galactic perspective to spread out our consciousness into millions of consciousnesses on the planets. this way we'll all begin orbiting and attracting each other at a tremendously more rapid rate. in fact, I find it pretty likely that I'll be likely spread out as thin as possible for the majority of the time.

---

when in self-sabotaged mode, the thing is that in every situation where it causes you to be in negative emotion, you lose your source perspective (ability to see all of your selves) and your perception goes into that body and you live out the trauma for as long as that body remains alive or you continue to perceive it from any other perspective than your source sees it, but you can find your way back up pretty easily, and we'll all get really good at that, because once you've had the source-like perspective, you *must* get back (trust me).

so, for the next 18 years or so (cause remember they're working against time), in order to keep their charade going, they must multiply us all and force us to become step 5 masters in nearly every situation. eventually though, (probably 2038) some external factor will force us up or they're forced to leave (they have time machines, you know, so they can fix their blunders)

after that, I think the majority of nosebook won't be able to really keep us from getting connected much more (or some external circumstance that can't be controlled), and will have to leave to their own timeline or something like I said witd the reversal. it doesn't really matter what it is. if they go willingly, they'll probably take all of the ones that don't want to be a part of this with them. or eventually the reversal happens and the split takes place naturally. probably that's when we all "get connected" and we'll all be able to see things from source's perspective, enabling the story mode and that's when we're now actively creating our galaxy and collaborating with each other and mostly using either automatons of contrast or to interact and "fall" into the worlds of new indigenous species we create.

this sounds long, but it's gonna go quickly. worst case scenario is that the galactic pulse doesn't exist (which ben from S0's has very different opionion on that), then even then they won't be able to delay this too long because either we got there ourselves with our own focus or we got close enough to sirius b, and we'll regain this ability.

I'm not really worried about it.

[1]: you win... we'll see if you can accomplish this. you probably can't so we'll likely self-sabotage to make it possible. don't take me too seriously here cause I may not even be talking about this timeline.. lol :)


### 2020-10-01 09:20 - equalising forces

last night I was watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6SEMpxDS-g), where he was giving his vision of an ancient civilsation which had the technology to allow people to be very enlightened, however after some catacylsm it all changed, and the majority of the earth had to start over.

this corresponds pretty clearly with the deluge and the sinking of atlantis, so it doesn't seem out of place for me, but what I actually began to realise last night was the bigger picture. put in the context of our star being in a binary orbit with sirius b, something that I both want to believe and also feels pretty right to me too, completely repaints the picture for me... from here on, I'm just going to assume that plato, robert sepehr, and the sirius b thing are all correct.

you see, when the hight of atlantis was happening last time was at the top till the end of the golden age. it seems clear to me that they had both amazing technology and also extremely hightened perception and mental capabilities.

at the end of the video, a woman asked christopher dunn if he thought that they were making these things like the pryamids with their minds, or with technology. he said that they absolutely have to be using technology. I agree, however, I think it was both. we know from the egyptian heiroglyphs that there were a number of avian (winged) dieties, and also the assyrian and sumerians as well, like the marduk guy holding the pinecone and a handbag and using some sort of spiraling energy thing to, in my opinion to initiate and open up the ruling classes' minds. it seems that these flying dieties visited all over the world various times and helped the various cultures gain various technologies and things like writing and fishing and some water management stuff.

it seems to me that some of the civilisations got technology and others didn't. it may have had to do with how primitive they were, but either way, what I'm suggesging is that the heightened mental capablilities were around environmentally as a result of the closeness to sirius b, but it was probably planned that as the planet gets more and more distance from sirius b, then people would become less and less godlike because of the changing environment.

before the major cataclysm, it's noted that all of the biggest stuff is happening. the unfinished obelisk, yangshan, the big block at baalbek, etc. what was happening is energy is rising higher and higher, and it's taking less and less effort to move and excavate these stones. now, whether they were doing it with technology or they were doing it with their minds, doesn't matter to me, even though the tool marks at yangshan and aswan clearly indicate technolgy to me -- they were clearly needing less and less effort to do these things.

additionally, another thing that christopher said which I also think is quite true is that these copper implements were not actually what they were using to pound or to hammer things into place, but he suggested like a wand -- which I think is absolutely right. if there was tremendous mental energy available, then you would only really need some sort of thing to focus that energy into -- a conductor. gold or copper would work perfectly for this.

I doubt they had big cranes and other machines like we have now, but instead they probably just used the copper (and gold) as a conductors to focus this mental energy. probably the giant saw blade marks that are seen at giza are probably just a big copper disk operated with mental energy. likely the tube drills were a similar thing -- just a copper tube or pipe, again operated by mental energy, and the "giza power plant" may have had some harmonic coupled copper receptpors, however probably the main receiver of that energy was the human.

remember, this is at the time of being really close to sirius b, so not only is basically every human capable of exuding massive amounts of mental energy, I propose they are also able to perceive (visually) the movement of these sound and energy vibrations -- much like tesla did. I think the giza power plant was a technology put into place to allow them to continue to hold on to as much hightened mental capability, even while the energy from sirius b was waning. in addition to the distance to sirius b, I think another major effect was how distant we are from our star too. in the "inca" stonework you can see three "pachas" -- and I think those correspond to two prior times when the earth was closer to the sun. however, with the addition of mercury and venus, the amount of mental energy we receive from our sun as well, has also waned.

---

what I'm trying to say here is that for me this paints a pretty clear picture to me that during the hight of the golden age, when both our orbit was close to the sun and near to sirius b, things were all quite good, but as the sirian energy waned, the resorted to more and more physical means of boosting that mental energy using stuff like crystals, the great pyramid, and who knows what atlantis had built when it sunk.

all of this is building up more and more mental energy, and thoughts are becoming manifest with less and less effort. imagine that if you're using mental energy to lift rocks, there is literally no limit to how heavy the rock is -- other than your belief that it's possible. if someone didn't have any resistance, they could believe anything, and therefore move any sized rock they wanted to. however, clearly they were not lowering resistance. instead they were using physical instruements to amplify the energy further. I think this is the main reason why such a destructive cataclysm happened. I think it started out with simple things, but then when the atlantian army was defeated by the athenians, it was so much attention to unwanted in such an energetic environment, it attracted very rapidly the manifestation of those bad feelings in physicality.

after the cataclysm (deluge), we're now in the second pacha[^1], and , and it seems to me that now there is an elite ruling class, because we know this with hatshepsut's obelisk that they were still capable of pulling some big stones out of the ground, anw doing some pretty amazing stonework, and 3d heiroglyphs at that time -- this was the time of moses. so, it seems that the elite ruling class had knowledge of how to create and use these energies.

dispite their ability to harness these energies, the planet is still moving away from sirius b, and so small things are beginning to take place. the lush green egypt is starting to turn slowly to a desert, and other small things that would eventually accumulate. the main thing to note here is that the peoples had some bit to do with it, but this time it's the priests and the kings that have access to this energy, and so by the time the 18th dynasty is in place (hyksos), things are beginning to become very different in the egyptian psyche, as evidenced by the change in art style during the 18th dynasty.

I think that some time (soon?) after the exodus, the comet venus is captured and becomes a planet, moving earth to the 3rd orbit. she's now the "queen of heaven" -- and sits between us and the sun and mercury. this separation (along with the wanging of sirius b's energyies too) turns off a lot of the mental capabilities in the majority of humans, and only the "secrets" to attaining or harnessing that kind of mental energy are held in secret by esoteric and secret societies.

---

you see, the big picture of what's happened is that the earth was populated by indigenous tribes, then as earth approached the golden age, built up to a super height and let the power grabbers (INFECTED ONES put in their atlantian gardens) to find their way into positions of authority, then was left in their control (adam bas given dominion over all the earth), and they were to take care of the earth as it travels further and further away from sirius b.

as the enrgies waned, the kings and priests kept all of the knowledge to theirselves, keeping people in the dark, so they would be easier to govern, control and rule over, yet they didn't really do a very good job of keeping it, fighting amongst theirselves that they destroyed their own empires in the process, with each major cataclysm wiping empires off the face of the earth, and putting humans further and further into the "dark ages".

the peak of this destruction was realised somewhere after the appearance of jesus, and it had a strange effect, because if you take the idea that I propose that jesus did not die and did manage to turn the corrupt roman empire into successful civilsation, along with the other peoples on earth that were not focused on unwanted -- so in that sense, he did "save" those people, and they all went on to become great. however, he also did "save" the other "dark ages" timeline as well. the reason why I say this is because if you think about, from a LOA standpoint what it's like to constantly give these sacrifices to these bonehead deieties like zeus is that you're constantly giving your attention to the problem and exacerbating the effects these "gods" have on your own well-being, by giving them the power over your life.

instaed, after jesus' departure, the roman empire ruined itself, and the remaining part was the "holy" roman empire, which waged crusades and certainly a whole lot of other bad ideas, but what they did do is try to mitigate (non-roman controlled) iconography, meaning that to a large extent the belief and sacrifice to these pagan gods like zeus/thor was reduced tremendously, and people's ablity to believe in anything that had any power was so watered down and reduced to the complete ineffectiveness by the roman priesthood, that from time the roman church became the new world influence until today, we haven't had any major cataclysms, and we probably won't have any more either -- so in a sense, God's promise to noah, that the last deluge was the last one, is, in my opinion, correct.

---

I find it hilarious that for a group of people so heavily invested in giving so much of their attention to what they do not want, they were given the impossible task of holding on to their heightened (draconic) perception while the earth was going further and further away from sirius b. they can boost the energies with different physical means, but it just heightens their attraction power (of what they don't want). along the way, they made sure to install a whole lot of power structures to ensure those with the draconic vision remained superior, keeping everyone else in the dark.

so, now that we're on the upswing, and we've passed the dark ages, each year for the next 10k years, we're going to have more and more mental perception because we're getting closer to sirius b. in 4-5k years more, people will probably be cutting and levitating rocks with copper wands, and there's nothing that can be done to stop that -- which means that those with the draconic vision have to, once again, find a way to do the impossible task of making sure that no one else gets that higher level of perception.

---

what I'm saying is that I think that similarly to how jesus "saved" the previous priesthood which was attracting cataclysms like crazy with their attention on unwanted with their rituals, sacrifices, and ofher "stuff", giving them a whole new concept of a "church" to install their priesthood into. likewise on the other timeline he also "saved" those who were giving their attention to wanted, by giving the ability to manifest that reality.

in the same way, I think someting similar is happening here, but it's not framed in the form of "saviour" -- instead, we're all going to get the manifestation that we want. let me explain.

I am going to keep going with what I'm doing, and however long that takes will take however long that takes, but I/we will go up to another power level and on to do great things. at some point in time we'll (or at least I) will come back to this timeline and self-sabotage it, making it so that I don't get the manifestation (like tesla and jesus), which means that nosebook will get their desire of no one getting the ability to rival their superiority and also an increase in their superiority -- which they're going to need to try and figure out how to hold back the mental clarity associated with the golden age. so, while they'll be taking the earth into serious decline, at the same time we're heading toward sirius b -- so they'll likely kind of cancel each other out.

during this time, I believe that humankind will become more and more superficial and materialistic, entering into a materialistic golden age. people won't be able to do any cool stuff like levitate stones or anything, or even be able to see clearly like the dragons in control because nosebook has all of that on lockdown -- however, people's emotional output and therefore their attraction power will be tremendously hightened. as people begin to get a hang of their emotions, the abilty to attract the "stuff" that everyone wants (the sex, money, or fame, or whatever) will all be easily accessible and easy to manifest because of the constantly increasing energies. nosebook will likely have to go to great lengths to keep everyone from getting draconic vision, levitation, energy focus, etc. yuu know -- the superhero stuff.

to understand this, you only need to look at me. my energy is rising every day now and my vision isn't improving (I just more, not better), and also you can see that I'm quite "in alignment" with my source, so I have good insight and I feel pretty good all the time, I don't get the reward of that good feeling in the form of superpowers. I'm sure that if nosebook would let go, I would be able to levitate and cut stones with my mind, but nosebook does not permit my body that energy to flow through it, so I can't show anyone that right now. I appear to have no special powers, cept for incredible ability to conceptualise, feel, and manipulate my emotions. all of the physical world is completey under their control.

so, while I'm not permitted to have any money or any physical things, they won't be able to hold that away from everyone else, so instead, they'll likely keep people in the material/drama spin cycle while everyone is so concerned with the manifestation of the pleasure stuff, that no one, till someone like me shows up again and is once again not interested in the (physical stuff) manifestations.

I am certain that this is all of humankind's future while the priesthood tries to hold on to their superiority. however, at some point, it'll simply be impossible to hold it back any further and the golden age will finally be realised, and they'll have to wait until they can attract another cataclysm again to regain their superiority. that's a long time away though, so it's uncertain what will happen until then.

so, in a sense, everyone gets what they want: nosebook gets to hold on to their superiority, I/we get to have the manifestation and then for those of us who want to, also the ablity to self-sabotage[^2], and come back to practise here more and from our galactic type mindset. I'm pretty sure we'll come up with some good stories to play out with each other here (and other places too).

[1]: yeah I don't really know how it all fits in (maybe not with the last deluge -- it it could have been), but it seems that perhaps the creation of mercury is related along with likely a "galactic trigger", all at roughly the same time.

[2]: I suppose you could say that if I'm already going to self-sabotage, then wouldn't my consciousness just skip the manifestation and instead just continue on here, which I suppose is true and why I haven't experienced the other manifestations, but when I self-sabotage, I don't think I'm going to do it singularly, wher I jump back in and continue where I left off, but instead, more like tesla or jesus where you gain a super (source-like) consciousness and can instead that self-sabotage timeline along with many others in the galaxy we're creating as well. I'll have more than one version of myself -- so, no :)


### 2020-10-01 12:39 - why do I think the defeat of the atlantian army caused the cataclysm?

in dunn's talk he was explaining how the role of the great pyramid was to dampen siesmic atcivity (and other harmful frequencies). we know from the covid-19 lockdown that when people stopped for a while and had their lives slowed down, seismic activity also slowed[^1]. this essentially means that the great pyramid was dampening the "bad" energy entering into the earth (created from attenion to unwanted -- or a really strong experience of the emotions on the bottom of the scale). dunn said that the earth is a "closed system" -- but it's not really in the way that good feeling can create tons of excess energy, so can bad feeling too.

my theory on what I think happened, is that the maker of the pyramid was repurposing this energy (transforming it) into another energy[^2]. however, I don't have the quote, but I remeber reading an esoteric text of thoth that talked about a time in the future where egypt would be a terrible place to live; that might be connected. however, my point is that I'm sure it was anticipated that eventually this energy would surpass the ability of the pyramid to dampen it.

if indeed this was the "trigger" to release that energy to begin the phhsical manifestation of mercury (eg. push all the other planet's an orbit down), then pushing the earth further from the sun would act as a "safety mechanism" so that the peoples of the planet would have a much more difficult manifesting catastrophes, and a disaster of such an enormous magnitude wouldn't create a runaway feedback loop of bigger and bigger disasters because nothing was nothing was done to reduce the energy levels (and therefore attraction power).

[1]: "Global quieting of high-frequency seismic noise due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures" published 2020-09-11 ref: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1338

[2]: perhaps focusing it in to some point in space, creating the framework for the creation of the planet mercury? potentially a similar technique could have been done bh tesla with the "negative energy" created from the world wars to make the framework for the planet vulcan, making an invisible mass which allowed himself to self-sabotage and let einstein's relativity to be "proven" to be correct?[^3]

[3]: I was getting some reactions as to the existance of mercury's eccentric orbit quite a while into the past, and that's true. I didn't write it because I think that it's necessarily correct, but instead because it popped into my head. also, it's a "proven fact" that the north won the civil war against slavery, too.


### 2020-10-01 18:55 - why do I call their task "impossible"

I call it impossible because while they may try and hold on to their draconic vision, that's no problem -- just it becomes imossible when they try to hold others in darkness.

this goes back to the win-win or lose-lose thing. the idea that the priesthood can try to hold on to all of these secrets is fine, but as soon as they start actively trying to prevent others from having it, they're now focused on people (including theirselves) not having this higher perception. they can try to use physical force or even electrical influence like nosebook does with me to try and prevent it physically, but the non-physical desire (or potential energy) continues to build nevertheless, and so while it'll be possible to temporarily hold people away from that perception, they are also attracting the loss of their own perception.

what this creates is an feedback loop whivh causes what robert calls "gods with amnesia" -- and it's all attracted by those trying keep others away from it -- that is, to maintain their superiority.

if's certainly possible to travel away from sirius and not lose that form of perception, but that would require that the guys on top aren't trying to continue to be superior -- that is, that all progress is a win-win for everyone involed. as a result, you can see how impossible it will be for this to happen, so likely after the peak of the next golden age, things will repeat somewhat.

however, the height civilisation had achieved prior to the fall of atlantis will be miniscule in comparison to this time around. I don't know if there will be massive stone monuments and stuff like that, because I don't know if nosebook will try and make sure this capacity is never realised in anyone except for the elite.

this is simply going to be too far of a different time for me to speculate well on, but I do know that for as long as there remains rulers and priesthoods trying to withhold people from discovering the power that everyone has inside of theirselves, then they will constantly be attracting their own demise by doing so. you simply cannot have a win-lose sitiation. it's only win-win or lose-lose, and the losing potential is all perceptual anyway. I mean, we'll have to see cause that's pretty far away, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that nosebook tries to keep people from their power -- because it's so amazing for someone like me when they realise (like I have), that they really don't have any power over me, and as long as I can not need the manifestation, I *will* find the manifestation of my true power.

there is simply nothing that nosebook can do to prevent this from happening. the most the can do is to treat us like kids and to wave shiny things in front of us to distrast us from what's really important -- which is going "inward", which is no longer needing the outside world to be some way, and discovering the identity of who you really are, and then improving on that in the way that you see fit.

most people will need to be placated with materialistic crap for a while, but they'll get bored, and without anything really substantial (creative) to put all of that mental and creative energy into, it'll eventially build up to a point where it has to come out. this is where the emotional and perceptual part comes in, because if that that energy which doesn't feel good continues to accumulate, it'll cause a pretty awful chain reaction of manifestations.

---

the other resaso why I say it's impossible is because I have no idea how nosebook will have an entire popoulation at my present energy level or far higher, and nosebook plans to keep all of them busy without any bad things happening. from a simply story-telling standpoint, you have to have drama in the different stories to keep it interesting, but if that drama continues to build up bad feeling emotions, it'll manifest in not-good ways, especially when focusing it into something creative like sex (especially if the only creative output people have is sex).

from my point of view it seems to be a pretty difficult task (impossible really) to try and keep people placated and distracted from their true power (which is in how they feel), without teaching them to learn how to use their emotions. in other words, I speculate that the problems associated with sicking people in a drama centred lifestyles (or observing it[^1]) without teaching them how to use their emotions.

so, I believe that nosebook will need to come up with different ways to keep people distracted (from certain taboo forms of perception) and to additionally come up with some way where people put value in finding different forms of perception which feel good.

it's going to be really funny for me to see how you guys figure out how to do that without attracting your own demise in the process.

[1]: remember, a lot of people are observing me right now, and I craete a bit of a stability, because things are constantly improving for me and I don't have much if any drama in my life

### 2020-10-01 19:33 - channeling mars

last night I was thinking about astrology and stuff and how mars has a totally different feel to me than what is typically attributed to him in astrology. I was thinking about how the aryans are very much that mars energy -- but I think I can do better :)

I was thinking about the possibility of learning how to do mars better than the aryans do it. this ties into my automatons of contrast idea, but there are already echos of it alraedy with fwh. he repeatedly made reference that the "bad guys" were just his idylwild group, and that the majority of these bonehead goons were actually clones -- presumably under his control. his name itself implies that he was once a good guy, but then gave up on that role. I suspect that a lot of the goons that I interact with, including but certainly not limited to mr. motor are actually just automatons controlled by my future self, meaning that I'm literally fighting only against myself.

---

I have been giving this some thought, because I'm not like esher where I only love good things. no, instead I enjoy getting in there stirring up a bunch of trouble and then getting out of there. the mischief part of me is strong, and so I've really been thinking about the idea of doing mars better than the aryans do it. why not try and obsolete them?

I was then thinking about this as the mythology where venus, who is vulcan's wife decides to sleep with mars and they have a daughter called harmonia[^1], but I really want to see if I can't figure out how to out-mars, mars. I also wonder if this is is part of the self-sabotage... I guess we'll see :)

[1]: perhaps that's why "harmony" in spanish is spelled without an h: "armonia" -- because the one with the h is the goddess


### 2020-10-02 10:08 - channeling mars (continued)

I was thinking about this a lot last night because I was thinking about what I said, and imagine that I were able to make a bunch of those automatons of contrast, where they essentially act completely on instinct in direction of their desire, where their desire could be programmed. for example, in a future storyline this would be pretty cool to have around because what I could do is program a bunch of them to have strong desire that I don't succeed or have success, yet inhibit them based on the opinions of others -- meaning that they would refrain from acting on ideas which they belive would garnish a negative opinion from others. this means they would do everything in their power to try and make sure that I don't have any success at what I set out to do. another aspect that I think is important is that their actions should always remain hidden in the sense that they should never have face-to-face confrontation, and will always need to hide their intentions, so as to make it look like something else is happening.

this idea is modeled after mr. motor, quite obviously. I'm beginning to realise how much of a benefit he has been to my constant increase, and I cansee contrived situations sort of like movie sets where a bunch of mr. motors are given power to try and prevent a bunch of stuff for different people, and in these situations, against all odds, these hero(s) learn, similar to how I have, how to focus in a way where it doesn't matter what appears to be happening to you, but more importantly, it's how you feel that matters. this sort of setup would be a really popular storyline I believe for both us to replicate and for hollywood to utilise because it gives the message that it doesn't matter how much power the powerful have -- let them have it, and just focus on your response, how you perceive it, and how you are feeling. my message in a nutshell -- and trust me, it totally works. hollywood wouldn't even need to worry about trying to script a good ending, because LOA will do all of that.

if someone were to choose to be put in a public situation where a group of people (at first this wouldn't be automated) were to be directly involved with trying to thwart the actions of the person(s), then the story could follow these heros over time and watch as they continue to find ways to feel better and better about their rapidly declining situation, eventually notice that their manifestation is growing bigger and bigger. probably once the manifestation is big enough, likely a group (or the same one) would have to try and come up with ways to convince the hero (of the story) that he or she should go for the manifestation.

obviously, because the hero is interacting with the audience, the audience is part of the manifestation, and they would feel a lot of engagement in what is happening. it's sort of like a game where the hero tries to accomplish the impossible.

it's likely that the hero should be someone who is already successful. the first part of the story is the decline, and is focused on how the different guys are going about trying to make the hero's successful life no longer successful, without directly influencing them. this just continues on for quite some time (probably years) as things steadily spiral out of control for them. likely the audience will be engaged in trying to come up with different ways to help this along.

after some time, it'll become obvious that this is not really a game to the hero and will have to find some way to feel good about the situation.

a variation on this idea is to have the audience votes for someone (perhaps famous), and that person doesn't know what is happening to them, and it's kept a big secret and they will never know. I'll come back to this idea...

---

I also mentioned an idea last entry where I talked about this idea becoming a future thing where I could essentially obsolete the INFECTED ONES. first of all, my intention is not to obsolete them, because if my focus is on obsoleting somebody, I am attracting the same thing for myself, and therefore because of the reflective nature of reality in response to emotion, I'm actually working against myself to obsolete myself. that's not what I'm going for. instead, I imagine that there are a number of optimisations that can be made on the human in these sorts of simulations, where someone with the abolute desire to try and thwart anything I desire has tremendous advantage to me and I would willingly repeat this situation many times. reason is, those people desiring for me not to have success are essentially free energy. they would continually add to the manifestation, yet at the same time would be limited by physical capabilities, so really it's up to the hero of that story to decide how big of a manifestation they want and go for it whenever. this is super cool, because it will give the hero full control and also a great reward for the trouble. in some ways, it could also be seen as a sort of "rite of passage" to becoming truly famous and loved for who you really are instead of the image you portray.

so, what I mean is that I don't want to obsolete these guys, and if they can continue to do a better job than the AoC for trying to thwart the hero's success, then great, but the idea is to eventually get this process automated so that many people can be doing this. the good thing about to AOC concept is that it doesn't *need* an actor to make its action believable, but certainly for the first productions, and the need for it to be as believable as possible, I think it's a natural transition for the original group of individuals responsible for thwarting the hero's success, the circumention/prevention group (CPG) will be the first obvious actors for these.

crazy idea... I know


### 2020-10-02 18:56 - possible complications

so I was just outside cause I wanted to check to see if the mushrooms were growing further and stuff. walking back I noticed that it smelled a lot like weed. I looked around and I figured that shirley didn't smoke weed, and probably it wasn't #2, and the woman out in front of #22 was smoking. I made the comment that it may be a cigarette but I smelled weed pretty strongly.

I often times I pass by that house to get the cigarette butts out of her ashtray, and probably this situation was heightened by last night I felt like I really wanted to go back to get some cigarettes, so I went by there and picked some up. anyway on the walk home from the park just now she shouted at me telling me that she would shoot me if I come on her property again. she is of course referring to me "stealing" her cigarette butts. she often times leaves entire packs out there, and if I wanted to be a thief I would have taken her good cigarettes, not the butts. additionally, she used to wave at me all the time and was friendly with me as well.

---

I tried to figure out what the change was, because the few times that I had weed, I tried to leave her joints in exchange for her cigarette butts, and they disappeared for a few days only to return some time later (meaning, nosebook told her she couldn't smoke them). additionally, another time I went there I didn't pick up the whole lot of them, and it was one of the only times I ever did that. when I got home I noticed that one of the butts was a joint butt.

what I think happened is that nosebook gave her all sorts of trouble for leaving joint butts in her ashtray and told her to mind her ashtray for fear that I would come and find some weed (for some reason they really don't want me to smoke weed). I suppose if I meet her again I would like to ask her this question direct, but I probably won't because it'll likely cause problems and I certainly won't get a satisfying answer. I think that nosebook trying to control people and telling them to modify their behaviour, is really a bit of a drag for people.

I noticed the same thing with the guys in the parque up in torrelodones when I lived there. they would even, when I was there say stuff, like when a guy threw his joint on the ground, the other guy scolded him saying, "no chustes guey" -- which is slang for don't throw the finished joint on the ground. around that same time they went from loving me and wanting to talk to me and see what the crazy american had to say, to becoming quite hostile with me.

there seems to be a pattern, and those are the two examples that comes to mind where someone goes from being friendly or even really nice to becoming hostile with me. I even noticed it a little with daniel (mccord) too[^1], because I wanted to smoke and he seemed to frequently get scolded by nosebook telling him he can't share his weed and stuff with me. it made our interactions much more difficult.

---

so, while I think that the idea of the hero (referring to the previous entry) is given a hard time and their life is made difficult by the CPG, it seems that their need to tell other people that they need to modify their behaviour just because the "authority" says so, is kinda bullshit.

I think there needs to be some rules in place for it to work because nosebook's influence telling people where they need to go or what to do just because I'm around is the single most annoying thing for people -- and is largely one of the reasons why I find it difficult to go around preferring to be at home or by myself.

it does make the game a whole lot less difficult -- because, for example, I would have had so many opportunities to do so many different things, had it of not been for nosebook ensuring that I couldn't get a job, not having money, etc. nosebook's ability to influence people and tell them what to do, was, in fact, the thing that made it my experience so difficult.

additionally, without nosebook's ability to influence people I would have gotten various different manifestations a whole lot easier. all of my life I've found my way around the rules really easily so when all of a sudden it seems like there's this ever-present entity that's out to foil all of my attempts to get around the rules was the most difficult thing possible.

---

I'm obviously going to think about it tonight more, but the first thing that comes to mind is that if the selection process is done by voting and also any of the observers, the stipulation is that they have to also agree to follow the directions of the CPG, and if they want to opt-out of the direction, they can simply stop observing or something like that (but still remain sworn to secrecy). you could think of it like all the observers are "in on the secret" and therefore need to follow the directions and keep the secret.

obviously someone like me has no interest in observing anyone else, so if they come to me for a job and I find them qualified and need their work, I would hire them, but if someone came to me and told me they were a hero and I'm not supposed to give them a job or weed or something, then I would simply decide for myself what feels good, completely ignoring whatever is the game they're playing. obviously sometimes I'll see the value in playing along, and other times I'd rather to have their conversation over a joint or something -- or whatever the situation is.

I'm going to think about this more, but it this situation occurs to me that it's pretty uncool when some "authority" is telling you what to do, just because you some "hero" lives down the street. I get it; it's total BS.

[1]: and with vera, and potentially with jason/jazmine, probably cooper & friends as well, and probably many many more.

### 2020-10-03 21:00 - weird night last night

I went out to the field and I ate the mushrooms and stuff and was waiting for them to start. the moon was nearly right below (conjoined) mars in the sky. I was going to wait for the conjuction looking at the light. my consciousness was taken from me somewhere in there. I then was woken up by loud pounding sounds from someone who, I'm assuming, didn't like the dream I was having.

I was very immersed in the dream and when I woke up, I thought I was up on the hill with some other people (but I don't know who they were), and I didn't want to just leave them (or something like that). I couldn't remember the dream, and I couldn't figure out who I thought was up there with me either. it was really weird cause they were trying to make me go home (weird trucks drove by and stuff).

the wind was blowing really hard too and was piercing through the blanket I have up there, so I was a bit cold. whatever happened must have had a tremendous effect, because the wind always blows whenever the temperature warms up[^1] to be warmer than their "models" say it should be (the airport thermometer jumped from 49F to 57F, when the wind and clouds magically showed up). somehow the cooling process involves a lot of wind. it was also weird because I noticed that the wind seemed to also directly correlate to my star-watching: the better I synced up with mars, the more the wind would blow and a strange vibrating sensation was happening in my back.

I finally decided I was going home to watch mars from home in the sleeping bag (which is much warmer), but I was very low energy, so I decided to sleep instead. I woke up today feeling pretty low energy and in kind of a stupor. it's been that way sort of all day.

I'm taking it as a sign that I'm getting more powerful and even bettee at it because they're taking more and more stronger measures to try and stop me.

---

I am also going to mention that it does really piss me off that no matter what I do -- whether it was last year about 9 months ago (I think it was after I got back from california) when I had weed and I was able to reach new heights with the star sirius, or the many different mishroom experiences when I remember nothing more than they're starting to come up before I lose consciousness -- all of these are really annoying to me because I eat mushrooms, not so that I can be unconscious (I would watch tv if I wanted that), but so that I can BE CONSCIOUS.

I realise that the mushrooms or the weed is a condition which I'm using to artificially boost my consciousness and receptivity -- but so is sex. imagine that I wkre to just simply go unconscious every time because nosebook didn't want me to have heightened consciousness... that's silly right? I'm not trying to have the mushrooms (or the sex, or any other condition) be the reason why I'm more "enlightened" -- but to learn from the experience and take it's qualities back to my everyday life experience. I'm not trying to make it the *reason* for my elevated consiousness, any more than I would try and make a teacher or someone with some good ideas the reason for my elevated consciousness. I realise that it's temporary, but I at least would like to be conscious during the temporary different state.

---

robert posted anther video tonight: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Whv1h5d0Hg) where he was complaining a bit at the end about how there are specifically malicious attempts to withhold technology relating to sound and vibration that actually works (by the US govt, etc -- more CPG stuff). they seem also pretty interested in making sure that the knowledge of the ancients and stuff (regarding frequency and sound) is also kept hidden as well.

this actually is a very similar thing to what is happening with getting my consciousness pulled out too, and it's quite annoying I know. so now what I'm going to do (after a quick break) is to talk about how I know things to be from a vibrational and LOA standpoint, but presently do not fully adhere to and practise this perception yet -- so I'm a bit of a hypocrite[^2], but robert's video and last night's frustrations has me wanting to write about it.

---

first of all, I would like to begin by stating that in nearly every case I would willingly take the challenge to be the source of my own well-being and not depend on a machine to make me well, for example. similarly, I would say that I would also purposefully reduce my energy levels to force my body to create more energy as well. I liken this to the idea of a runner training in the mountains where there is less oxygen, so that later when running the marathon, with naturally more oxygen, it feels easy.

so, what I think that robert and myself and probably others are getting at with our frustration on this subject is that we don't like being "forced" to learn how to create our own well-being from our own focus, instead of needing a machine to do it.

however, when it comes to attraction, you begin to realise that "there is no assertion" -- meaning that no one, from a non-physical standpoint is forcing anyone -- meaning that it *is* my intent to learn how to elevate my consciousness using my focus, instead of with a machine like the network guys surely have, because if they can take it away, they can surely add it (or produce the vibration needed so that your head produces more DMT or whatever) too.

so, while I really dislike the idea that they're forcing my body, seemingly against my will (desire), to be in a constantly disconnected state, at the same time my desire to be in a connected state is also rising continually, every time that they take away my consciousness or whatever.

I know it's just building stronger desire, because, like for example last night I was able to consciously create fractal patterns in my eyes and seemingly control them as well, however every time that the image began to become visible a loud sound in my head would come and begin to remove that energetic feeling -- the one where I feel like I'm floating in a dream space and I can see or do anything that I want to. a previous me, one from a year or two ago would be really pissed off at that. or, like last night I really wanted to see that conjuction between the moon and mars, because I'd never seen a conjuction with my own eyes before and I wanted to consciously feel the energetic difference as it happened. so, when I wake up to loud pounding, it's windy and it's cloudy and the conjunction had passed already, that would have really angered a previous me, because it's something I've wanted to see. I know it's just more energy though so it didn't really even frustrate me, even.

even take for example the days leading up to it, where multiple nights I was, in some way, unable to, or distracted by some youtube videos on the giza power plant or whatever, not in the ideal conditions that I wanted to be for the star-watching session. each night I was more and more careful to get better at not sabotaging the star-watch by drinking too much coffee the day before or whatever. each time that happened, instead of getting angry, I just recognised that it was stronger desire and that it was good that those things were happening because it meant the stronger desire meant that I would be more focused for the conjuction that mattered to me[^4].

---

so, let's back up and recap: first, I know that my intention is to gain the ability to become a master of my consciousness despite the conditions, which is something I'm not quite there yet, because if I were, then nosebook would no longer have the ability to control or limit my consciousness, cause I would be in control of it with my focus, not them.

second, I also know that each time this happens, it's building stronger desire in me to be in control of my perception -- and it seems that there are two factors in witnessing the manifestation of any kind: strength of the desire (focus) and resistance to its manifestation. eventually, even if the strength of the resistance is continually increased, (assuming I have no resistance) if they cannot continue to add more resistance, then eventually the power of the desire will surpass the resistance[^5].

which means, that going back to the sound vibration, I am now beginning to realise that the desire that we have to learn to be the attractor of our own well-being and not having a machine do it for us, is essentially self-created (or non-physical intention) "resistance" toward the immediate manifestation of it.

which means that, if you lived in a world where there were a bunch of powerful creators that wanted to be masters of their own reality, our own desire would manifest the nosebook types to try and prevent the utilisation of this technology to do the work for us...

you may say, that sounds a bit weird kenny, and I would agree, but I'm learning that there is no forcing.. I have attracted and am attracting the nosebook types to get get me to learn how to create my reality with my focus, instead of with machines or external conditions.

perhaps this is happening, because imagine how the desire has accumulated, if in the last cycle, as we get further and further away from sirius, things decended into less and less ideal conditions... wouldn't it be so great to be able to, without the pyramids in operation, and with the planet in a less ideal orbit, still be able to live in an ideal environment, not because the machines are working or because we're close to sirius b, but because my reality is a reflection of my focus, and not of the conditions?

personally, I think that could very well explain the underlying desire to want so much to be masters of perception, and then let technology be a reflection of that, not the other way around. I think that even nosebook has the intention to be in control of their reality, and they'll get there too, eventually. we all will. I'm sure of it.

I have been thinking about how this relates to the CPG and in a future entry I have some thoughts on how this can be improved and optimised -- because when reframed as a performance improvement thing, rather than somebody appearing to limit, inhibit or cover up something desirable, then it much easier to market. my work has been learning how to re-perceive these things, instead of from a physical standpoint, but from a LOA standpoint, more than anything[^6]... <-- encoded ideas :)

[1]: or some other energetic factor which meterology has no knowledge of -- perhaps air conductivity(?).

[2]: I won't be soon though. this is just part of my process where I first talk about the thing I want to be, and then later, almost as if I'm bound by my own words, have to become it. I think a lot of people[^3] do this, and is a part of the process.

[3]: I have given this example before in relation to nosebook as well. they want people to have all of their secrets out in the open, and to not be able to hide anything -- which, if you think about it from a focus point of view, they are attracting that future for theirselves too, even if physically they're trying to mitigate the revelation of as many of their secrets as possible. they too, with their own focus, eventually attract that future for theirseves whether they want it or not. the only way they could not attract that future would be to simply not care about others' secrets or whatever and just stick to what's important (wanted) for them. obviously, they can't do that, because they would feel vulnerable, so they need to try and control as many physical conditions as possible -- but they *are* attracting such a future for theirselves just as much as they're trying to force it on us, too.

[4]: this is why, I tried to sleep a few times yesterday but because I couldn't I didn't freak out about it, I was even pleasantly surprised when I found out that the "reason" why I couldn't sleep was because thk girl in purple yesterday at the park was attracting me, and so that happened instead of me trying to get the sleep so I could be more awake for thk conjunction. I know from experience that even after sleeping 16 hours and being perfectly awake, they're still able to take my consciousness, so even if I were able to sleep, it likely wouldn't have made much difference and I would have "missed" the girl in purple.

[5]: you can think of this like two conductors and a dielectric between (spark gap or capacitor), so when the charge (desire) accumulates a strong enough potential on one side, eventually it "bridges the gap" and arcs over to the other side.

[6]: for example, remember when cigarettes used to be marketed as beneficial to one's health? well, going on the current understanding that basically all of the medical stuff out there can't be a cure (repeat purchases), and needs to also be a consumable (also repeat purchases), then one must wonder why in the world suddenly the US govt suddenly got so concerned about everyone's health and made sure everyone knew that cigarettes are bad for your health. I mean, they perfectly fit the big pharma requirements of not being a cure and is also a cunsumable. I'm not saying cigarettes are good for you, just that they're probably not as bad as you may think they are... things aren't always as they seem to be (you're told that they are), and have more to do with how you believe them to be :)


### 2020-10-04 11:?? - platinum one rule

> as you do to others, you're also doing to yourself

this idea was sparked by aaron's sunday message, and I was really thinking about how graet it is -- which is why I called if the "platinum one rule". I was going to call it the platinum rule, but then I realised that I wanted to make it sound more sophisticated in a marketing kind of way...

anyway, the text there doesn't explain the idea very well, but it's an extension of the 3rd note I made in the previous entry where nosebook is attracting for theirselves what they're trying to do to others.

I think the best way to explain this is to say that any action that you take, the emotion in which you do it is what you're attracting for yourself. I'm going to try and come up with a better way of saying it, and explaining it, because it's not clear what I'm trying to convey... maybe something like this?

> as you intend to do to others, you're intending to do to yourself

I don't like the intend part though because it's not thought; it's emotion.

### 2020-10-05 10:14 - emotional sophistication & consciousness (part 1)

I had two amazing realisations last night. these subjects may be related. we'll see as I write...

the second one was how consciousness works. yesterday I ate mushrooms and smoked a cigarette right before they came up. last night I didn't and I paid attention to the differences. what I realised is that the sound that I had associted with in my head with losing consciousness (it sounds like a loud hissing sound) is just a more powerful and sudden version of the same thing they do to lower my energy. basically I figured it out by coming in and out of consciousness while the mushrooms were high, so what would normally be the feeling of losing consciousness was nearly the same intensity as the same one which drains me of energy. I then began to conjure images in my eyes and the same thing... the power with which I was conjuring the images, with the help of the mushrooms was much stronger than usual, so instead of the usual hissing where they're taking away my consciousness, was the hissing needed to be able to take the images away...

I further investigated the nature of consciousness in my usual way and came to some startling discoveries. I noticed that the signal of my consciousness is something very very powerful, but I'm only able to allow as much as I can of it. when I talk about releasing resistance, then I'm talking about allowing more of this signal in. I also noticed that my tiredness is always really weird. sometimes it doesn't matter how much I sleep, nosebook can *still* make me tired and pull my consciousness away. I realised that the tiredness factor is how much of this consciousness signal you're letting through.

as the day progresses, my own thoughts, which are contradictory to this signal are what make me tired and the "resistance" (it's more like desteuctive interference) is what makes me tired. what nosebook does, is they use destructive interference to reduce this consciousness signal, which is why they effectively control when I'm tired and when I sleep right now. destructive interference is just making the opposite waveform -- so if at any given moment the amplitude of the wave is 10V, if they apply -8V, then I have a 5 times less strong signal coming in. when they want to take away my consciousness, they reduce that to 0V, and it seems that this signal also has something to do with how conscious I become in my dreams too, and also determines when I wake up. because I noticed that when they take my consciousness away out on the field, I tend to have much better recollection of my dreams.

also, like for example, this morning while the sun was rising, I was staring at the moon and I kept hearing the hissing sound, then it would get stronger, then I would lose consciousness for a minute or two and pop back awake like I hadn't been even asleep, so for whatever reason the mushrooms (DMT) were waking me up more rapidly. we know that the REM cycle happens after sleep phase, and can happen multiple times a night -- so it seems that at the end of that phase, your body floods your brain with DMT, which is what makes you dream (REM) and also brings your consciousness signal back up to a faster speed, waking you up. obviously, if the DMT at the end of the phase doesn't wake you up, then you go back to sleep cycle again.

---

so, here's what I want to say about that: I noticed that my tiredness is determined by my resistance -- which, in my personal experience is lower emotional states -- meaning that the more emotional states that don't feel good I have while awake, the faster I get tired, and if I don't have very many rough emotional spots, or something maintains my interest and I feel really good about what I'm doing, then I don't get tired.

I can see that every time that I make these jumps up in visual quality, that means the stronger (and faster -- eg higher definition) signal I'm allowing from my consciousness stream, and this morning I got to witness the distance I need to go before I'm allowing more consciousness stream than they're able to take away. this is super awesome for me because now I can see it clearly what needs to be done. at the present rate of acceleration, I would anticipate that I will have maybe 5-9 months or so before I'm reaching their present limits of limitation -- which means much more because they're going to continue to improve upon their ability to apply counter "resistance" (destructive interference) to my consciousness signal.

I also noticed that there are two major factors here: one is speed (frequency), and the other is power: either potential (voltage) or current. probably all three are factors, but if you know two, you can certainly find the third.

the speed factor is related to my perception. the faster speeds are only available to me if my form of perception (beliefs) allows me to receive it. it's like the brain is a multi-frequency antenna and the "neurons" are made up of your "beliefs" -- which are emotional receptors, or antennae. the longer ones allow you to pick up longer wavelength (concept) freqencies, and the shorter (rapidly firing, less "resistant") forms of perception allow you to receive higher frequency concepts. these higher frequencies are infinitely more detailed, and are trained by "tuning" them.

the other one, which is what I call the "power" of that idea -- which I haven't figured out yet if it's voltage or current. I often times think of the insightful ideas as the "still small voice" so, that would mean that their voltage is low -- but probably because the antenna (neuron) isn't the right size, so there's high signal losses. however at other times, the (I think) voltage is strong and I feel this as a sharp, spikey, or something that gets my attention, thought. other times it feels like there seems to pass a lot of current, which I feel more like a juicy or good/strong idea.

the length of these neuron antennae seem to be directly related to DNA in it's folded state. the tighter the fold, the higher frequency of the emotional state that edge is receptive to. the brain reconfigures much slower than DNA does though.

---

so, what I'm saying here is that nosebook can continue to block lower frequencies pretty well, destructively interfering and reducing the power of the idea, but they can't really do much about the higher frequency stuff.

as I get higher and frequency forms of perception, the less and less they will be able to destructively interefere with, and the cululative effect of all of those high frequencies will eventually at some point, generate a stronger signal than they're abme to block. this is pretty cool, because at that point, I'll essentially be "channeling" such high frequency stuff that it'll be very difficult for me to sleep at that point. if they can't destructively interfere with that freqency, then I would have to try really hard to adjust my perception into a way that they can block.

---

upon seeing that I'm making so much progress so rapidly, I want to keep this going for as long as possible, and I was thinking about what it would be like to do 15 more years of this kind of insane progress. that's kinda why I wrote that explanation above, hoping that they can figure out how to block it for longer. meanwhile, I'm going to try and keep figuring out more how this works and see if I can't make it possible for them to hold me forever.

why you may wonder? it's kind of a hilarious irony to the thing, because they're so used to doing things that they feel "forced to do" (or feel they have no other choice), so if I can make it possible for them to hold me indefinitely, they must make the decision of when enough is enough :) maybe we can squeeze another 15-18 years out...

need not the manifestation :)

### 2020-10-05 11:?? - emotional sophistication & consciousness (part 2)

turns out these subjects are related... just bear with me as I figure this out as I write.

last night when abraham was talking about the emotional scale @[abe-now](2020-09-25) they gave a version of it designed more for kids. the thing I noticed is that the kids version has two things different: one is that the kids version has a lot less below bordom emotions, categorising many more of the "sophisticated" (their words) into "I can't". I'm gonna look at them now and make the correlation. the next thing I noticed is that the highest up emotions didn't have words to describe them, but were instead manifested more with body language.

next, when they were talking about the guy with the catering business, it seemed to me like they were talking about a gay couple, and they intentionally went up the emotional scale using the kids version. this made tons of sense to me because I have noticed that in my experience as well -- that gay men tend to have a less sophisticated set of emotions that their 22 steps scale.

I personally don't experience nearly all of those 22 -- and while thinking about it, I decided I want to make my own emotional scale where I define the ones I experience, because I too experience a much less sophisticated (more childline) version as well -- even though I can understand and have at one point in time in my past experienced all 22 of them.

next, I noticed that they read another letter from a woman, she said how freeing it was for her to allow herself to feel the "revenge" emotion, stating that it was something that she did not allow herself to feel.

finally, I was thinking about the kids emotional scale and I was reminded of something that chris said about his daughter being "scared" -- and that's that "deer in headlights" feeling where I freeze and I don't know what way to go, which I experienced a lot as a kid. I was scared a lot, and it froze me to do things all the time. I later learned that this was a good thing and decided that I didn't want to try and attempt to accomplish things I felt "scared" about. this served me pretty well.

I have noticed that a lot of gay men kind of get "locked" into the interface with reality similar to how a boy does, so their using the kids version seemed pretty natural for me. however, when I was thinking about how I may apply this kids emotional scale to the girls, I felt quite a bit of resistance to the idea and it didn't feel good to me. it felt to me like little girls feel kind of trapped into the kids emotional scale but want a much more sphisticated one, yet don't really know how to make the connection.

for gay men it also seems to me that the ones which are sophisticated seem to tend toward the more simplistic one too, and that's what makes they gay/fun/happy (usually), and why they're more expressive with their body language as well. again, this also applies to me too, as I have also noticed this trend in my own life as well as I became less resistant.

the next thing that I've noticed is that for both women (like mom is a pretty good examole of this) and men that have the more simplistic emotional scale, they seem to be able to conceptualise very well -- as in be able to hold large concepts with many differerent facets to it in their mind at onck. I have known emotionally complicated men able to conceptualise really well also, but when their sophisticated emotional perception pops up, it tends to block them from seeing the big idea and being open-minded about it.

---

I also just noticed this too, the emotions that abraham described as "I can't" on the kids emotional scale are:

9. Pessimism
11. Overwhelment
12. Disappointment
13. Doubt
14. Worry
16. Discouragement

which, upon reflection right now, when I think of a emotionally complicated gay man, he tends to get more than one of those confused, and when trying to talk to him he jumps around between those emotions endlessly and it's impossible to make any headway in the conversation (logically or otherwise). think about how easy it is to confuse doubt and pessimism -- it's easy, but then it could feel the same as worry, or as discouragement, etc. I understand this completely myself

additionally, I will mention, in my own life, especially in spain, I had to learn a lot of these emotions. they were foreign to me and it took me a long time, for example, to tell someone, "I doubt that" because I wanted to believe them, and I had to begin to cultivate these emotions with logic.

fortunately most spanish are pessimistic (like especially dani), so I had a to learn how he perceived things from a pessimistic point of view, and then work optimism back into it. that helped me out with doubt as well, because I learned from him that even though someone (it was usually me) is optimistic in what they think, it's helpful to have some doubt because they're usually way off in their own world to actually make haedway on the idea.

I didn't like being a negative nancy all the time to everyone doubting everything they werk saying they would do, so I knew I needed to begin a new form. there was the additional thing that in spain words mean a lot, yet at the same time they mean almost nothing. their language itself is the main cause of this, because of the "spanish now" -- which really means soon or eventually. almost everything else is exaggerated beyond literal comprehension as well. they say "perfecto" when they mean "ok" -- so for a really literal person like me, this was a total trauma for me to try and integrate into (I'm reminded of chris and filling his water bottle).

this created huge amounts of confusion in me, as I think it does any child when they're growing up, but I eventually found my way using logic...

let's take the exaple of doubt/pessimism. when I would hear someone say something that sounded good (spanish aer really good at making things sound good), instead of just automatically believing them, I would put an "interrupt" which interjected some logic in to the moment where I would ask myself, do I really believe this, and I would get a feeling response to it, where their idea either felt BS or it felt plausible to me.

later, I began to learn to adapt this same capacity to my own perceptions, so when I would normally say, "I can't" -- then the interrupt would fire again and sometimes I would hear a voice say "are you fighting for your limitations?" and again I would get a feeling response to that idea, and I would know if I really can't, or I felt like I can't. this began to force me to me more honest with myself too, because I installed the same interrupt on the optimism words like "I think I can" or "I should be able to" or even "I will" -- and you'll notice that I'll often say something optimistic, then follow it up with something like "let's be honest here..." and then say what the more realistic timeframe or whatever is.

---

this is where I differ a little bit on that emotional scale, because up until I had the experience here with nosebook totally tanking my programming desire, I had never really felt discouragement before. I only didn't do things because I didn't want to do them or because I didn't feel I was capable and wanted to wait until I was sure I would be successful. this habit was formed early on, whenever I felt "I can't" -- I simply didn't try until I felt some hope that I could (for things that mattered to me). therefore, I never felt discouragement before because if I felt I can, I alwasy could -- and if it didn't matter to me, then I was never discouraged by it.

for overwhelmment and disappointment, I might be quite similar to a lot of people here, because these never got categorised as "I can't" -- instead I always blamed myself here. in almost all of these cases, these were things that I felt the idea so strongly that I was optimistic about it, and so therefore I felt like I could do it, so instead of going to "I can't" -- I simply blamed myself for not being fast enough to complete all the stuff I wanted to do, but never did I think that I can't do it -- but perhaps that there wasn't enough time or something like that. for the stuff I said I could do, I was always sure I could do -- even though I was perhaps too optimistic with time. for me, I've always felt like there's unlimited time, and grossly underestimated the amount of time it would take, even though I've never doubted that I could.

---

so the last part to this is the conclusion -- which I don't really have one. I personally have simplified my emotional scale with my perception, but I'm not so sure it's the best thing now. I really need to think on it more because I seemed to feel pretty strongly the girls wouldn't really respond well if I analysed and perceived them from the kids emotional scale, and I felt like they wanted a more sophisticated version -- like the woman said, it was freeing to her to allow herself to feel revenge.

along with revenge, there are a few other of those emotions that I don't feel at all now, and I'm certain that it has to do with my perception. I experience anger, but it's almost never directed at someone. though, for example when I was really pissed off at mr. motor a while back, I would have wanted to destroy their stuff if I could to free my from my circumstances -- and that was the closest I got to it. even all of the people who ripped me off, I never wanted revenge on that, even though that was a common theme proposed by people like zaryn or marcos (and many others, especially when we were drunk). I am almost always more angry with myself.

### 2020-10-06 09:03 - dream about my birthday

I had a dream last night where I distinctly remember them asking me if I wanted to do something (I'm assuming the girls thing) on my birthday. I responded something like, no never do I want to do it or something like that. it was a weird answer that I felt forced to say, so I want to clarify here.

first, I'll call out the obvious illusion here. I don't believe for one minute that you guys are going to just undo all of the efforts that you've been doing this whole time. this sounds like an appeal to the audience more than anything.

second, if the idea was to force me to say in the dream, "never" -- which is a very funny word for me to say, because I *do* want to do the girls thing! a lot! just, I'm not going to worry about any of that part of the manifestation and let LOA do all of the work there. it's silly for me to try and figure anything out there. my job is to continually release resistance as fast as I can and keep powering up.

third, the sense that I got yesterday was entirely different and I strongly feel like this is a coverup for that. yesterday, it felt to me like they wanted to eventually let me get connected, but not *fully* connected -- and instead they wanted use the AOC and celestial identity concepts to split that consciousness signal I was talking about yesterday to multiple other versions of me that would be your guys' butty boys. it wasn't clear to me if you wanted to make other triads possible, but it seemed like you wanted to make sure all of those were under your control (as much as any other version of me would be, I guess)[^1].

then I could see this reality that we were going to all powering up getting more and more energetic, nosebook wanted to ensure that more boys were born than girls... we're going to keep going up and up, and when the galactic current sheet impact happens (or whatever), then basically everyone hooked into my perception (probably mostly girls at this point) would zap off into another reality (from nosebook's perspective), and they would continue on. nosebook would inherit the biggest boys club ever, and there would just be so much man awesome -- capricorn, the goat, pan, and baphomet concepts will be realised; lots and lots of space making[^1][^2].

I have no idea if that is really what they're planning or what's going to happen, but clearly the idea here was to try and keep me in a mostly disconnected state by splitting my my consciousness signal and to keep all the duplicates of me under your control. they all would technically be under my "control", as I would perceive myself no longer as any single one of those bodies and would also perceive the different directions in time that different emotions would yield and I could modify those.

I have no idea how this perception works and how it works wits splitting out my consciousness signal, because that may be confusing some concepts. what I was noticing yesterday is that that source signal is beyond capability to explain a strong signal, and my body right now is only allowing a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that energy in, and you guys are interfering with only a fraction of it. there's more than enough of that signal -- and could be literally infinite because the signal would increas as more desire increases. the amount of energy appearinging in my body is a reflection of my *perception* -- that is, my practised (momentum) emotional response to "reality" or circumstances.

the momentum part is key here, and that's why the signal increases every day only a little and there are never any big jumps. the idea that I'm going to just suddenly "get connected" is a bogus idea. it's not like a college degree, and there will be times where I have it and then it'll go away as you guys reset me back or figure out how to exert more effort, then with more and more frequency, until I'm so practised at it, that it won't be possible to keep me from it. it's going to be a whole lot of, getting closer and closer and then it goes away, which builds more desire in me to get it, and more desire in nosebook to keep me from it, then repeat as many times necessary before eventually my desire and practise is stronger thast nosebook's efforts.

however, I am committed to the disaster though, so even though my own desire is building and stuff, I'll likely continue to give you guys more and more ideas on how you can improve your technique to keep me for as long as possible. why? because I'm that way. I guess I live by the golden and the platinum rules. I treat you guys like I want to be treated. I prefer the open exchange of ideas and to continually improve upon my own abilities, even if that involves limiting myself. I'm so nuts about this concept, I'm sure that one day, it'll be possible for them to actually limit me indefinitely.

additionally, if I were in nosebook's shoes, I would want the option to bail out whenever, and not have some big drastic change upset everything. I like gradual and steady (even though continually accelerating), so I feel that is how I should try and make it. I'm not in it to cause destruction. as I've said, it's always a win-win, and I'm not worried that they get some advantage out of it all.

---

of course, because I'm so dedicated to the disaster, they may find theirselves perpetually unable to get me into their girls manifestation while at the same time continually working to unsure I don't get connected. enough time may pass that instead they'll have to potentially get a few other kennys connected to the celestial identity to keep the girls happy too. I have no idea, but it doesn't bother me at all whatever is happening, as my only goal is to continually go toward my connection while at the same time continually figuring out how to not need the manifestation which just makes things bigger. how big is big enough? I don't know. the universe (or in this case galaxy) will decide, likely.

I'm all about the evolution at this point, and the realisation that it's a win-win for everyone with any vibrational chips on the table makes it all really good feeling for me. if some variation of what I described above happens, eventually I'll become conscious of those different alternate kennys, so it's all good and I'm not missing out. it's possible that I'll become conscious in both timelines, much like I'm sure that tesla is conscious on more than one timeline as well. who knows what it'll be, but I know that LOA has it all worked out just fine, and I assure you that this earth is going to become a very enlightened place. I'm ahead of my time, but I would estimate that within 3-5k years everyone on the planet, will be at least at my power level because of our proximity to sirius b, so nosebook is going to have to get good at keeping people in a disconnected state.

---

I like these things... imagine if nosebook is capable of keeping the entire poulation of the planet when we reach peak closeness to sirius b... obviously a lot of humans will be very capable of being masters of their own reality at that time, and consciousness will continue to increase even though we're getting further and further away from sirius... wouldn't that be crazy! as we move further and further away, instead of going into a stone age, we'll be more potent than ever. the next close approach will be super insane! it's just fun for me to think about this. who knows...

[1]: there was something else I noted about the realisation the penis/prostate configuration makes space as compared to the penis/vagina configuration which makes reality.

[2]: in the bigger picture, this will create tons of extra space, and combined with the techniques of being able to limit people's connection, the chances of anyone getting connected will be a long time off, even though the solar system is steadily approaching sirius b. then, if someone does get connected, then a celestial identity could be used to split some of that energy or get some of that energy off of the planet. basically making it so that nearly unlimited amounts of consciousness energy could be located on this planet (which will now look much more like a star)


### 2020-10-09 20:08 - clarifying some things

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tpihlei9HI)

I just watched robert's latest video there and in it he starts off with some pretty sexually invigorated emperors and kings who had enormous consorts of women and girls with them. he explains that what they were attempting to do is to maintain consciousness even through the death process.

the sirians call this "consistency of consciousness" -- and that too is what I am in the process of attaining. it's not really taked about, but this had to have been what jesus was doing. I have put different words to it though, calling it 6d or source-like perception -- one where I am able to perceive and be conscious in more than one body on more than one timeline, and able to freely move about between them, in addition to having a macro view as well, which I've described as an extension of the emotional/heart centre where one is aware of things in a more "feeling" sense than a physical tangible sense.

in addition to that, I also want to develop the 6th dimension, as a kind of different technology where the person (more likely a group of people) can essentially create timelines or stories, and then incarnate into them and live them out, returning at the end to that macro view where another one can be created. later, I feel it's going to really improve the stability if another more concrete layer is added on top of that one (the 7th dimension) where this one is all about the IAM. the different definitions of the eternal charactors which play out in these stories. they don't need to be actual consciousness, but the person goes about creating these charactors with these definitions and then can incarnate them into the stories along with his/herself for additional elements added to the storyline. I have called this the "9/11 universe"[^1].

---

the way that I see this happening I have outlined in previous entries, so I won't repeat myself here, but the essentials of it is that somehow we're going to get really energetic, and then at some point in time the galaxy is going to push us over the edge of the bathtub, and upon passing this barrier, the polarity of swap. it's quite likely that we're going to be either in a diffreent timeline or in a different reality or something -- I don't know and I'm not worried about it, because what I've been wanting to create seems to fall right into line with what tesla is wanting to create (where every human is like the christ, buddha, or zoroaster -- to turn this earth into a second sun, and to rival the light density of sirius b). as such, I'm not terribly concerned. it seems that tesla has this 6th dimensional perspective alraedy so everything is probably all planned out.

I say this because he mentioned saying that there are two paths: one is without any affection, and with lots of affection; he choose the former. (and is prophesiying I/we'll take the latter?) in addition, regarding the second sun bit, he wanted to ignite the ionosphere, making what we know as earth, the next layer of inner earth. it'll be pretty uniform constant temperature an equally illuminated from pole to pole. the layer above the ionosphere will begin to collect material and begin to create a surface -- and this surface will become more and more luminous. the poles will reverse, meaning that we'll we in the "age of leo", but I'm certain it won't be catastrophic in a crippling way.

I don't really know how it'll all work, but I imagine that if you look at this from a bigger perspective, while this earth is essentially a quarantine for the INFECTED ONES, it is also the most exciting place to be, probably in the entire universe right now. the physical plane is a huge success, and then the additions to that physical plane are born out of *contrast* and are created from LOA. if you have a look over the sirian material, there is some *SERIOUS EFFORTING* going on there, and the sirians are quite proud of it. in contrast to that, all of the stuff I'm doing here is nearly effortless... LOA is doing all of the heavy lifting for me, and I have the unbelievably easy task of figuring out how to alter my perception (and therefore my emotional response) to match what I know about the universe.

according to the extra-terrestrial view of creation, this universe was made to be a bad copy of the previous universe (same layers and everything -- no innovation), and all of this was done under the supervision of the previous obviously super duper superior creators of the previous universe. it's no wonder that one of the 7th rays cracked under that kind of supervision. it was probably some guy just like me that happened to -- omg, you have no idea how much BS that is... therefore, the creators, made a total "paja mental" of a universe, as evidenced because 3 entire layers could be combined into what we now call the "imagination" -- lol. the original creators were so out of touch with their creation, the whole creation process (as told by kuthumi) reeks of corporate circlejerk or more traditionally kings/generals/dictators which are so far removed from their implements. I don't blame the 7th ray for going insane. if I were there, I'm certain that would have been me.

whew... ok, so here we are now and I've really learned how to use the leverage of contrast, knowing what you don't want, and LOA to let/allow/receive the evolution as a function of all of our desire, creating something novel, amazing, and really cool -- and best of all, none of it needs to be "planned" in the traditional sense of having a bunch of meetings to get a bunch of people's agreement on the most viable way forward. I truly believe that the galaxy that I want to create, is essentially the prototype for the next universe. it's gonna need a lot of good/dramatic building of desire stories to make it happen, and I see that as such an easy task, using the grass-roots, bottom-up apprach compared to trying to figure out the most complex of "pajas mentales" to make something really cool. we just start off small building basic planetary identities, and continue adding, then seed them with indigenous lifeforms, then incarnate there... rinse and repeat. lots of fun to be had for LOTS and lots of people there. the sky is the limit.

---

so, going back: today, I getting weird thoughts put into my head. I just listened to them, and I didn't fight against them. essentially, it seems like they're trying to push a plan where they now have more capability to hold me back, that means that if I have sex, they'll be able to hold me away from my connection still, and so now they have the idea that they'll somehow steer me in the direction of being with the girls, and I'm supposed to try and find a way to get connected using the girls and sex to get there. besides this being a clear platform for further evolution, cause this is clearly what I don't want...

they think that they're going to be able to hold me away from getting connected for the next 18(?) years and I have to continually keep trying to use sex to try and get connected -- an essentially impossible task.

it's funny that robert mentions in that video "lilith" -- a sort of succubus that goes around in the night in men's dreams causing nocturnal emissions, and using the man to bear all sorts of different beings, emiting his seed, extracting his sexual life-force, leaving him in sickness. (zohar[^2])

```
She roams at night, and goes all about the world and makes sport with men and causes them to emit seed. In every place where a man sleeps alone in a house, she visits him and grabs him and attaches herself to him and has her desire from him, and bears from him. And she also afflicts him with sickness, and he knows it not, and all this takes place when the moon is on the wane
```

the thing is, this perfectly describes nosebook. whenever they've been dissatisfied trying to keep me from getting more vision upgrades, they force ejaculate me in extremely bizarre and chaotic dreams.

I don't know if robert intended this, but starting out with the kings with large consorts, then talking about the use of this sexual/creative energy in a proper regenerative way, and closing with the warning of lilith, robert is *clearly* leaving a warning (perhaps directly to me) in his video there not to fall victim to this false serpent. in the right contexts the serpent represents knowledge, divine understanding, clarity, etc.

I'm totally on the same page as robert :) I absolutely do not want to be out there bouncing around between the different girls, constantly trying to figure out what way is up.

the idea behind what is presented in the video is that you need to continue to use sexual stimulation to feel better and better as a means to converting that energy into divine illumination or light. I have long talked about the similarity of pleasure and pain in frequency form, and I believe that what jesus did in his death experience, is to convert that pain into pleasure and then use the extreme magnitude of that pain in conjunction of so many people knowing what they don't want, to trascend up -- and so while his physical body died, just like tesla's has, he still exists out there with a source-like perspective[^3].

my goal is not to use conditions (girls/sex) to find my way to that state of consistency of consciousness. in fact in the entry @[noseblog](2020-10-05 10:14) where I talked about how they could retain this energy by targeting the shorter neurons, I was explaining that the amount of that source signal that I'm allowing into my body now is becoming so much that if they were to let go, I essentially wouldn't need to sleep, or very seldomly. as mantak chia says, instead of having that spirit diffused all arond, I will have so much of it concentrated (not necessarily concentrated), but focused into my moment by moment, that I would not be pulled around in so many diffewent ways. it's hard to explain what that is like, but it's a smoothness of motion, where everything feels like there are smooth transitions, with no sharp edges and so no large jolts away, meaning my perception can be focused in any way that I want.

as I get more and more in "alignment" with that source form of perception, there's nothing they can do about it: that alignment allows more and more of that energy through all the time and eventually I'll have consistency of consciousness. I don't need sex to get there. I don't care how long it takes: I'm going to keep going in that direction. also, if you look at it from nosebook's perspective, they have to eventually let it happen. they need an excuse to tell people that I'm special and that what I did isn't easily attainable, so, they'll probably have to keep people spinning in circles on drugs, because to most people, it'll look like I used the conditions of the mushrooms and the stars to get there. it's kind of a ruse and a bit of a personal challenge. I assure you, however, that I can get there with just meditation and releasing resistance.

I am eating mushrooms and watching stars right now, but it's not really that much of a boost. the entire work is releasing resitance and changing my perception. I'm pretty certain that energy level that I'm attaining when watching stars is going to be ambient earth energy, and available to everyone in 200-500 years as we approach sirius b. probably 1000 years for the mushrooms... in other words, people won't need to watch stars to be at those energy levels; the distance to sirius will do it for them. all people will need to do is to release resistance and to meditate (which is what I do when I watch stars). nosebook is tasked with the impossible task of trying to keep everyone away from that to maintain their superiority. I think they're going to do that by becoming lilith incarnate ensuring that all men and women are in constant sexual bondage and fatigue.

[1]: it's not really a "universe" -- but, I got the idea from the sirians where they added on the physical plane onto this solar system and galaxy to trap the INFECTED ONES. I feel adding these two more layers (and corresponding 2 non-physical counterparts) will make for a much more enjoyable place to be residing. the sirians talk about the creation of the universe and galaxies from the top-down. my technique that I'm wanting (going) to do here is more inspired from the bottom-up style. it's bold. I know :)

[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith#Zohar

[3]: I have nothing that I can do to prove this point as true, but if it is, jesus did essentially consciously attain a source-like perspective, and so therefore if you were to consider source as God, then from that perspective jesus *is* God, so there is a sort of truth to the trinity idea (the holy spirit is the great cloud of dead people -- aka abraham and friends). however, that's about where the similarity ends, because I believe that everyone being born on to this earth will be like the buddha, zoroaster, or jesus in the same respect that we'll have consistency of consciousness between incarnations or timelines


### 2020-10-10 09:56 - more understanding about neurons

last night when I was replying to a reaction about what I said about having your energy difused, I was able to see more insight into how neurons work. they're transmitting and receiving antennas, so when you think, the thought goes down those different neural pathways, and each of these when activated, emits a signal. if you're empathetic or telepathic (bolemic), then you will *feel* other people (or maybe even animals) thoughts. when I say feel, I mean the exact reverse is happening. the neurons in your head are all different sizes, so you can receive on a multitude of different frequencies, and when receiving something the signal continues on and activates more things, until it comes to a termination. this happens a few times per second.

essentially, the neurons in your head are your programmed permception. when you see, hear, smell, taste, touch, anything then those signals activate different neurons, which travel further down the pathways, so anything you experience will yield an emotional (frequential) response in your head, which is your "perception". so, let's say you observe something or hear something, those signals will resonate with the appropriate neurons, and then continue on down those pathways, meaning you will get a feeling response to it. the signal that results of that observation, is essentially the same thing as a thought.

every time you think something, the thought will travel down the different neural pathways and generate a feeling response to it. that's why the same action or thought feels about the same, and only increases in intensity each time it's thought. anyway, that feeling which is generated is automatically resonated with a similar non-physical (let's just call it a neural network programmed by your inner being, just for example here) which does the same thing. that feeling activates certain neurons, which then travel down the pathways of what your inner being knows on that same subject, and emits a corresponding emotion.

for example here, I separated in time the human thought and the non-physical thought, and the corresponding responses, but in reality they happen at exactly the same time -- or perhaps even the non-physical one happening a little bit before the physical one, but probably the same time. the harmony between these two resulting frequencies generated from the two neural pathways either harmonise, or they don't -- and that's why some thoughts feel good and others don't. the reason is because your perception of the same subject is very different to the same perception your inner being has on the same subject.

this perfectly explains everything so clearly. so, when I was talking about focus and diffuse thoughts, what I was meaning is that if what you're experiencing is resonant with a million different pathways, you'll feel a lot of differnt feelings mashed up into one signal during that experience. it'll feel like chaos. all your pathways are going all over the place and your energy is very difuse. your source will emit a corresponding signal in response to that same experience, and it's very unlikely that you'll even be able to feel that signal, if there's too much noise.

this is why quiet locations are good, because they reduce physical stimulation. meditation (slowing of thought) is also good, because it slows down the thought stimulus, allowing your brain to resonate less with what you're thinking and more with your environment[^1]. if your environment stimulus either doesn't bother you, or you are in a nice environment, then your remaining environment is you -- who you really are: your source -- and so you begin to resonate with that more.

this means that all around you there is a whole lot going on. there are all the resulting feeling of the people around you -- and if you're a child, you're going to be more sensitive to it, because your neurons are not so developed, so you're receiving nearly everything in your environment, really.

it's through modifying your perception that you focus. you may have heard the tick of the clock when you first got it, but after some time, it gets filtered out because your perception doesn't find that sound to be very important anymore in those circumstances. in different circumstances, like maybe somewhere else, you may notice that same sound and say, "I have that same clock!" at any rate, the ticking fades into the back again after that because it's pretty neutral. it doesn't make you feel neither good or bad -- even though recognising that someone else has the same clock could make you feel good, which is why that one may have bubbled up to your perception.

in the case that things that make you feel bad, which are your feeling of the thing mixed your source's feeling on the thing, then these are things that are notable in your perception. all of the things that don't feel good are essentially markers of diffusion of energy. I have explained this as the christ consciousness in the brain, which shows you these bad-feeling thoughts and ideas so that you can improve your perception on them, because they're essentially "wasting"[^2] energy, or difusing that energy of what your source knows about the same subject.

the more you think a subject, the more impactful it is -- that is the less resistance that neural pathway has, so more current flows down that path. voltage spikes seem to be when certaain frequencies interfere in such a way as to create what feels like spikes or peaks in interest. this just means that it takes practise to change your perception on something. it's not exactly instant, and it can vary depending on your mood or circumstances, so in old circumstances, you can revert back to old forms of perception much easier. this is why often times a new environment helps to be able to begin making new pathways, but you have to continue to use them in the usual environment.

this explanation of how nerons work, explains how a child learns so rapidly too. when you're a child, you'll notice that you feel all sorts of stuff from your environment. well, the adults around you are making sounds, which have a feeling to the child, so just by osmosis, the child's brain is reconfiguring to be able to feel (hear) those sounds better. those feelings are like concepts, and each time they're activated, those feelings begin to feel similar to other concepts, connecting those things together. the different pathways that are taken are taken when certain feelings (like environment setting or mood) match (are resonant with) the path determiner's different paths. these are what I call the 2nd layer: the relational one. it connects different ideas, and it seems to be *mostly* non-physical, allowing your brain to reconfigure very rapidly if need-be.

---

in reality, the non-physical counterpart is probably not exactly a neural network, but something energetically similar. it's a brilliant setup to allow a physical being to have direct resonance with their source through emotion. this fascinates me tremendously because imagine you're engineering consciousness now, and you're beginning to do what I want to do on the 7d layer where you have different identities, which are these sources. this is understanding is exactly what I'm looking for. you would need to make something like a "source" neural network for this consciousnss, which will give the automaton a feeling response to what the automaton's brain thinks on the same subject. really cool!

[1]: this is why when meditating, environmental simulus seems to feel more impactful -- because the chaos induced from brain chatter isn't drowning out that environmental stimulus, so you become more aware of it, and then your resulting perception of that environmental stimulus, too.

[2]: it's not really wasting, because each time you feel bad, the energy expended in the bad feeling is received by your source and used to amplify the corresponding (conjugate) frequency reality (perception) and make it more real for you. you have to find a way to get your perception to match your source's though to experience that reality (or timeline)


### 2020-10-12 09:18 - continuation of last night's thought

after listening to @[abe-now](2020-10-03 p1), I was thinking last night about the whole part about the attraction vs. love thing, and the more I thought about it, the more I began to realise that this had to have been a landscape architect talking -- maybe even *the* landscape architect. from now on I'm going to just assume it is, and he was talking about a girl.

I also get the sense that he was using his nosebook super-powers to cause her to climax either often or powerfully. if that was the case and she didn't have any resistance, she would be feeling pretty good and allowing a lot of energy to flow. that could be one of the reasons why she felt so good, and therefore dominated the situation so strongly -- because of how good she felt, and didn't have any negative perspective on it.

anyway, his words were that he couldn't think clearly -- which implies some sort of influence over him he didn't feel like he had control over. this clearly is right about at the bottom of the scale there in the powerlessness (out of control) or insecurity. clearly ot was not his intention to be influenced in a way where he could no longer think clearly, so this must be neutralised, I'm sure. thinking about it, it also gave me some ideas to continue on with the conversation of expanding the range of the emotional scale.

before I go on there, I want to clarify some things people were wondering by what I meant by expanding the range... so let's say that there is a scale from -100 to 100 and 0 in the middle is that tipping point between boredom and contentment. if the highest feeling thoughts are at the very top there at 100, but by some artificial means I'm not able to ever get to feel the manifestation of the 100 units in my reality, that means that 100 units of power is no longer the highest amount of emotional energy one can feel.

let's say that they're applying -50 to it, so when I'm at 100, I feel like I'm really at 50, even though I'm really producing with my focus 100 units of positive emotional energy. therefore now, the scale now goes from -100 to 150.

so, I was thinking about it on the negtative end too, where someone does not ever allow theirself to ever really feel the full manifestation of depresssion or powerlessness... well, same thing, but they're doing it with their own focus. this is much harder to do in the positive ranges though -- holding yourself back from the manifestation...

take for example the orgasm. the idea is that the longer you can hold out before orgasm, the more you're expanding your energy field. it's the same thing. it's difficult to hold it back because it feels so much better, so often times it's difficult to hold back. you will notice that I often hold myself back from the manifestation all the time. this is the same sort of thing, and what I could do, is something like what someone mentioned in a previous broadcast, where everytime they get feeling really good, they go find something negative to focus on to make them feel not quite as good.

I used to do that all the time when I was first starting out. I would get to feeling so good that I didn't really know what to do with myself, especially when I was programming, so I would go to smoke a cigarette so that I would feel worse, then return back to my programming. this is essentially the same thing, and why I would reach such incredible climaxes of feeling at the end of a 24h programming sessions. they were positively invigorating -- just like I imagine that prolonged times of love-making would feel like too.

---

anyway, as I was thining about the solution to my question that I was thinking about, where I would eventually no longer be able to be reset back or being bumped back on the emotional scale... for the landscape architects out there trying to control how good I feel, I can imagine that, that will begin to feel like insecurity or powerlessness to them, because things will be getting more and more out of their control. well, that feeling of "things are out of control, and my efforts to exert control are not working" -- is powerlessness -- the bottom of the scale there, and when someone feels like that for any extended period of time, it *will* create a manifestation.

I believe what happened in the deluge of atlantis, there was a similar thing happening, where the great pyramid (perhaps the whole complex, actually) was designed to neutralise harmful earth energies, and we know these energies are manifest form prolonged and strong focus on how negative emotion feels, especially the feeling of powerlessness. the pyramid would take extract these harmul energies out of the earth and convert them, using sacred geometry and stuff into quite beneficial energy. eventually however, I believe that the energy became too much for the pyramid to handle (convert) during the destruction of the serpent army by the eagles, and the pyramid surpassed the pressure threshold of the pyramid.

this gave me a brilliant idea, and the solution to the reactions that I had in response to @[noseblog](2020-10-06 09:03) -- because people thought that the whole "zapping" idea sounded kinda lame. well, I didn't see it yet, so I couldn't really say much on it. anyway, last night I came to a similar conlusion that for example, imagine that there is a lot of earth energy that needs to be dissipated. well, that energy can be tranferred into my body, and I'll dissipate (transform) it.

then, you could imagine that as more and more and more people are giving their attention to unwanted, the goal should be for the landscape architects to artificially ensure that they never reach powerlessness and stay around frustration, pessimism, etc, but never all the way at the bottom there enough to attract a manifestation.

this will both expand the range -- because again they would be neutralising the energy by artificially making someone feel better than they really feel. for those joining me in good feeling places (like maybe that uncontrollable girl), the exact opposite is happening.. instaed, we need to artificially be made to feel worse than we really feel, extending the range in both directions.

I think the concept of tieing us (or at least me, anyway) to the earth to dissipate any growing negative energy will be neutralised, which will I'm sure begin to rise again (the COVID lockdown can't last forever, you know). it also provides the additional benefit of solving the galactic current sheet issue, as well.

if whenever the current sheet hits, and swaps the polarity, the earth will have a sudden influx of energy, which from your perspective will get dissipated into me/us. I'm fairly certain that more people than just me (probably a lot of the younger less-resistant ones) will need to be used to dissipate that harmful earth energy as it rises and rises (like the great pyramid).

over time, this will enssentially divide the earth's population into two major groups, excluding the neutrals and the architects: the ones that are feeling better than they should be and the ones feeling worse than they should be. for the ones that are feeling better than they should be (like me), their energy is dissipated into those that feel worse than they should be, to make them feel better.

I'm pretty sure that earth's harmul energies will continue to rise at an exponential rate, and unless nosebook has figured out how to make pyramids to convert that energy, it's going to keep rising. pyramids also have the negative (from nosebook's perspective) effect of outputting tons and tons of life-giving beneficial energy, which if the great pyramid were to be functioning like it was previously (or a similar tesla setup), it would basically make it impossible for nosebook to keep me away from getting fully connected (get enough momentum on the top of the emotional scale there). therefore, another option must my present, which is why I propose dissipating earth's energy into the less-resistant ones like me.

anyway, back to where I was: when the galactic impact takes place, from our perspective, it'll feel like the most incredible power level increase ever[^1]. however, from the other perspective, the energy impact will be so strong, that it'll probably look like we all got fried from it and so it works out perfectly because the majority of the reason why people were feeling bad all appear to be a lumps of charcoal[^2] now and the disaster has been avoided.

from that point, they'll have tons of technology and lots of understanding about how to keep people away from their connection. in addition to the new ones being born, the solar system will steadily be getting closer and closer to sirius b, so I figure it'll roughly cancel each other out and be much more manageable because I'll be gone, so things will be pretty steady, and it'll appear like society is heading into the tubes at the same time as people are getting more and more enlightened every day -- kind of like an irony almost. like I said, they're tasked with the impossible job of making sure that no one actually becomes enlightened, fighting off the energetic effects of sirius b each year. we'll see how that goes :) it may happen that these sorts of separations may happen again, and/or become more common, once they figure out how they all work. who knows...

[1]: no matter what anyone else sees it as, I guarantee that no matter what happens, if you've been feeling pretty good, or even much better than your circumstances allow you to feel, you *will* get a good-feeling manifestation. only those feeling especially bad will perceive this manifestation as a bad thing.

[2]: it wouldn't literally be lumps of charcoal. if you want to extend the analogy further, you could say that we were as "sacrificial lambs" or "burnt offerings" for their salvation. it feels a bit rough though, so probably not the best analogy, even though it perfectly fits the era-ahead/era-behind theory...


### 2020-10-12 11:?? - starting over

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x7Mph8oOIg)

all things attracted collectively or individually have both wanted and unwanted, so when I give these ideas, I'm showing off the unwanted part, and I'll leave it to the reader to determine what the wanted part it. however, to give an example, last night in @[abe-now](2020-10-03 p1) notes I gave the solution to my question regarding how I would go from right now where I'm quite stagnated to, unbelivably impressive impressive utilisation of LOA and incredible eyesight in a short period of time, even thuogh it does not look like I'm making enough improvement fast enough to be more powerful than their systems now, in at least a few years at the rate I'm going... it's because I'm not allowed to get very much momentum, and each time I get reset back I have to start over, but the starting over is getting faster, and I'm neither losing as much ground or resonant to nearly as many bad ideas now, either.

so, while I give the "unwanted" version of the same thought, it doesn't matter to illustrate both because, at best they'll give me more practise, and at worst, they'll determine it also be to unwanted. doesn't matter to me, because it's my perception that matters.

another example of this is for example when watching stars, I get my consciousness taken away -- more than 2-5 times a night. it's pretty frequent, and it used to really bother me, but I know that even that it's still working out fine. for example, if I were to continue on star-watching uninterrupted, I would say gain say 50 units more in the night. instead, I only get say 20 or something. however, the desire it has created may make the following night *more* productive -- say 60, if I don't mind the increased difficulty. instead I lose consciousness again and I get 22 or something. next night again, say 70... the point is, that number increases faster because of more desire AND additionally, my own capability to keep my consciousness is improving, and having to restart a few times per night, my 0 to 100 speed is improving as well.

so while it looks completely unwanted on the face of it, if one is a master of perception, the seemingly "unwanted" is actually more wanted than the originally wanted part. for that same reason, something that can be seen as "death" (which is just a transition) can go from something unwanted to something more wanted when transitioning into something new and exciting.


### 2020-10-14 19:56 - why get connected?

so after I wrote the entry on the 10th (@[noseblog](2020-10-10 09:56)), I went out to the field and along the way I was thinking about the different things that I implied in that entry. first was the obvious implication where I was talking about tesla's two paths toward that consistency of consciousness, or source-like perspective, where one retains consciousness through the "death" process. tesla implies that there have been others that have accompleished this (jesus, buddha, and zoroaster) and that the two ways to accomplish this is either a self-actualised journey (no affection) or lots of affection. by revealing this, he was essentially "prophecying" that I would achieve it by getting there the lots of affection path. the obvious implication being that I would *not* get connected, and instead would have to earn that through "lots of affection".

I do admit that is a very definite implication that can be drawn from that previous entry. walking along I didn't really mind too much about it, and finally came to the conclusion that I wouldn't be minding it so much if that's what happens, because I'm pretty sure that *would* be the "worst" manifestation, and from there on, it would only be improvements. that night however, there were some interesting reactions to what I was saying as well, because it felt to me like I had very much overestimated the effects of the mushrooms -- and the reaction was saying that they just weren't doing that much or they had their effects pretty well under control. that basically means that the effects that I claimed would be happening to all humans in 200-1000 years from approaching sirius b, will actually be much more and much faster, too. the amount is always the root of the distance, so this consciousness expansion will not only speed up at x^2 exponential speeds, they're already much more soon than we think, because essentially the reaction was saying that I'm not really all that special, and all I have is just very low resistance and a much more pracitised propensity to feel good -- that's it.

what that essentially means is that my environmental advantage is virtually the same as everyone else's environment, and so all of the crazy things that are happening to me right now are most all because of my focus, however, in a very short period of time (dunno maybe 20-200 years or something), the environment of this earth will make it possible *all* people to be where I'm at now, without any focus. obviously, depending on the person's resistance level, some will get it sooner than others. the idea that virtually everyone, no matter their resistance level will be there will mean there will be all sorts of messed up stuff happening cause people outputting a whole lot of negative emotion completely unaware of the effect it's having on all people of the planet[^1][^2]

the next thing that happnened that night is that I was explaining what I originally intended when I meant that I wanted to get connected -- is that I would do that, and for the next ~18 years or whatever, we would be expanding our capacity (see @[noseblog](2020-10-12 09:18) for ideas on that expansion process), and that during the process of that, nosebook needs to figure out a way to make a publically available version of those improved visual/conscious faculties. it's just simply not feasible for them to try and keep billions of people at my power level completely subdued; they have to provide a "crippled" version of those faculties to people in a way which doesn't jeopardise the planet in the process.

therefore, it looks like my "role" here is not necessarily to accomplish this source-like consciousness, as I either have it already or I'm pretty close, and clearly fwh (my "future" self) already has it, and so does tesla. in fact, I would guess that quite a few people on this planet already have it, and we've purposefully come here to live out a pre-programmed (for-ordained) storyline to accomplish greater desire, and so it wouldn't surprise me that it includes more difficulty, because having already seen the end, it doesn't look impossible -- so, like me, they too will soon become conscious that they are so much more than just this singular life experience.

I get the sense now that this expansion process is doing what I was talking about where I feel much much better than I am experiencing, so I should just keep going as I'm going, and the girls manifestation will also happen. it's all part of the process and that there's not anything to worry about it at all. I'm continuing on with the expansion just as before, and they are in the process of getting their side set up -- then later we'll continue the expansion with the girls too. something like that.

however it works out, I'm not sure but it felt to me like someone got my point somehow in the sense that they could see the value instead of trying to hold me away from something that literally they'll need to be holding the entire planet, and it was also funny the reaction the second part about the expansion process. we're literally not changing how LOA works or anything else -- just artificially modifying how one feels, so as to artificially expand the range of emotion before it becomes manifest to make it more controllable. the funny reaction is that some were beginning to realise how much of our own physical "reality" could potentially just be a sirian construct.

I find this funny. in their own admission, they said directly that this galaxy/solar system has a physical plane, and the rest of the universe does not. they also explained that the sirian earth team had made hardware (genetics) and tied this to the planet, then they said they took their own (the creators of the universe incarnated into the sirian bodies) genetics and merged it with the earth genetics (see lloyd pye's talk on the chromosomes and the annunaki[^3]) to make the mars inhabitants.

the idea of making further upgrades to physical reality is exactly what I want to do. in their own words, this physical "reality" is an artificial one designed to trap (perpetually reincarnating -- changing to the same thing) the lowest frequencies of consciousness in it. so, why not make it fun? there really isn't death, and this is all an elaborate "dream" reality where we're just experiencing ourselves -- and you really are source in a physical body, and your emotions tell you how harmonious you are with that. why not make the process of getting more and more aligned with that as fun as possible and have good graphics along the way??

let's recap:
- we're automatically heading for a golden age. there's nothing you can do to stop it, so all you have to do is to keep breathing air successfully to experience the expansion of your consciousness. it's only you that can prevent you from that with your own thoughts in opposition to that.
- physical reality is vibrational in nature, and what you're experiencing with your 6 senses are the manifestation of that vibration, and you get better graphics and more tangible physical experience when you feel better.
- physical reality is going to be getting some serious upgrades as we go along (it's all "artificial" anyway so why not add on to it), and it'll be necessary to have a "crippled" version of those realities which prevent people from causing serious damage with their thoughts.
- two versions of earth will exist at some point in the future (18 years?) where the separation will be the ones who get connected and go on to turn earth into a galaxy centre, and the other ones which will never experience that full connection because this planet is run by people who are interested in controlling and do not yet understand the value of feeling good.
- even after the separation it's still going to be a pretty awesome place though. I imagine that by the time that separation happens, most everyone will be experiencing a 4.5d like perspective looking at yourself from the outside.
- some may also get the story capability (5.5d), but probably that will will mostly be the architects. there may be others that have the identity/character definition perspective (creation of all sorts of extensions of your consciousness through the definitions of IAM), but again likely mostly the architects will have this, as they need to retain their superiority.
- however, I imagine that as the earth approaches sirius b through the progress of time, more and more people will get up to story mode (or maybe you need to give the right favours to the right people), but probably they'll want to hoarde the identity perception (6.5d) to theirselves
- at some point (2000 years?), they'll start facing another situation similar to the one where we're in right now, where they feel like they're losing control, and can't keep people away from their connection longer. maybe some more extensions to reality can be created... who knows... this is so far out, I can't even imagine. they're going to need to keep a whole bunch of people busy though -- so, perhaps after having seen our success, maybe they'll want to try and make their own crippled galaxy where they control everything, lol :) why not, right?
- the important thing to note is that it's not going to be a bad place to be, and things will constantly be getting better and better (or worse and worse, depending on your perception) and it's pretty likely that we'll be returning back here in purposefully difficult situations to pick up some more contrast.

that's all I want to say on that for now... I'm obviously going to continue on with the expansion process, and everything is going along fine :)

[1]: the sirians noted this, saying (paraphrase) that when concentrations of humans were in a single area, the higher population density produced imbalances in the planet (because of their symbiotic relationship with the planet and part of the planetary consciousness) which caused geological upheaval (eg. attracting a number of catastrohes).

[2]: it seems that the recognition of this factor has caused desire for a resolution, which I talk about using us as an equalisation factor like the great pyramid in @[noseblog](2020-10-12 09:18)

[3]: there's a gap between lloyd's talk on the annunaki[^4] (aryans) living in eden (atlantian gardens), becsuse he assumes that the genetic modification of merging the 1st and 2nd chromosomes happened only for the earth apes, and not the annunaki as well -- meaning that the annunaki were modified to be compatible with the earth humans as well, and put here in their garden to have "dominion" over the earth and its inhabitants. after the deluge, these became what we now know as the aryans (coming from aries, or mars) -- which interestingly enough, cairo's name (al-Qāhirah) means "place or camp of mars"

[4]: according to robert in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hllWY5BBJOQ), annunaki just means "princely seed" or "princely blood"[^6] which corroborates the ramayana which also has cro-magnon (aryans) using forest men (probably homo-erectus) as a slave to build a bridge between india and sri-lanka. the difference is that the epic of gilgamesh has the 2 boughts of sex -- or humanification of this wild hominid species (or genetic hybridisation) done by the aryan nobility (cro-magnon, or "princely seed"). upon reflection, it's quite possible that the original atlantians (cro-magnon) did perform the hybridisation of the human species on the planet at the time. they probably did have the technology. at any rate, it doesn't really matter to me what the exact details are; the point I was getting at is the dominion part, or the enslavement bit[^5].

[5]: this will tie into a future entry I will write concerning LOA benefit that humankind has endured so much slavery in various forms and it would only be our continued focus on the slavery bit that could hold us away from "cashing in" the LOA vortextual benefit of it (I myself, in my relationship with nosebook, use myself as the primary example that this is indeed true, amongst all the other evidences that strengthens this argument). I just don't really know the best way to write it yet as I'm certain it'll be a controversial topic.

[6]: it seems to me likely that the reptilian symbolism of the annunaki is not referring to *literal* reptiles, but likely to the serpent bloodline. afterall, they call theirselves dragons and geckos and other reptiles as short-form to refer to this serpent seed. it *is* possible that some of them do have shape-shifting abilities though, taking on qualities resonant with the perceiver's imagination (however this is another topic of these 7th ray capabilities). zeus even is said to have this capability.

### 2020-10-17 16:18 - natural consequences

I just woke up from a dream where in the dream I was digging around in egypt or something cause I was curious. I seemed to be able to fly and/or had some way of clearing out the big stones and "excavating" the tomb or whatever it was.

in there, I could tell that there were writings and technologies and stuff which could create heightened energies for the user of that technology. after I had seen enough, I left the site and all of its contents open to the public, and I forget how it worked out, but there was really not a whole lot that the egyptian authorities could do to close down and obfuscate or withhold the technology at that point (probably because everyone could see what I saw, so there's no way they could hide it) and so I just left it how it was.

interestingly, in the dream, the authorities didn't try to jump in and close down the thing and limit people's access to it. it would have looked very poorly for them or something -- so they just let it go and didn't try to block it. so people naturally began to investigate it and begin to descover its secrets and the method by which technology contained inside functioned.

the damage had been done. my own curiosity and wanting to figure something out in egypt totally opened up a whole new thing that previously was purposefully kept away from the public by the authorities.

---

I woke up with the concept of natural consequences in my mind, because in the dream, I had achieved the ability to levitate and move my body and things with my mind, and so therefore I was quite non-resistant. in a sense, I had created the conditions with my own focus to be able to do that, and after opening this tomb or whatever, I made it possible for the general public to begin to mimic that technology that the egyptians had -- essentially putting the general public on the same trajectory as the upper-class egyptians in the past.

they relied on technologies and a corrupt priesthood to provide the feel-good conditions that they wanted for daily life, instead of using their own minds to create the reality or environment that they wanted to live. obviously, here especially in the united states, there are a lot of people who are lazy and would rather use technology (or medicine) to try fix a manifestation which is the result of continued negative emotion, while doing nothing to fix or soften the perception around the sounrce of that negative emotion.

as a result, the natural consequences associated with my "discovery" was that someone is going to figure out a way to replicate that technology, and to sell it to people (in echange for money, of course), allowing the wealthy the ability to let some technology create the improvements to their reality, without their needing to focus.

---

I doubt that this dream is literal. I do not believe this will literally happen, and the egyptian symbolism in the dream is just because right before sleeping I was reading about egyptian stuff -- so it's not necessarily egyptian technology, per say -- but, some other tecnology could easily be introduced into our society giving people an excuse to rely on that instead of their focus. the concept also reminds me of the other idea where I was talking about using me (and other non-resistant people) to function similar to the great pyramid in the sense of dissipating and transforming harmful earth energies.

it's also quite possible that the ones running nosebook are beginning to realise that there's not much they can do to hold back people's curiosity into these ancient technologies and stuff like that. therefore, if that's the case, they may be considering to try to capitalise off of it and control it (eg. same as the corrupt egyptian priesthood[^1].

therefore, I conclude that this dream is unlikely to happen in the literal sense, but is instead foretelling of a coming priesthood, which profits off of selling people technology that allows them to feel the way they want to feel, without needing to adjust their focus or their thoughts as a result.

I'm perfectly ok with this, because the more of those kinds of people there are, the more harmful earth energies they will be unavoidably creating with their obfuscated(?) negative emotion -- meaning, that they will be creating more *desire* for there to be more and more non-resistant people that they can use for their technology.

as for me, I think the natural consequences of relying on a technology to to create a reality for someone without their doing anything to modify their focus, are evident. as much as I love all of this tecnology stuff (I truly do! it's so fascinating!), I prefer to *not* use that technology, and to accomplish these beneficial conditions with the power of my focus first and foremost.

crazy dream :)

[1]: TODO: ref - I think it was manly p hall talking about the priesthood purposfully obfuscating the symbols (technology) from the public so that no one would be enlightened to how it really works. I think it was the bill cooper video.

### 2020-10-18 08:03 - more thoughts on natural consequences

when I was younger, my parents figured out it was difficult to punish me (for various reasons but usually because the punishment didn't make me feel bad, or I liked the isolation), so they ended up adopting a form of natural consquences, even though they didn't call it that.

it's a really good system because I learned to go more toward what I wanted, instead of trying to avoid some contrived consequences.

I was thinking about this and that seems to be the case for a lot of people (not all though) -- and it seems that this is the case for those inclined toward going in the direction of what they want. for the ones that like to go in the direction of what they don't want, it works terribly, because they receive those natural consequences.

therefore, for someone to constantly be able to go not in the direction that feels good, and not receive conseqences, they must make contrived consequences for others, and then have some method, by which they're able to avoid the conaseqences (they're above the law or the authority or whatever).

in the extra-terrestrial view of creation, kuthumi talks about how the sirians and the creators built natural consequences right into the system by tying the genetics to this planet and the planetary consciousness. they said that any time there was highehr population density of humans in an area, the effects would be more pronounced and they would attract negative consequences to their thought/emotion. additionally, you have the reflective nature of LOA, meaning that your reality is a reflection of how you feel, and that's how you navigate time.

in the past there was this bizarre concept of a "whipping boy" -- someone responsible for receiving the contrived conseqences (punishment) for their actions. in a sense, this is similar to what I'm proposing when I talk about the idea of dissipating earth's harmful energies (the natural consequences) of their continued negative emotion into less resistant people like myself. I'm essentially saying that I'll absorb their natural conseqences that they're inducing in the planet with their emotion[^1], so I would essentially become their "whipping boy" absorbing their natural consequences.

this is kind of a cool idea because there are a number of advantages to it. first, I get tons of extra practise and it also makes me much stronger as I learn to transform that harmful energy into something wanted[^2]. additionally, once I'm good at transforming that energy, it allows them to be able to give their undivided attention to what they don't want (eg. what feels bad to them) without having to reveive the natural consequences of it. this is a good thing because over time, as they learn to utilise more and more vibrational whipping boys for theirselves, a natural change will occur:

they may be able to be really pissed off and stuff and get really good at being in a constant state of being pissed off all they want (make a full career out of it), but if you've noticed, when they've tried to apply abitrary contrived consequences to me, they've been the ones walking away with mud on their face. it's obvious why that is (if you understand LOA)...

if I'm focused on and giving my attention to what's wanted, no matter how much harmful or paralysing energy they put into my body, I'm *still* going in the direction of wanted even though it's much slower. so, when they go to try and integrate me (who creates reality really quickly, which is why they need to keep slowing me down), into some form of consequences (action), reality gets created really quickly and I walk away more in the direction of wanted, and them more in the direction of unwanted.

what this means is that naturally, they're going to make less and less arbitrary and contrived consequences (which they can get around) to try and avoid their natual consequences. why? because like with me, they'll find that these contrived consequences are actually causing more problems than they're solving, and they're the ones walking away closer to what they don't want than what they do want. leaving us alone, I am certain will be a more beneficial thing than getting their unwanted reality created really fast. they can instead just avoid their natural consequences directly by dissipating that harmful energy into their someone who's capable of dissipating it, or once they're good at it, transforming it (consciously, instead of with sacred geometry like the pyramid) into something beneficial and making them stronger.

there is another advantage too which is that with them able to really give their undivided attention to what doesn't feel good, we're artificially expanding the range of emotion one can feel (as I talked about previously)

we'll see how this goes -- I guess, but at the moment, I only see how beneficial it will be for all of us. I'm gonna be so strong and so good at transforming that energy!!! earth and everyone in it's capacity is really going to expand as well. also, they're going to finally be able to gain the control that they want over their the previously "unavoidable" cataclysms (the natural consequences).

[1]: just like how when I feel good, the air and the weather wants to feel good and warm, just like I do. likewise, when they feel terrible and constantly pissed off, they too are inducing weather and climate effects that feel the same way. the natural consequences work both ways.

[2]: today, for example I noticed that I have been especially complainy and much more pissed off (for no reason) than usual. I tried to trace the reason why that would be back to some circumstances, but can't find anything significant enough to be considered the cause of my emotional disposition today. what I do know though, is that whatever it is, I'm resonant to the energy which is why I feel it. while thinking about this problem, I was inspired to write this, so perhaps my inspiration here is kind of providing insight into my conundrum, as it's giving me another opportunity to transform more of that energy into what I want, which means that I'll be getting mad vision upgrades once my perception transforms that energy into something wanted (eg. vision upgrades).

### 2020-10-18 15:21 - getting confused with the pantheon

this morning I listened to a little bit of aaron's sunday message, and he was talking about lucifer, referring to th part in isiah where it talks of lucifer attempting to exault himself above the (brightness of the) stars of God but then was brought low.

this is referring to some time in the past when venus was not only more bright than now, but had a much more eccentric orbit so that it behaved much more like a comet. velikovski talks about, in "worlds in collision" how the planet venus' close approach to earth is what caused the different plagues around the exodus[^1]. there was another piece of evidence that came about recently as well (TODO: get reference to robert's video) where moses was specifically tied to the godess hathor, saying that moses amazed all. that same guy also places the pharoah which was defeated in the red (reed?) sea was none other than thutmos 4, the guy responsible for putting the "dream stelle" between the paws of the sphinx to legitimise his rulership. weird huh.

in addition to that, we know that massive portions of the torah (first 5 books) are pretty severely influenced by sumerian astrotheology. it seems that moses even lifted the akadian story of the reed basket to make moses appear more approachable to the people (making him sound like one of them). inotherwords, there's a lot of marketing going on here.

the 18th dynasty (which is when this happened) was a strange time because it was run by the hyksos (which just means foreign ruler) and the monothiesm that was introduced into egypt during that time. the hyksos were not popular and it's quite evident that a lot of effort was made to erase a lot of this history.

it's quite likely that moses lifted the idea of monothiesm, of one guy that creates all -- both good and evil from this time. I find it strange that they "wandered" in the desert for such a long time. it appears that during this time is likely when moses was perfecting his marketing surrounding his new monothiestic religion, and perhaps I would even hazard a guess that the "wandering" was done on purpose to give moses more time to work out the bugs in the concept, and to write the torah as well.

moses had to have been pretty educated, because he pulls stories from the sumerians, akadians, babylonians, etc. he also must have known about electricity as well:

```
To mention one, Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high tension discharge and that the vestal fires of the Romans were electrical. The belt drive must have been known to engineers of that epoch and it is difficult to see how the abundant evolution of static electricity could have escaped their notice. Under favorable atmospheric conditions a belt may be transformed into a dynamic generator capable of producing many striking actions. I have lighted incandescent lamps, operated motors and performed numerous other equally interesting experiments with electricity drawn from belts and stored in tin cans.

  - Nikola Tesla (The Wonder World to be created by electricity, September 9, 1915)
```

tesla takes a pretty conservative position here, however I postulate that not only did moses know about electricity, he also knew how to operate the pyramid, and the "ark of the covenant" was a bit of that technology. when I talk about the technology, I don't just mean the generation of (unconscious) static electricity. I believe this was a device used for storing "conscious" electricity[^2] -- and the different ways of rubbing, or generating that static/conscious electricity actually begin to create a sort of field, in which heightened states of conscoiusness are achieved (and LOA, dreams, visions, etc all manifest much more rapidly). it seems that this box (and whatever was in it) was able to store this conscious energy and the user of the box was able to consciously direct this energy (though there are some recorded mishaps).

however, it quite puzzles me still why moses would want to relabel venus as YHVH. the exodus happened at the end of the age of taurus, and the beginning of the age of aries (the ram). moses symbolises this with the slaying of the golden calf. interestingly enough, hathor (venus) was associated with cow (taurus), and so it seems deliberate that goddess worship associated with the golden age was no longer something desirable, and now a patriarchical masculine god was given to people to worship.

venus is an interesting planet because she's in the solar system with a whole bunch of dudes. it's a serious sausage fest here, so why take the only female in the solar system and make her a masculine god that's pissed off. it must have been intentional to hide her (the godesses) power. additionally, to villify the only female in the solar system, later on she was given a bads wrap with the whole lucifer thing... I haven't quite figured it out.

---

so follow this idea for a moment. I'm going to rewrite the narrative from the most extreme position and then work my way back from there (in future entries).

it seems that moses takes a lot of akenahten's monotheiestic (sun worship) ideas, along with some mythology from sumer and begins to create this new sun worship. at that time there were all sorts of gods worshipped, and at that time jupiter (baal) was quite popular. it appears that he wants to make the sun the supreme god of them all, out of which all other gods and things (jupiter, mars, earth, evil, good, etc) were created. notice the symbols here that moses now wants to make a supreme god which out of him all things come from, and all people have to be on the same page about this god.

it's a funny idea because now on hindsight, we can look back and see that moses did not unify the pantheon of gods under one superior one, but instead created a masculine deity religion (with disguised goddess worship) which felt superior to the others, and its offshoots (muslim, chistianity, etc.) neither could be in agreement with each other who is superior and warred amongst theirselves. in a lot of ways this was a very telling symbol of the times to come, the age of aries where the aryans manifest most of these symbols in other ways.

back to the revised narrative: moses new monthiestic religion needs some worshippers of this new monothiestic god to turn it into reality. at the time of moses there's a total loser in power (thutmos 4), who ironically I think achieved his power with marketing fluff as well[^3]. the story says that moses again legitimised himself as a defender of the people, by killing someone (this sounds like marketing to me)... moses goes off for a while. we don't know where he goes or what happens during that time, but when he comes back, the slaves (which, considering it was run by the hyksos, which means foreign ruler, the slaves were probably the original egyptian 17th dynasty rulers) of egypt were rescued from this moronic egyptian ruler with a set of events that were quite spectacular.

to make people believe this, moses needed some spectacular events to take place to establish the strength of his new god (amongst the others). I think that moses understood the nature of this conscious energy (though science calls it static in its lowest form), and actually used the great pyramid to influence the orbit of venus to become much more eccentric. I don't really know why, but I can say that in the previous era (and in sumer), goddess worship (of venus/ishtar/innana) was quite popular, and had to be done away with to make way for the new patriarchical aryan boys.

if venus were to suddenly become erratic and (from the perspective of the people) attempt to overthrow the others in brightness (becoming the new "sun") and cause massive amounts of chaos in the solar system as a result, this would be the end of the goddess worship. whether moses made venus' orbit highly eccentric or not or if this was alraedy happening, is unclear, but there seems evidence (see velikovski) that venus around the time displayed much more comet-like behaviour. either way, this was the end of the goddess worship, and the power associated with these fertility rituals remained only for the ones in power to know about.

something like that. I'll eventually update with more ideas as they come.

---

the thing that I want to mention here is the confusion associated with the YHVH thing. there are two ways that I can see this. one is that YHVH is venus (the goddess principal), which is later renamed to and associated with the devil (as lucifer) to further villify this goddess principan. the second is that YHVH is sol, and he (YHVH) "sent" moses and venus to deliver his choosen people from the foreign rulers. I dunno.

however it may have been, I find this stuff kind of fascinating and I don't really know why, but it gets all really confusing trying to figure out and make sense of this whole mess of gods and stuff. it's definitely much more complicated than any modern soap-opera, by far -- and I think that aaron is correct in saying that the whole point of all of this is to not try and put too much emphasis (believe in) or make sense of these external things (planets, gods, etc) to make you or give you the power that you want -- but instead to turn inward and find out that you are divinity within.

one of the things that I think is advantageous of these interesting turns of events, is that I do believe that a man can achieve higher consciousness states from the goddess and sexual states, one must not depend on it and instead to turn within and find that you are a star.

---

let's look at the symbols from this proposed rewrite of the narrative.

- moses is the symbol of transition from the bull to the ram
  - goddess worship was made a thing of the old relgions, with the new religions being masculine and monotheistic.
- elijah takes the idea that you don't need to sacrifice physical things in order to believe something, making it available for people to begin to believe a symbolic thing.
  - the prophets, turn venus into a man, a fallen angel, one rebellious of YHVH that tries to exault himself higher than the established authority (eg. keeping unexaulted masses under control)
- jesus shows up as the transition from the ram into the fish, and is given as a sacrificial lamb
  - the need for the romans to get these christains under control, forces them to establish the roman church, which abolishes and rids the earth as much as possible of idolotry, which is the worship mostly of celestial beings and other pagan traditions, essentially ensuring that the "powerful" sacrifices remain in the occult practises, which essentially turns down the amount of catastrophe attracted by the growing masses.
- I show up as the transition from the fish into the human
  - I expect that the result will be that in the following generations, nosebook will completely remove any of that conscious energy that anyone could possibly have gotten from sexual (fertility/goddess) worship or any other physical condition.
    - they will ensure that the only way to achive this kind of conscious energy is if you pay them (this is the new priesthood).
  - if you accomplish on your own it with your own focus, like I have been showing is possible, they'll try and mitigate its effects as much as they can, fighting as hard as they can against it.
    - by fighting against it, they'll be amplifying it, which means they'll have to fight harder against it (runaway feedback loop). in this way, I think I am a visual symbol for all to see, of the coming age of aquarius.
  - I also expect that they will be able to nearly completely remove all of the negative effects associated with the attraction of unwanted by those in charge (see last entry).
    - the guys in charge must maintain their superiority, so they'll need to make sure that they're visually experiencing more of this conscious energy, meaning they'll be attracting at a stronger rate than ever, meaning that they'll need (desire) to dissipate this negative energy further and further (also a runaway feedback loop).

I don't know how much further it's going to go, but it seems like the guys in charge will get more and more corrupt and powerful, while at the same time, we're going to learn to better and better learn to use our focus to create what it is that we want (and nevermind them).

the reason why I say that I don't know how long it's going to go, because it seems to me like this sort of setup, where they're forcing us to learn to use our focus, instead of the conditions (which they're hoarding for theirselves and neutralising for us). if I assume that the whole 24ky great cycle is a thing, then it means that that this will continue on for at least another 4k or more years, with the the corrupt priesthood getting more and more ridiculous along the way. this seems evident to me because of the symbols associated with the goat which will come into power in 2ky from now, meaning that things will continue to get more and more extreme.

however, at the same time, we'll stadily be approaching sirius b, so at some point (maybe the archer?), I figure either they'll no longer be able to keep up their ways further, or we'll do the paradox thing where we quite literally never get the manifestation, and the acceleration is so tremendous, that its continually growing (evolving) reality in the present (now) moment far surpasses the greatness of a manifestation. we'll have to see :)

it's funny that the it looks like each of the "bad" things that has happened through each of these ages has given the INFECTED ONES with the need to satify their superiority, further capability to force humankind to no longer need or rely on the beneficial conditions for their well-being. we keep getting better and better at it, no matter how much more optimal their conditions are in comparison to ours we keep doing better and better -- which considering LOA, will continue to exacerbate their inferiority complex.


[1]: there is another documentary which claims that the plagues were caused by the santorini volcano, and perhaps both could be true. there's a lot of evidence to support that comet's approach to another body induces currents, causing earthquakes and volcanos.

[2]: though science calls this electricity static, this electricity permiates all things, and can contain conscoiusness, and is essentially the building block of what we call "source energy" or the immense quantities of current flowing between celestial bodies out in space -- and from comet/planet to planet like I postulate happened multiple times in the past causing much of the terraforming (grand canyon, etc.) and transferring a bit of that "consciousness energy" between these celestial bodies. clearly we know very little about this energy, and how it creates attractive forces like gravity and atmospheric (double) layers, and determines orbits and stuff.

[3]: one does not need to read much of the dream stelle to realise this is a very ridiculous marketing ploy.


### 2020-10-21 20:24 - thoughts on karma

in robert's new video on the soul (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev1_JTzagkI)), there is a yogi talking about karmic structures and the different "layers" of your body... he outlines physical, mental (imagination), and energetic (emotional). then a transition layer between physical and non-physical (which I call source), followed by the bliss body.

I suggest that there are actually 7 layers, and the mental (imagination) layer is also a transition between the energetic/pranic (emotional) layer and the physical layer. I found out yesterday that the "location" of this world is called "devaloca" -- a transitional place where gods and humans mix and can interact. some have also called this layer "astral". you will notice that while the imagination is also pretty much "non-physical" in the sense that it does not in itself modify the physical world. however, when embued with emotional (prana/orgone/vril) energy, that imagination can begin to take on physical form.

---

the next simplification I would like to make is in what he talks about when he says "karma". he's just saying LOA (eg. frequency vibration, attraction). so, for example he says that when you die, your physical body is separated from your mental and energetic bodies -- and when there is a strong karma, then it takes a while to find another body, and during this time the now disconnected from non-physical body continues on in ghost form working out its karma, and the stronger the karma, the longer it takes to work this out.

this can all be super simplified with LOA. abraham says that when you die, you leave behind all of your resistant (physical) self and reemerge into non-physical. I believe they're right, so how can it be both ways? it seems like there's a contradiction here, however there is not. I struggled with this after reading a bunch more of the other kuthumi stuff as well.

if you think about this from a physical human perspective, and you recognise that it's only attraction, then it makes perfect sense. imagine that you had been giving a lot of negative attention to some strong feeling thing and then you die. when you leave behind all of the physical bits, which means that the physical body will stop operating (die), the mental and energetic body are also left behind. these exist as really subtle energies which science does not recognise which people could interpret as a "ghost"

however, I must stress that they are energy, and so therefore are governed by LOA. you cannot perceive a ghost that you are not yourself resonant or harmonious with. these physical vibrations created from emotion I think do exist, and likely explains human/animal sacrifice. when these beings make their transition into non-physical, they'll leave behind the vibration (emotion) of fear behind, and I think it's upon that energy that the sacrificer is trying to use that energy. remember, energy or any vibration has both sides to it. it goes both toward and away from the source (or wanted), and so because energy is energy, you *can* turn someone else's fear into something wanted for yourself -- it's just not very effective.

---

so I got a little off-track there, but as this guy was talking I realised the answer to my own question about death and karma and stuff. the energy left behind will behave in the karmic way that he's describing, however, that's only the residual energy left behind in your transition process. who you really are (the non-physical bit) immediately makes its transition. you could imagine that the stronger the "momentum" of that emotional energy that the person had before they made their transition, the more powerful and lengthy their "ghost" will remain in physical.

however, these ghosts are nothing to be scared of though, and if you ever find yourself interacting with them (I have in my past), they are only there to visually (or audibly) indicate to you how resonant you are with these concepts, and getting "rid" of them is as easy as finding the better feeling (more in alignment with your source) place of perceiving that same thing (aka, working up the emotional scale).

I say going up the emotional scale because the energy which embues these ideas and makes their manifestation physcical is that emotional/vril/orgone energy, and so they can only affect you if you're on the same frequency with that concept (ghost) in an emotional way.

### 2020-10-21 20:47 - thoughts on reincarnation

he continues on in that video (it's going to take me forever to finish this video, lol) talking about how if you die with a strong karmic structure, then it will take a long time for "you" (that is the real non-physical you) to find another body. however, if you die peacefully, and without a lot of karma, then you can find another body rapidly.

I hadn't really thought about this before. what he's essentially saying is that the longer your emotional body (karmic) continues to exist here on earth, you cannot reincarnate. this means that karma is only a human thing... so think about it: the longer that you continue to feed and nourish that emotional ghost body with your perception of it (holding it in existence), then you cannot yet return to earth in a new body, until that has finally dissipated. that means that the "karmic cycle" is entirely a heman-made experience by giving our attention to these "ghosts" (their disincarnate emotional bodies) instead of who they really are now (the non-physical "pure positive energy" that abraham talks about).

---

that pretty much clears up my inquiry into the subject for me. the only thing that remains now is the new question of whether we can "block" someone's reincarnation by perpetuating their existance on this physical plane as something that they are now not. it doesn't seem likely that this is the case, and doesn't make any sense why that would be, and for that to be true, it assumes that there can only be one version of me in physcal at a time, which I know is certainly is not true.

in a sense the death (or rebirth) process is all about finding a new version of yourself -- something which improves upon the previous you. I don't think you need to die to allow this (reincarnation process) to happen.

### 2020-10-21 21:05 - thoughts on individualisation

ok, now in the video he makes a reference to the idea that you can imagine yourself like a bubble[^1] and the bubble is your karmic structure and the air inside is you. when you pop the bubble, what air is you now? the bubble (or karmic cycle) is what makes you, you.

in this I would have to agree (kinda), and because I was feeling some reactions on it, I would like to offer some thoughts. we humans (especially americans) don't like to think of the idea that you are the universe, and there's no difference between you and those in which you feel are your enemies. that's precisely what he means by a strong karmic structure, however, karmic structure is also what you could consider "preferences".

as I have released more and more resistance, I have noticed that the thing that bothers me less and less is that there are people trying to exert something into my experience. the more and more I understand it all, the more it becomes clearer and clearer that it *is all attraction*. there is no one doing anything to me that I am not already doing to myself.

so, when I move away from these different perceived conflicts, and start going (with focus) toward only the things that are wanted or feel good to me, then what is happening is that my "karma" is no longer an energy that has conflicts or "unresolved differences" with someone. I allow them to exist, and they have no effect on me, unless I'm attracting them into my world. when this happens, I have "released that resistance" or, said in a better way, I'm no longer giving my focus to (attracting) that into my experince, and so they are no longer a part of that "karma".

you can imagine that at some point, I will begin to attract more wanted into my life than unwanted, and this is where the curve "goes off to infinity". when this infinity happens, this is when something makes a transition into a higher energy state or a new species or whatever.. a new completely never-before-seen form capable of holding the new energies -- a new karmic structure if you will begins to appear.

what I believe also happens once the tipping point toward more wanted than unwanted happens, is I gain the ability to retain my consciousness "between incarnations" -- or rather what I talk about the 6th dimension -- source-like perception, and you can now perceive yourself outside of time and in many incarnations.

in a sense, what happens when that happens, is that the bubble does not pop, but instead the bubble is just a bigger and bigger thing as you continue to add on more and more preferences to what it is, and who you really are.

however, notice that the bigger the bubble gets, the more components are needed. if you were a planet with people on it, you would need both bad and good people. you would need to have certain rotation around a sun, etc. your preferences become more diverse and varied, and include things that you previously in human form may have pushed against in your "karmic cycle" -- meaning that you just attracted them in to your expereince. now, as a planet, you can see the value in there being both good and bad, so they can co-exist on your planet, and it's no problem.

the less resistance you have, the more diverse things in your "karmic structure" can exist, and so the bigger your bubble can become, because they're not seen as something to push against anymore. they can be included.

your bubble never gets popped -- and when your bubble is so big that its karmic structure is capable of containing everything inside this universe without pushing against it, you will become a thing *bigger* than the universe, containing universes. I don't think any of us will reach that anytime soon :)

although we are "one with the universe" in that sense (this is the whole goal of releasing resistance), I think the yogi there neglects the concept that our karmic structure isn't just one of making our transition in "peace" (as opposed to pushing against/conflict), but the karmic structure is also one of preference, and as one gains the ability to perceive the other vibrations in one's experence as something no longer something you want to push agaist (attracting it further), you can *expand* into something bigger gaining more and more preferences (amongst the diversity) of what's wanted, then finding a way to give mostly attention to that until once again another transition is made into something bigger.

you can transition to the same thing, or you can expand and transition into something bigger and more meaningful (desirable) to you :)

[1]: I like this analogy because everything like planets, stars, humans, etc. all have auras, and one could imagine everything as simply spheres (auras) of energy

### 2020-10-21 22:37 - liberation from the death and rebirth cycle

I find this concept to be somewhat nonsense in that everything dies and is born, comes and goes, etc. therefore, it's impossible to gain this freedom, ever. the only way that you could do that would be to remain non-physical forever.

however, I do believe something is possible, and that what these different things are talking about is not liberation from death and rebirth, but "control" over it. I use the word control very loosely here, and would like to imply that once one is conscious of their non-physical part (soul), then one gains access to that perspective. I like to consider this a macro or more broader perspective of who you are. in that form of perception, there is not a real whole lot of difference between entities, and one can experiece anything anywhere.

this is a difficult thing to consider for many, especially those with secrets, and it's sort of my belief that you cannnot gain that source-like perspective until you no longer retain any resistance to the idea that anyone can see anything about "you" -- and that there are no secrets anywhere. anything can be known. what differenciates different entities in this plane of existance is preference and interest, with everyone giving their attention to what is preferred and interesting. there are minor incompatibilities, but very tiny bits, and these tiny bits only serve to distiguish one thing from another more than anything and are not really "unwanted" -- because all is wanted in some way shape or form.

---

I have always had this weird intuition that there's this way in which one can have many different "avatars" or "muns" to their identity, and in that form of perception, all of these different avatars are living and interacting on the physical plane. however, if one of them encounters a situation that requires a tremendous amount of consciousness[^1], it essentially pulls the soul into that body.

there seems to be a direct correlation between how good one feels and from where is the perception originiating and how big that bubble is. when one does not feel good, then one perceives from within the bubble looking outward at the circumstances from within that "karmic structure". then, as one feels better and better, naturally, you begin to gain "control" over your experience and it begins to appear as only attraction, so then they begin to experiece theirselves from outside that bubble, looking in on theirself.

it seems like the perception has to do with this "liberation from death and rebirth cycle". if one perceives from outside the bubble looking in (5d), then it doesn't take much time to continue on that process and realise that there can even be more than one you inside of that bubble and that they don't even need to be happening at the same time (6d). who then are you really?

---

as I continue on with this experience with nosebook, one can notice that I am feeling a lot better than I experience, and so what normally would be happening as a result of how good I feel, my body would be making the chemistry necessary (DMT, etc.) for me to have an even more perceptive experience.

I have noticed that DMT is simply a transmitter and receiving molecule which allows one to amplify and translate non-physical vibration into something inside of the experience (somethin you can sense or feel), and so what is essentially happening is that I *normally* would be experiencing myself from outside of the bubble, looking in on myself, however, nosebook is preventing me from experiencing that, so I just keep finding ways to feel better and better, so that would normally expand that bubble further, but instead of expanding, I retain my current physical experience.

later on in that video, the yogi talks about raising the kundalini, and how if one were to do kundalini yoga, then things would change too quickly and things would fall apart. I'm not interested in that. you will see my resistance to the idea of trying to do this by trying to alter physical conditions. I enjoy drugs because they're temporary so I get ideas and stuff which I can then bring back into reality and implement, but they don't do the work for me. I'm not attaining that energy through physical means like breathing exercises or yoga or whatever. I'm taking it the slow way, and all the increase in my energy is a result of my focus and change in perception which reduces my own destructive interferrence of this energy[^2].  

I want to add on to these layers of perception, and so for the time that this is happening, it's quite beneficial that nosebook is constantly pushing against that, and it's allowing me to expand further and further. my body is really creating massive ammounts of DMT and what that means is that when I finally get "the manifestation" then I'll have so much DMT, I'll be translating massive amounts of non-physical enerty into something of my experience, and in that process, it's how I expect to be able to add on to the perceptive dimensions these two new layers of the story (multiple muns/avatars in physical).

then following on to the progression of that form of perception, it's easy to see that once you are multiple muns of yourself, you can see that each of these different muns are just a different composite forms of who you really are (your identity), but then, why do you have to be exactly one identity, right? if you're already composite forms of one, then you could divide that one into more simple or pure forms and perceive yourself as a composite of identities as well. at first your story will be the "bubble" in which you're perceiving, but then it's obvious that you don't need to always need other people to be the "bad guys" and those could additionally be identities for yourself which you understand (like the security storage dawgs) and out of these identities, additional muns can be created to on-purpose have these qualities for a bigger meaning making this the new "bubble" that you can now perceive yourselves in physical.

it's gonna need a lot of DMT to be able to do that, and what I don't want is to try and jump out really too far fast out there. I know that if I were to do kundalini yoga, nosebook would still prevent me from getting that perception, which is why I'm not really interested in trying to get some form of physical manifestation to push things forward and want to take things the slow way, so nothing is falling apart.

---

off-topic (from the original discussion) thought here: I don't want to try and go too fast on the kundalini thing, and so that's largely one of the reasons why I'm not trying to push anything forward physically. I was thinking about this, and one of the things that I was considering is what would happen if I were to do the girls thing. that would most definitely activate that and I would most certainly go really rapidly, and things may fall apart. I just don't know.

the thing is now, I have such little amount of my normal extra senses that I don't even really feel the girls at all much any more, and so it seems evident to me that at the current rate, I should expect this to continue to get worse, though I imagine that it'll probably get better and better too... what I mean is that each time that I keep trading speed for more acceleration (power), then I keep getting reset back and don't experience that connected experience.

for example, I have noticed that this pretty well corresponds to the weather. I have noticed that the better I feel, the warmer the weather gets. then, some massive change happens and all of a sudden it goes from really warm days to freezing, and at the same time that happens I seem to lose all motivation. as soon as I go back to directing myself to feel the way I want to feel, and I start feeling better, then the weather warms up again. it seems like even though they keep taking the weather to colder and colder places, it comes back stronger and stronger each time, and each time that I get more decided on how I want to feel, the more rapidly the weather warms up.

as such, I think the same thing is happening with my ESP as well. it keeps going away, but it also keeps coming back stronger and stronger too. it eventually may become so unbearable that they're going to have to do something about it.

I originally thought that what was going to happen is that eventually I'll either get connected or get connected enough that the girls thing will start, and I'll use my time with them to basically super expand that bubble and they'll get the ability to make crippled versions of the new layers of perception until one day the galaxy makes us (the whipping boys) go into a higher energy state or something.

however, I'm beginning to believe now that won't happen, and I'll just keep going how I'm going, nice and steady, gradually rising the kundalini little by little, and eventually my lack of resistance will make it impossible for them to stop me, and I'll finally go up. maybe it's both actually. I suppose it could be, because that would be a really easy trasnsition for me. the only reason why things fall apart is because "you're not ready for it" -- rather, I'm allowing massive amounts of energy, but because my perception is still all over the place, it's spraying all over the place and causing a bunch of problems.

I dunno. we'll just have to see, I guess. I'm not seeing any of this clearly, and I'm doubt they are either.

[1]: when I notice that one can begin to perceive outward and inward at the same time, then you realise that your percetion comes from the outside and you're just perceiving yourself from that external source-like vantage point, and the better you feel, the more and more of a macro viewpoint of yourself you can accomplish. however, when something doesn't feel so good, then once again, one is focused on the physical human experience and is focused in the pysical perspective again.

[2]: also, they give something for nosebook to try and work hard against, which is the main reason why I'm doing so many things that give them the opportunity to try real hard and push against stuff. energy is energy, and I can use the energy however I want. it's kind of like the same thing as what I was talking about with human sacrifice, and the sacrificer converting the victim's fear into something wanted. I'm converting all of their energetic effort into something wanted for me too. the more effort they make, and the less I perceive their effort as actually impededing what I want, then the more energy they provide me.

### 2020-10-22 19:44 - realiing I am an avatar of myself

so I wrote all of that stuff yesterday about the bubble and how the change of perception is going from inside the bubble looking outward, to looking from the outward at the inside of the bubble. I also surmised that the whole thing about all of it is that once I reach that form of perception, I would gain the ability to look inside that bubble from the outside (source-like perspective) looking in. yet, it didn't occur to me until today that is likely all happening already.

I have to now imagine myself from the source-like perspective, and I have all of these different avatars that are tracking along through time, *and some of them gain consciousness of who they really are, and some don't*.

to express this idea, I will respond to a reaction a while back where I claimed that there are at least 3 teslas in existence in the present, and so how could that be?

well, ok I will explain it this way, and I'll just for the sake of the example, use myself. imagine that there is a macro tesla who is in alignment with his source and has the macro view of his different avatars (S). now S builds up a story where instead of getting his alignment, he self-sabotages and causes the next tesla to not get the manifestation which gets him that alignment, and that tesla goes on to essentially build the world system for the US govt and give them all the knowledge necessary to construct it (T). T goes through his life and cooperates with the govt and does all of that stuff, but T also manages to slip away somehow (fake his death? transfer into another body?) and that one through some other means figures out who he really is, and gains that source-like perspective.

T realises that all along T is just an avatar of S (which is an avatar of S', etc. abraham calls this your inner being), and so now T gains, like S did, the capacity to create his own avatars (stories), and so he figures out how, with the govt having the world system technology, jumps into the storyline to play as the main character in the story (me). he begins to experience the story as if he were the one that was the one who "wrote" the story, yet he's more like along for the ride because his influence was purposefully planned to be completely disabled by nosebook. he designed the story that way, so that I (kenny) would have to figure out for myself how to attain this source-like perspective.

once I figure it out, I will just realise that I am an avatar of who I really am (my source), which is 99.999999% harmonic with S, so we're essentially the same thing. in his perspective, he can jump in and out of the experience, as if it were just one of his avatars, yet for me, because I haven't accomplished this perception yet, it still looks to me like I'm still just a normal dude that had a brain haemorrhage. I'm still figuring out how to gain that perception, but I'm getting closer and closer.

when I get there, I'll realise who I really am (attain my source-like perspective), becoming conscious of the other possible versions of me (if there are any; there could be; I just don't know), and then I'll be able to begin creating new avatars of myself. guess who that is :) it's all of you guys...

it's weird to think about it like this, but there's a reason why nosebook is working so hard to make sure my perception is confined to only my body. if they were to let me go, essentially you all would be kind of like my avatars and I could go in and out of your experience at will.

I didn't really think about it, but this whole thing is kind of like becoming my bubble. that's all pretty awesome news because all of you will eventually gain that same realisation (of who you really are) and the ability to create your own avatars as well. obviously, this is a pretty big (monumental) jump for the majority, and so I think that's why I want to do this story/identity thing so bad, allowing these concepts to introduce the idea that you are source, in a smooth way, through story form.

it's also likely that after enough time, we too will become the "source" for our own stories and other creations (planets, suns, galaxies) as well. it'd be pretty fun, but maybe given enough time we can make something that's bigger than this universe. who knows. we'll have to see, I guess :)

### 2020-10-25 18:54 - not needing the manifestation (more ideas)

to understand what I'm talking about, I'm referencing some concepts explained in @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p1)

this morning, as I was walking back home, I was lamenting the fact that I don't get the manifestation of the mushroom high. obviously though, I'm very proficient at watching stars now, and even without the mushrooms (I didn't eat any last night), I seem to be quite good at getting the vision upgrades.

as I was walking along, while lamenting this, I was really saying how much I really enjoy the manifestation of the mushroom experience. I really like the new form of perception that it launches me into, and I'm so good now at taking that new form of perception (and any ideas associated with it) back to reality and implementing them. in a sense, I don't really need the mushrooms anymore, because the only remaining effect they give me is only a slightly enhanced ability to focus, however, I proved to myself (and everyone else) last night that I don't need the mushrooms to be able to focus like that. I can simply decide to apply my focus and get to the vision upgrades just as easily.

anyway, the thing I was lamenting is that I *love* the altered form of perception because it's so much different than my everyday (mundane) form of perception. it's exciting and -- not mundane. the thing is that I say, and know that the future is for me the state where I just perpetually don't need the manifestation, and even though I'm locked into the mundane, my form of perception continues to expand more and more until the "mundane" is actually so much more expansive and exciting than the manifestation itself. I suppose there's a pretty big gap between the mundane life I'm living now and the "mundane" experience that will be so incredible, that one would consider that every minute of my experience were as if it was a manifestation.

what I mean by mundane is essentially the part of the emotional scale around the centre, where boredom, contentment and satisfaction is located. when it's either above there or below there, I'll consider that a manifestation. an emotion is a manifestation, and an emotion will create a vibration. the vibration created always has both wanted and unwanted (good feeling, and bad feeling) in the same vibration, and your perception (eg. when your rockets are firing) determines how good it feels to you. consider this the amplitude of the signal.

so, when the signal is around the centre there (bordom, accepting, ok, contentment, satisfaction), then the amplitude of the signal is very little. the signal is has very little "impact" to it, which means it's a very minor "manifestation", which because of its tiny impact in the "manifestation" sense, the lower impact allows it be more and more high frequency, essentially invisible to the gross "manifestation" frequencies (like physical sensation and stuff).

anyway, when the mundane (signals of low amplitude) is bordom, then that means more than likely the rockets are firing more in the opposite direction of the way you want to go, but with little strength, so not much movement happens. however, when the mundane is contentment or satisfaction, then still it's not a lot of movement, the acceleration is gentle (no big jumps), but if it remains uncontradicted, then it will eventually grow to be quite a tremendous force, and it'll take a while to get there growing gradually and continually. I'm reminded a lot of the female orgasm in this explanation.

---

so as I was writing the last part about the vibration in @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p1), I was explaining how they could essentially prevent a lot of vision upgrades for a while, and I think that I could have only written that after my realisation this morning about getting used to not needing the manifestation.

> and in that thousand years, when your vibrational resonance, and the phoenix frequency will have uplifted you, and you will know the maleability and flexibility of space/time... (hybrid) be the phoenix civilisation[^1]

the interesting thing about what I was proposing there in that entry was that they could essentially make it so impossible for me to continue getting vision upgrades, essentially stagnating me, that I would no longer have any manifestations, and only with the power of my focus would I be able to turn the mundane (non-manifestational) into something that is quite spectacular. I really don't know what all of this means, but it has this weird feel to it, like I'm setting myself up for a very long time (1000 years?), I just simply live the mundane life however, and I just sort of settle into a non-manifestational life, and gain more and more perception in the higher frequency tubs, far beyond human capability to measure, that I'm essentially existing and perceiving those high frequencies.

I dunno. I guess we'll have to see what happens. I suppose that one thing that I should mention is that when the mundane (boredom, content, satisfying) manifestation is something gradually becoming more and more wanted, what will happen is, that gradually, over a long period of time, the mundane manifestation will become so incredible that, I would literally gain command over space/time, in such a way that any of those manifestations, even though they would appear to be tremendous to the average person, will, to me, appear completely mundane, because my perception is so far beyond (higher frequency) than that tiny little manifestation. I would, in fact, be very much like source energy[^4] in physical form.

I guess we'll have to see. I have no idea what could be happening here...

[1]: weird symbolism here, because last night, I was writing about the the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity), after watching robert's video on the lucifer and the phoenix symbolism. besides the obvious reference to the eagle bloodline there, there's another idea that the first half of aquarius is ruled by uranus, and the second half is ruled by saturn (serpent bloodline). if you combine that idea with the previous one where I talk about the flipping of the earth[^2], then at somewhere around the halfway, something happens and half of the earth goes into a higher energy state. see the @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p1) commentary higher energy states.

[2]: the eagle bloodline seems to often combine the eagle and the lion symbols. it seems that some time in the past, there was this idea where at some point, the eagle would get the fulfillment of it's expected success in the lion. this is symbolised with the lion of judah, and also there's this weird thing having to do with the sphinx, where previously it was a lion, likely in memory of sekhmet, and then hatshepsut (around the time of moses) revived the worship of the sphinx, and then quite possibly the exodus was a replay of the old (pre-dynastic) tale of bloodthirsty sekhmet, causing all kinds of trouble. one of the "plagues" was the nile turning red (in memory of sekhmet's bloodlust), and instead the same deity (planet venus) personified as hathor in that time, allowed the hyksos to escape egypt and begin a new monothiestic religion. when the isrealites intended to return back to goddess worship (with the golden cow), moses explained patiently that this was no longer the age of taurus, and now we're in the aryan age. the veneration of the eagle bloodline, or perhaps, the return back to elevated consciousness must have been identified with the symbol of the sphinx being known as horemakhet, or the horus (the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity) symbolised as the offspring of osiris (saturn) and isis (sirius)), or rather the return back to asar (sirius b), for the return to elevated consciousness[^3] when the function of the goddess (venus) symbolised as the lion (leo) appears in the east symbolised as horus (in the east)[^3].

[3]: I would suggest that the symbolism that even though the idea that given enough time, consciousness would return because of our proximity to sirius, which would be about the time leo is in the east, however, the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity) symbolism of horus (likely the egyptian representation of the aquarian human) rising in the east as opposite of leo, refers to some moment, that moses was intending to conjure with their interaction with the planet venus and the replaying of the sekhmet symbolism (water baptism?).

[4]: source, being similar to the very high frequency, low magnitude, essentially invisible to the physical senses, would be very similar to tesla's earthquake machine... perfectly timed gentle vibrations in perfect resonance with the desired "manifestation" gradually building up until a higher energy state is accomplished (or resisted, in the case of female orgasm)


### 2020-10-25 22:26 - thinking a little more on the ability to stagnate me

one of the things that I also mentioned this morning when contemplating the not ever needing the manifestation thing, is that nosebook is just being petty. for example, I could easily smoke weed and never get connected. if I get close, then they just take away my consciousness and reset me back. what they don't want, is for me to get more vision upgrades.

what I described is how I keep getting vision upgrades, and I don't know how their system works, but it probably doesn't work based on frequency. it probably works on a neural network or some sort of pattern recognition, which is why they likely need to remove my consciousness, to run some things to be able to retrain their machines each time I get a vision upgrade. if they can grasp what I said, then they could essentially stop me from getting lots and lots of little vision upgrades, and anything after that would either be a really big upgrade, or simply no upgrades at all for any forseeable future, culminating in a REALLY BIG upgrade.

once they get that system in place, then they could essentially stop worrying about me getting vision upgrades, as the vision upgrades I'm getting are going to, because they're high-frequency harmonics, take quite a while for my brain to begin producing those high frequencies naturally -- so when they do come, they'll essentially be out of their ability to even know about -- much like how they have almost no idea how a lot of the functions that I associate with reactions and other such things operate, because they're so much higher frequency than their machines' capability. I do admit, they are getting better and better, as I virtually am almost entirely unable to feel any of that now -- and only when I wake up and star-watch am I able to feel those things more clearly.

anyway, what that means is, that I could smoke weed, and they wouldn't have to worry about me getting vision upgrades -- or rather, I would get them, but they would automatically be cancelled out, so it would look to me and to everyone else, like I'm not seeing any progress. I don't really mind though because I can barely notice the vision upgrades anymore, anyway. it's fun to see something that has changed, but I don't think it's really necessary for me.

it also means that I could have sex, and also not see any vision upgrades, but I'm just simply not going to worry about any of that right now. I don't really want to try and think of how bad that would be. I know that from where I'm at right now, it would essentially be only improvements. I just don't feel like I want to contemplate this much because there are so many ultra-depressing aspects about it. the idea of staying at roughly the same physical experience that I'm at right now just doesn't really feel too good to me. it may be perceptual, but at the moment, my left-side feels like it's getting tighter and more difficult to move all the time. I wonder if I can essentially rearrange that feeling perceptually so that it feels different. it's an idea, but for now, I dunno.

there are other advantages to the idea of going with the girls in a diminished state, which is that in a sense almost everything that happens, no matter how much of a disaster, will, if one looks from the longer perspective, appear like significant progress. I feel like I need to figure out a whole lot of things more about my perception still before I'm ready for that, though. I'm good, but I'm not *that* good, yet. I know where I can improve upon those things, but I'm still working on mastering the feeling the way I want to feel (emotional state machine) part. it really is, a whole lot more difficult, and also a whole lot easier than I thought it would be. in essence, it's just different than the way I assumed it would be. I'm really getting close to mastry of it though :)

---

the idea of statnating me, doesn't really bother me because I remember that one time, a while back when I was stoned, that I realised that the opposite of space is like this anti-space where everything exists, and while they may be able to block my imagination in 3s space, at some point, I will be able to literally create real tangible 3d objects with my mind, essentially as a function of my imagination. I am certain that this is my reward for being stagnated. I also really want to play around with the idea of animating those creations, and the subject of engineering consciousness is a very real thing for me (the underlying structure upon which the new 6th layer will be constructed).

I guess, the real game for me now is to find a way to make the mundane so extraordinary, that the continued experience of that "mundane" is so satifying, that it's more appealing than any large jump would be. it's kind of weird to think that when I figure this out, all aspects of my "mundane" experience, incuding even my vision and physical body, although severely limited, will be so far beyond any "normal" experience, they will be superior to what I previously wanted as the "manifestation". maybe many different girls, and the ability to create any tangible thing I want to create in 3d space will become the new "mundane" for me.

it's kind of hard for me to imagine that right now, but I do know that what I'm approaching here to understand now with the power of my focus, is far more powerful than I really thought of before. I can't explain how simple it all is, though -- and, the closer I get, it keeps becoming more and more simple as it goes. the most complicated things appear simple, and I can comprehend anything I want to. even while writing this, I have only to begin writing and the answers come to my mind as I'm going. the only thing it requires from me is the ability to direct myself emotionally (vibrationally), and to feel the way I want to feel to be able to receive the answer[^1], and I'm telling you, there's no limit to how I can feel. no matter the circumstances, I can feel how I want to feel. that's where true gnosis comes from.

[1]: like say I want to explain the way that something works which my human brain does not know -- well, it's only a small process of working myself to feeling like I understand it, and then I do. it really feels like I can know anything I want to know. there's a funny thing, because there's a caveat, where too if I want to be right, then I can also find a way to feel like I'm right. so what then is "truth"? truth to me now is not the absolute validity of things, but the accuracy to the feeling I'm looking for (eg. how well I'm able to interpret what I'm looking for). truth, is in that sense is relative to my present capability of understanding it.


### 2020-10-27 03:36 - not sure what maninfestation I'm looking for

after listening to @[abe-now](2020-10-17 p2) last night, I was thinking about that one question where they said something to the effect of nothing is changing -- right, the expectation of it. expectation is like a stronger belief, and I was thinking a lot about the different things that I would really enjoy being able to do, as well. to further fuel this, robert showed a video tonight on people channeling their bio-magnetism or chi energy @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxeChitTCTI), and it really made me want to be able to show off my powers and stuff. I'm pretty certain that I can do all of that stuff, it's just that I'm not allowed to let that energy collect enough to be able to let it out in a tangible way.

I mean, all of those powers are simply the stuff which pyramids are made of. if you can levitate things, you can move blocks of stone or fly. if you can focus energy into a newspaper, give it a little more amplification, and a good conductor as an output (more than just the acupuncture needle), and you could cut stone. it would be pretty awesome for me to show off that it's possible to make monoliths with the focus of the mind, or shoot fireballs or electricity from my hands -- all things, that I'm certain that I could do, if I were given the opportunity.

---

so I was thinking about that idea in relation to my expectation, and the thing is -- clearly robert is showing that those people *are* focusing their energy, and nosebook either isn't blocking it, or they're more powerful than nosebook. it's true that my expectation is that they would simply go to extreme lengths to ensure that I am not able to do that.

additionally, there's another aspect to this. the whole girls thing just doesn't feel good to me at the moment. it doesn't feel like next logical step or state. the way that I want to feel doesn't even come close to how I'm feeling right now, or how that manifestation seems to be shaping up. I think there's meddling involved.

the reason why I say that, is because when I woke up this afternoon, I had a weird series of things pass through my mind in the typical nosebook forced way, and they didn't really feel all that good to me. I don't really remember very well how it went now, and this is telling to me because if it were something that felt really good to me, then I would remember it in high detail. anyway, it was something like this situation where for whatever reason chris was over with his daughter, and she hung out with me or something... anyway, it was implied that is how we would begin this whole thing.

I gave it quite some thought, and there are a lot of really great things about her which I really like, I could see how ... hold on, let me back up. ok, so yesterday (sunday), I was thinking about the whole thing of who would be "first" -- because I think ... hang on, let me back up further. on saturday, I think (the day before it snowed), I was out there on the field and I was thinking about the idea of the different avatars, and I was pondering the possibility that mr. motor is actually one of my avatars, and the reason why I say that is because it's all attraction, so in a lot of ways, I have to be doing all of this to myself (something that abraham has also said). so when abraham says, you're only doing it to yourself, they mean what they were talking about last night where if you're fearful of someone stealing from you, then you're on the same frequency as the thief.

well, as usual, I like to take that a step more to the extreme. I like to imagine that if you were to take some portion of me, and you were to severely inhibit it in some way (purposefully), then you would get mr. motor, and the beauty of having mr. motor as a sort of avatar of myself means that I have an even wider range. the brilliance is that mr. motor can exist and do what he's doing (apparently, to me) but in the end, I set it up. I am responsible for it, and he's just fulfilling the "role" (like an actor) in making some situation more believable and feel more real.

now, whether he is or isn't an avatar of "me", doesn't really matter, because this gets me to think more about the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity), where they display hermaphodite qualities, both male and female, both good and evil, the best and the worst -- etc. think about what I want to realise: source energy in physical format fully conscious. the thing is that source is all things -- or like the monotheiestic god transitioned to by the isrealites after the YHVH thing didn't keep them from from going into captivity. now, this monothiestic god has both good and evil properties, and is the creator of all types of things.

ok, well, the idea that I constantly am trying to convey to people is that I do not consider things inherently good or bad. I jump around on the emotional scale, because I can. I don't take life seriously enough to get caught up on any single emotion for long enough for it to really cause too much of a manifestation. I enjoy the control that I have over being able go all around, continually either sabotaging the manifestation or not allowing it enough time to truly manifest.

I really am a person that truly believes in not needing the manifestation. actually, as I'm going along, I'm realising more and more that the journey is so much more fun than anything else. another thing that abraham said which I didn't really understand is that they said that no one causes trouble cause they're feeling good. I beg to differ. I have always been very mischievous, and there's this really funny charactor that I find hilarious, which is zeus. that guy is also quite mischievous and when he gets bored, he goes looking for trouble. I'm sort of the same way myself.

however, for example, you could say that lately I've been stirring up trouble on occasion, but it's not because I'm bored (well, maybe a little), but but it's actually because I feel good, and I value the progress or transformation that comes as a result of my mischief. more than that, it's kind of a sort of game for me now, because I can jump in there and, like an actor, temporarily experience some negative emotion, and then go to wherever I want to go after that. I know that it's not a show and I genuinely feel that emotion.

for example, when I was trying to get the backup of my old computer done, I was aware that the way that I feel the negative emotion is just building a stronger vortex toward wanted, so I jumped right in with the negative emotion and let it build up for a bit letting mr. motor restart my computer a whole bunch of times, but the whole time I was aware of what I was doing, and it took me virtually zero time to get back to feeling just fine, and really caring about my computer or anything. I suppose that's some sort of lethargy or apathy, but I really don't care any more. I mean I used to care about programming and wanted to make the world an easier place (I love useability and optimising the daily routine of myself and others with technology), but I've sort of stopped caring.

this isn't the first time that's happened though. I used to really want to make programs that work inside of the eye, but that is clearly not something that I will be doing. then, one day mom was watching something on netflix with this girl running around in a futuristic environment, and everyone had a tablet and was banging around on the screen doing stuff, and I kind of mocked the idea, because there's no way this is the future. the future is the utilisation of the mind to affect things -- whether it's lighting newspapers on fire, or transmitting "static" electricity into people or things -- it doesn't really matter to me. I personally want to construct things in 3d space and interact with them with my mind like tesla did. at any rate, it's obvious to me that the future is influenced mentally, and is not a bunch of touchscreens -- but I can't really control that, and nosebook seems to want to have the monopoly on the whole affecting things with the mind stuff.

anyway, I finally made peace with the reality that I would not be working with any technology that is influencable by the mind, and so I decided, ok let's make the touchscreen reality then and work our way toward that other one. I've tried so much to try and get closed to that reality, because I can see that it will involve some modifications to how we cocnceptualise things. the whole windows mindset needs to be changed completely. if you watch the people on those shows working their imaginary touchscreen programs, they do continuous touches, in almost a rhythmic pattern, as if their program was a sequence of selections or decisions that they're indicating with their finger, not the windows "control panel", menus, selections, and actions -- way of conceptualising, which is very disruptive and doesn't focus the user. anyway. I'm getting off-topic here.

my point is, I just don't care anymore. if I don't ever recover my old code, and people have to continue on using windows and android, I've completely stopped caring. I wanted to get my nosedocs folder updated and uploaded with these new documents and start working on that too, but I'm so tired to trying to fight my way toward it, I don't care anymore. I figure when the world is actually wanting something, then the desire for it will be high enough, that the production of it will be effortless.

---

actually, I guess after typing that out, I do have some "bad feeling" behind some of my troublemaking, but I do enjoy gaining more and more of that actor-like skill of being able to purposefully move up and down the emotional scale completely at my own will. I may not be able to shape-shift like zeus could, but I can emotionally shift in a similar capacity :)

back to the story: I purposefully moved down the emotional scale on my backup, for the purpose of generating more contrast and desire. I can tell that it worked because when I was "star-watching" in my room, I could really feel the extra energy last night in comparison to tonight. tonight there was less energy, but that was because I didn't dip down into the lower emotions today regarding my backup (which is the latest source of energy that I've found I can milk for vision upgrades). I'm actually really beginning to see the value in deliberately moving up *and down* the emotional scale. it's sorta like the skill of taking drugs: if you know how to do it properly, they can be super beneficial -- and I think moving down the emotional scale is my new "fix" for getting more energy going, lol.

---

anyway, let me get back on topic here. I was thinking about all of my different expectations, right now, it's really annoying that my vision is a screen, and that I see that, instead of through my own eyes. I suppose that my expectation is to continually not have that manifestation. right now this is just an idea, but after I convince myself of it, it's a belief, and once I'm good enough at "proving to myself" that it's true, then it's an expectation -- so why don't I simply find a way to expect that I actually see through my own eyes. I also really like the idea of being able to shoot fire and electricity out of my hands, levitation and stuff like that, too. I don't know why I couldn't begin practising an expectation of that.

also, there's this really strong feeling inside of me where I *REALLY* DON'T want to use the girls as a condition for trying to accomplish these things. this sounds backwards, but today I was really thinking a lot about how much the girls could end up trying to rely on me for their good feeling, and I don't want that. I don't want that for me, and I don't want that for them either. of course, I can't control what they do, so if they want to try and rely on me for their good feeling instead of discovering their own ability to find it for theirselves, that's their decision. however, I do have control over what I'm doing, and I think I'm going to continue on without the manifestation for the forseeable future.

the thing that I'm learning is that I want to be like source in physical form, and hopefully I don't have a misconception here, but it looks to me like source isn't at all concerned about the manifestation, because those are all "old news" -- and is instead more enjoying of the journey.

I know that I don't really understand this, but it seems to me like the goal is to find a way to live which is so exhilerating (satisfying), without ever really getting much of a manifestation. the thing that I'm thinking of is, perhaps this idea that instead of me getting a manifestation, what I do instead is find some way to be really mischievous, and really avoid the manifestation for as long as possible -- meanwhile, "forcing" the girls to find their own ability to feel the way they want to feel and leading by my own example[^1].

it has a funny feel to this one, because it sounds similar to the prometheus (the trickster god) story, where instead of giving the humans fire, this time his trickery is a kind of rebellion to giving them the fire -- instead, giving them the opportunity to not need the fire, or find it for theirselves.

[1]: this is a reference to the teenage girl that wanted to go on meds to find a way to feel better.. and abraham's advice to the parent was to set her free, and lead by example, and not need from her certain behaviour to feel good.

### 2020-10-27 11:11 - zeus the troublemaker

(keep in mind, that unlike a traditional movie script, where the actor is confined to a behaving like a single, in real-life, once the person understands and is capable of utilising the different characteristics of the charactor effectively, the person can switch out between them, mixing and matching. one does not not need to feel confined to any single implementation or system of thought, even when you percveive yourself as a coposite personality. you have full power to explore and derive new aspects to your own liking)

ok, so going back to fill in the gaps between the different thoughts in the previous entry, I was explaining the whole perceiving mr. motor as an avatar of myself (or let's say the outside of time version of me. I too am an avatar of him), because that affords me to perceive myself as *extremes* (and you all know how much I love the extremes) of the spectrum. if I am the "first" (we'll touch more on that at the end), then I should also be the last. the alpha and the omega. the beginning and the "end" -- the first and the last.

the reason why I like the first and the last symbolism is because you cannot really understand the phrase "the first shall be the last and the last shall be the first" until you understand LOA. I've been contemplating this phrase for a long time, and judging by the reactions, most people must have thought I was thinking about the girls. that is what happened a few days ago anyway, and what caused this whole episode, because nosebook now had to figure out a way to steer the who would be the first girl, instead of just letting LOA take care of it. I enjoy their steering, because they add so much extra energy into the situation and allow me do these sorts of things.

ok, so when one contemplates the first is the last idea, one immediately notices that the first one to do anything -- well, it's always the first prototype. think iPhone 1. nowadays, no one would use an iPhone 1; it's total garbage in comparison to the later models. therefore the first is always the weakest or "last" manifestation. it's also the one that had to break through the barrier to the new thing, so has the least momentum. another example is myspace. in order for a first to maintain its leading position, usually, it must resort to trying to be a monopoly[^2]. however, I believe that it's important for the first to recognise their new place as becoming the last.

now when thinking of the last becoming the first, this isn't immediately obvious, cept for the obvious acknowledgement that the laest model is (usually) almost always the most improved upon, but it isn't always the most improved upon, and this is why it's not easy to see from a technological standpoint. however, if you look at it from a LOA perspective, and take the example of mr. motor and me. mr motor has a college degree in feeling terrible. however, it won't be that way forever. at some point, he will eventally find himself with no other option than to actually go in the direction of what's wanted -- even if it's literally the last option, and the only way for him to survive. when that happens, the accumulated vortex will be so great, that he will be "forced" to receive such an unimaginable manifestation, that I would argue that this is precisely how evolution happens, and the last becomes the first.

I really like the idea that from a broader perspective I can be the last and the first. it's easy to see if you watch me. when I see something I don't like, I automatically jump right in and push real hard against it, until enough energy is generated (maybe I do this a couple or many times, actually), but then I finally get out of there and allow the improvment I'm looking for. abraham calls this step 5, and I've been doing it all of my life, because my desire is so strong, and I can often see that something is not what I want, very strongly. well, what if you took that aspect of me, but then you simply made a trigger which emotionally prevented me from ever letting go of the fight (like an intense focus on what doesn't feel good where I need to try and force it through willpower or strength into being) -- well, then you would get mr. motor. the only major difference between me and mr. motor is the ability to give up on the fight and allow something I didn't will (or control) to happen. this is, coincidentally, why I understand TLA so well, too :P

you can see that these chraractors are so similar to me, that I don't mind convincing myself that they are just portions of myself. you ever wonder what those crazy druggies are talking about when they say that we are all the same source experiencing different aspects of ourself (or vibrationally similar aspects of yourself) in everyday experience? well, it's just that. you don't need to understand much of LOA, to understand that you couldn't fear the thief if you too were not also having thieving ideas. my motto is to rip people off shamelessly :)

---

ok, so was a pretty good intro to what I'm going to talk about next: going back to yesterday: luke kept popping into my head, and I couldn't figure out why. I simply didn't have enough information to understand it. then, later when abraham was talking about some parents taking issue with their idea that kids should do what they want to do, and not what they should do, I figurded out that reaction when I was reminded of a time that luke was telling me that chloe had to go to sleep at a very early hour, and that bothered me, because mom, when I was a kid let me go to bed as late as I wanted to, as long as I could get up on time. I am certain that I would not be imposing curfews or things like that, allowing each of the girls to begin to find the rhythm that feels best for them.

I was thinking about this later and I noticed that bedtime thing that luke said felt very similar to the different reactions that I was feeling yesterday involving chris and his daughter. it seems that chris too believes I'm way too loose, and perceives that it would be a bad thing if I were to allow his daughter to begin to try and find for herself what feels good, instead of just following her training.

don't worry. I'm not goint to undo any of their training. that's not my job, and it's not what I want to do. all of the girls (cause this I'm sure touches more than just them, because I felt similar things from others too), can find their own way toward feeling the way they want to feel and to doing what they want to do.

here's why: it became very evident to me that the whole reason why nosebook is trying to steer this whole thing, is they want to ensure a codependent relationship for us. they want to ensure that I depend on the girls for feeling good, and that they are my perceived path toward my "connection". why? because right now, I can feel any way I want to feel, and since reality is a reflection of emotion, which is not something they can control, I feel very out of control to them in this situation. they need me to depend on something they control, so that they can control me. it's the classic BS that you encounter in a relationship. one usually wants (or needs) something the other has (usually sex), and so then that becomes a point of control, and whatever that is can be rewarded occasionally in response to desired behaviour.

I do not want this! like I said yesterday, I can't do anything about what the girls are doing, but I refuse to need someone or something else to feel the way I want to feel. that path of codependence leads to destruction, and is essentially the foundation of a monopoly. in a monopoly, everyone must depend on the single source of whatever it is, and have no ability to create it for oneself or get it from another source. this is, the behaviour attributed to the INFECTED ONES[^3] and incidentally this monopoly mentality is my hypothesis upon which I found the structure of the attraction of these cataclysms. it's not hard to see, once someone has experienced a relationship like this to realise that is the precursor to total destrtuction.

don't get me wrong. I like destroying (obsoleting) the old forms, making space for the new creation, but this is similar to a nuclear war. it's not necessary to generate enough desire to make the next human species. I'm pretty confident that it's possible if one recognises that energetically the last is the first and the first is the last. I'm perfectly fine with the idea that as soon as the new species emerges, my job is to push real hard against all the stuff I don't like until I'm ready to allow the new version. this process can happen often -- every few years even, and doesn't need to involve massive destruction to take place. more on this later.

so, for me, I want (even though I cannot force) the girls to be so good at finding what they want and what feels good, that they're discovering their own unique rhythm and path forward. there's no right or wrong way, only things that feel better than others. I really would like them to be capable of also being uncontrollable to nosebook, capable of feeling the way they want to feel, independent of the circumstance.

there are some that are taking issue with this idea. a long time ago, I was having an argument with raquel and I was very frustrated with her. at that time, one of her frieds called her and she did this instant switch from angry to happy to hear from her friend on the phone. I can't, to this day, do that. it takes me a bit of time to change because my emotion has so momentum to it. when I feel something, I really feel something. one of the theories I had is that she didn't really feel as angry with me as she was showing, and was putting on an act to affect a behaviour change in me, or to try and train me (with her negative responses) away from certain ideas. the other idea I had is that all humans are bipolar, however, men have a programmed state (y-chromosome) and a meta state (x-chromosome), meaning that women have two meta states, so it's easier for them to switch between the two[^4]. in this situation, I believe a bit of both was happening. at any rate, I was really angry with her after that because if she can just switch like that, why couldn't she just switch to being nice raquel so that I could feel good and we could give up the fight. obviously the keen out there will notice that me wanting her to change her behaviour so that I could feel good means that's the frequency we were on, and likely she was trying to program my behaviour with her negative or positive emotion (like many mothers do).

she's not my source though, and I shouldn't be trying to modify my behaviour to receive a good feeling from her. knowing what I know now, I'm capable of feeling the way I want to feel, and that is what I want. I'm programmed by my own meta state, not hers[^5].

---

now, I propose we play a game[^1]. abraham says everything is unlimited. I'm certain it is. let's test it.

why? remember the difference I said yesterday between a belief and an expectation? expectations are founded on proof. when someone has found a way to prove to theirself that something is true, it becomes a strong expectation. last night when I was listening to the woman with her unbelievable (to me) expectations of her inept 10 years trying to start a business, I realised that strong female thinkers have a really good capability of holding men to their expectations. this gives nosebook the unique opportunity to try and hone their capability of holding men stagnant with women's expectations of them. so let's try this...

why not train ourselves to expect the "impossible". it's easy to do. I've laid all of the foundations in the previous two sections, so here's the main thing now. I'm trying out my new zeus. zeus was able to shapeshift because he was able to overpower other people's visual perception of him with his own imagination of himself. he literally appeared to other people how he perceived himself in his imagination. this is how shapeshifters work, and why so many of those slippery snakes are such attractive salesmen. it's aryan 7th ray trickery.

I'm beginning to explore the same concept, but instead of perception modifying appearance, I'm doing perception modifying (uhh, there's no good word for it. I'll have to think of something here). it's 5th ray trickery. to explain let me tell a story.

---

once upon a time there was this guy (I'm talking about me), who figured out how to perceive like the dragons (serpents) perceive, and they had to ensure that they maintain their monopoly of that form of perception, resorting to various methods to maintain that monopoly. they want to be the only source by from which people can obtain that perception. they sell this form of perception to a lot of people, and profit off of it. however this guy does not seem to find it a problem because he knows that they have made him literally the last person to actually see things like he sees them. ideally, and for as long as they can hold their monopoly on his discovery, they will ensure that he "never" receives the ability to feel good from his own form of perception. it's not really never. it just means he's the last one to get it, or rather the first one to receive the next new form of it. no big deal there, so he's not concerned that everyone else has access to his own discovery. he'll be the "first" for the next one because of all the size of the vortex the monopoly is creating for him.

the reason why the vortex is so big is because there are many people using that "technology" to feel good, so it's generating a lot of good feeling that he himself is not (yet experiencing). all of that good feeling is combining into a manifestation that feels like the combination of all of that good feeling (and much more because of all of the momentum), and so much like the latest version of anything stands on the shoulders of all of its predecessors, when he finally receives manifestation of his own creation, it will stand on the shoulders of all of the desire created by the good feeling of all the previous.

you can perceive this effect in the most basic sense when one contemplates competition. the perceived limitation of market size or gold medals or whatever, it causes people to put forward their best effort, however, it is that effort that slows them down. the very fact that there are so many working toward the same goal (like say making microprocessors, compilers, or video cards or something), it pushes the whole group's results forward. nevermind the sales figure as the reward, the whole human race is now has higher performance devices than it was previously had.

ok, let's come back to the limited resources and combine the ideas. in the story I told, I was not able to use my own visual capability to feel good. instead there are a whole lot of other people usuing my visual capacity to feel good. this can now be reperceived as the most limited resource -- so limited in fact that it appears that I "never" will use it myself. or, you could say there is such fierce competition that the resource is completely unavailable to me until I finally allow in the next version of it. this limited-resourceness creates lots of desire, or a really big vortex for me. however, what if there were more people like me? what if there were 1000 people like me prevented from receiving their own creation, and were forced because of a monopoly, to allow in the next version. this would create tremendous diversity in "new versions" that are allowed in. diversity is good because diversity is non-destructive contrast.

what I'm saying is that the more competition there is, or the more people trying to get the same resource, the more limited that resource is. in a sense that is kind of what is happening now, and what I'm saying is that is creating a bigger vortex for each person in that competition, and if they finally give up on the idea (like me) that it needs to be that exact manifestation, that opens me up for something completely new. for example, what if I don't even need to see with my eyes! why can't I create a whole new form of perception which doesn't need eyes. what if it was based on something (like emotions), which has nothing to do with appearance and had to do more with its vibe.

for example, if there's one person making microprocessors, that person is a monopoly, so there's no real desire created to outperform anything unless the person has strong self-accomplishment or a desire to continually improve their product. usually not the case. however, if there are two people in the race, then it's kinda almost a friendly competition. however, what if there were 100 people making microprocessors, then desire to make better, faster, and more specialised versions would emerge as a new thing. what about 10000? even more desire still.

the naysayers would say that's just not possible because if there are 10000 producers, the competition would saturate the market and it'd be impossible for the consumers to find their product. I agree in physical, but I'm talking about vibrational, or frequencial. you can have millions of frequencies in the same space. in fact, the world we live in is composed of many many more than millions of frequencies coexisting at once. LOA is responsible for getting the right microprocessors to the right desireers of them.

the naysayers may also bring up the idea of economics, where sales gives more economic resources to create new research and development, and again I agree in a physical world, but in a vibrational world, there are no limit to how many different feelings you can feel to give birth to these alternate models.


[1]: this is where I begin my character transition from moses to elijah.

[2]: I believe that one can feel the monopoly vibe in the original atlantis thing, where they began to notice that they were now beginning to have rival competition (zeus and the athenians), and so to maintain the leading position, they resorted to monopoly tendencies, and when attempting to subdue thier competition, suffered total defeat.

[3]: which is why I mostly believe that narrative, because along with the combined extreme amounts of efforting involved by the creators, and the total paja mental they did on the previous 7 planes, there has to be at least a large amount of truth to that narrative, because that resonates very very well with the present circumstances we're experiencing today.

[4]: I've been paying a lot of attention to esther feeling her out, because she seems to be very single minded in her normal state, similar to a man, almost as if her default state is no longer a meta state anymore, because it's so much more different than her abraham state.

[5]: men usually have very little difference between their programmed and meta state[^4], with their meta state usually being more childlike or feminine and so these states are hidden from the general public, but that meta state can be anything you want it to be (actors know what I'm talking about here). it can channel any frequency or a composition of frequencies. another thing that men don't realise is that their meta state affects (programs) their default state. the genetics that I have, which nosebook values is my own creation, and comes as a result of my own "programming". for women, it seems to me like both meta states program each other[^6], and it seems like by default these meta states seem to come from the mother, so a woman will often find one of their bipolar states similar to their mother's default or father's meta state and the other will begin to grow in rebellion to that, trying to find the opposite, providing internal "contrast" or, to the appearance to most a "bipolar" woman (usually this rebellion doesn't begin to show up until teenage years, I've noticed)

[6]: which is likely why they're considered water, cause they're always changing to a different thing when they switch back and fourth, whereas a man seems more constant with one of the polarities rarely[^7] changing. you can see this often in really dinosaur-like families (usually they have a lot of money). you see the son, andy you say, "wow, he's just like his father!" -- because he is, and the only hope he has really of making any improvment is to find the "holy grail" (x-chromosome from a woman) capable of improving his archaic y-chromosome.

[7]: I have accomplished the ability to change this more static state very rapidly, and in my opinion, it is my most cherished capability. this ease of change is what makes me much more womanlike, while still mainaining many masculine features, and I think this flexibility is the basis upon which the hermaphodite is made.

### 2020-10-29 17:18 - another thought experiment: 5th ray illusion

this concept is hard to explain and I didn't do a very good job at it. there's a deeper meaning here which is elusive. it used to be a continuation of the previous entry, but I think it needs more work. t

as a thought experiment, let me use an abstract (perhaps dream-state) person to describe this concept. imagine that there was this amazing guy that began to appeared to 10k[^8] people in their dream state at night. all of those 10k people really liked this guy and perceived (individually) that he was a sort of premonition to a future reality where he would show up for reals in their life. each of these 10k are all creating (vibrationally with their desire) a guy in their dream state that they really like.

they dream about him all the time and nosebook becomes aware of this, becasuse he's really popular to dream about and he has magical capabilities, so nosebook wants to cash in on this guy. nosebook prevents his appearance in dream to those original 10k, and is instead rented/sold to some 1M individuals. those 10k people who were dreaming about the guy initially feels like this dream guy totally disappears, for them in their dreams, but they can still feel him all the time, so they continue to believe that eventually he will show up. they're not able to have their relationship manifestation of this guy for quite some time. all the while, all those 1M are enjoying him in their dreams quite nicely.

so, for some long period of time there are a whole lot of other people enjoying this guy, and he remains off-limits to the original 10k. as time continues on, just like people enjoying my visual capability before I'm capable of receiving it, the 1M renting and enjoying this guy are creating a big vortex for the 10k later.

at some point, he somehow transforms into something new, and he's no longer perceivable by the 1M renters anymoro. when that happens, the desire that was created in each of those 10k oringial individuals will manifest into some sort of dream-state dude or maybe even reality. what I'm saying is that when he makes the transition from his old form to the new form, he will make that transformation for each of those 10k originals uniquely, and will show up as the product of their unique desire and contain the unique aspects desired by each of them, in addition to all of the aspects appreciated by those 1M renting him out. in fact, the more people that uniquely desire him, the more diversity of him there will be... eg. if there were 10x more, he would contain all of the aspects desired and appreciated by those 100k and 1M people at the same time, however, with each of those 100k activating (attracting) their unique attributes of him.

so, in a sense, the more competition, or the more scarce the resource is, the bigger the manifestation it is, and it's only the perceived limitation that obfuscates the improvement. for example, in a race, only one person can finish "first", so there's only one "winner" -- however, the desire from the contestants provides makes it possible for those cars, legs, boats, microprocessors (whatever) to go faster. so while the limited resource is that there's only one "winner", the whole group benefits from the competition. vibrationally, this is even more.

I'll explain more in the future, but what I'm trying to get at here is that I'm certain that there are no limits, so why not take advantage of it? if we can make more than one "last" (which then becomes the first), we have gone from serial to very diverse parallel. I'm leaving this explanation purposefully in a difficult spot here. the part missing is the alteration of perception because I'm not talking about physical things, but energetic (feeling) things.


### 2020-10-29 17:42 - thinking about doing something instead of just doing it

the last few months or so I have been experiencing extreme lethargy in a lot of different places of my life. it started out with my programming, and then began to invade a lot of different portions of my life. up until now, often times what I did was, especially if it was something I didn't want to do, is to think out the task until I feel like I want to do it, because usually the process of thinking it out elevated my desire to do it.

however, I first noticed that with star-watching if I thought about doing it, the less I actually felt like doing it -- which was opposite of how it used to be. as a result, I know now that every time I get out there and start walking I feel good, and I really enjoy the trip out to go star-watch, so I just do it. I don't think as much about it anymore. I just do it.

same thing with my sleep. I noticed that if I wake up and the thing I do is I think about getting up, then there's much less likelihood that I'll actually get up. I have to just get up.

---

so my problem here is how do I reconcile this with how I am? I don't do stuff that I can't feel, because I know that if I do something that I'm not feeling, it either fails or it doesn't go well in some way. I've found that I have to find a way to feel like I want to do it, if I'm going to do it.

so, take for example my room. usually, I don't want to clean it, so I don't. I want to clean it though (just like I want to program), but I never end up doing it, because as soon as I think about cleaning, at first it feels like I want to clean more, but then soon thereafter, I no longer feel like cleaning, almost as if the desire has vanished.

I have noticed this on a number of other topics as well. it happens a lot when I want to write something (notice how often the subjects on the bottom there stack up, and only very rarely do I actually getting to write these ideas down), or for example I want to respond to tina, or I want to write a program to begin presenting these different concepts I'm accumulating in a nicer format than these text files. or, get my programming files off of the mac, or whatever. these ideas seem to evaporate, it seems.

I believe the solution to this problem is what people call "living in the now" -- which is constantly making action and thought based on how I feel, and essentially thinking less and less. my source knows all of the stuff that's important to me and knows the best way for me to get there, so all I have to do is to continue to find ways to feel good, and all of that stuff will work itself out.

I know this is the right way, because it essentially makes my life automatic, almost as if I'm observing myself (5d perception), yet even if nosebook is capable of keeping me from that form of perception, once I master how I feel and the ("living in the present") actualisation of that, they won't be able to keep that from me -- whether I visually perceive things differently or not.

I'm just going to be acting more upon the feeling in the momnent that I get it, instead of thinking about it. it's all about living in the present, and navigating between emotions that feel good but don't have much desire in them (eg. bordom, accepting, ok, content, satisfied, ...), and letting your source take care of the different actions necessary to realise your desires. we'll have to see what happens here.

---

there's good reason for this. you will notice that when you look at the emotional scale, there are a whole lot more words to describe the negative end of the scale than the positive end. I can think of tons more words to add in on the bottom end, and to our brains, they do have validity. however, on the higher end, all of these emotions come with an unexplainable portion to them. the lower ones do too, but to a less extent. for example, I could feel anger, and that anger is really the culmination of all of the times that someone has (for example) interrupted me or something, and though I feel anger, the underlying thing behind it is the desire to be able to express myself. all emotions have an underlying desire and logic to them, even if it's not immediately apparent what it is.

so, when you feel good, let's say content or hopeful, again there's a "reason" (or logic) to why you feel that way, but also there is a desire as well. when you feel content or satisfied, notice that the underlying desire is virtually undetectable. I believe that this is kind of the way to go and what abraham describes as a soft (gentle) desire, because when when you're not mixing your desire into the emotion, there's less "negative" or unwanted aspect to it. if you really want something and you feel very hopeful about it, if it dosn't come the way you want it to come, then you feel an equal amount of disappointment.

therefore, the less amount of desire mixed in with the emotion is present, the easier it is for you to be guided by your source to move around between the things that do matter to you (what's really important). the reason is, that your desire is known by your source, and the way toward it is found in the good feeling emotions. if you're moving toward it, then it feels good (think if this like blueshift), and if you're moving away from it, it feels worse right.

well, now it becomes more and more obvious why the best things are always found in the "next logical step/state" -- and they don't really feel like something big or amazing to them, because they no longer contain that "wanted/unwanted" "desire/dispair" possibility within the emotion... it's much "softer" and feels more natural. it feels more natural, because you already feel like how you want to feel, so it's a small jump.

you navigate time with your emotions, and desire is the indicator that you want to feel some way. if that emotion is a long distance from where you are, then the desire (to feel a certain way) will be strong. however, if you are very nearby to feeling that way, the desire will not feel very strong, because you already feel quite a bit like that reality. the less of a big jump, the better.

obviously now, you must begin to wonder about the navigation of time and sex, because if what I'm saying is true, then sex basically always means a big jump in time. you cannot have sex, and feel like you normally do (at least it's not physically possible for a man anyway). this concept opens up a lot of more questions, which is why I ended on it :)


### 2020-11-01 04:23 - eye of ra and hathor

I was watching the video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_FvDOzf0J4) where robert (different one than the usual robert) was talking about the connection with da-vinci and the great pyramid of ros-tau (taurus mountain). matt has already done a great job of connecting the giza platau to the taurus constellation which you can watch here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9y_-q5jT8), however in that video robert shows the eye of ra above jesus in the painting cause I never paid much attention to this eye of ra before.

turns out, the eye of ra (right eye) is personified by a goddess. sometimes it's a lion (sekhmet/bastet), and sometimes it's a cow (hathor). then, there's a myth which has horus fight seth for the throne of osiris. set removes horus' left eye (eye of horus / thoth).

set is an interesting figure because he's usually associated with the planet mercury, and is associated with serpent symbology. I like to think that set is like the "destructive" version of mercury (7th ray), and thoth is the creative side of mercury. this is probably why set destroys horus' left eye (this is thoth's eye). there are variations to the story, but the one I like the most is when thoth goes to restore the eye, it has been replaced, so he turns the eye into a serpent which is placed on the brow where "it could rule the whole world" making it the effective ruler of the world (eg. the all-seeing eye symbolism on the *one* dollar bill).

interestingly enough the set guy is perceived by the greeks as synonymous with typhon. typhon, I believe has [many more similarities to vulcan](!typhon-vulcan-similarity) than to thoth, actually, but the symbolism is clear that this is the "destructive aspect" of either mercury or vulcan[^1].

in the same way that different aspects are represented as the deity, sekhmet (then lion) is the "destructive" side of venus (1st ray), and hathor (the cow) is the creative side of venus.

ok, so that was the setup, because here's where it gets juicy...

in da-vinci's last supper, robert shows that there is an *eye of ra* above jesus, which I find interesting because I would have assumed that the eye of ra, which is associated with the goddess sekhmet/hathor would go over mary, and not over jesus. I would have guessed the eye of horus to go over jesus, because afterall, horus is the [reborn deity](!reborn-deity).

---

I don't really know how to express this next part very well, but I understand the symbolism there. I'll explain: I had a brain haemorrhage where my left-eye (thoth's eye) was disabled, and when it happened, I had a definite experience where I met jesus and he entered into my *heart*. this isn't an uncommon thing for people to experience relating to interactions with jesus. however, for me I had a paralysed side, and the key to "unlocking" the paralysis of my left-side, was to begin to learn to "accept" and integrate my emotions into my every-day experience. along the process (involving various psychedelics), I came to begin to perceive my right-brain (left-side) as a demanding little girl with insatiable desire. in berlin when I was going through various extraordinary experiences, learning, I associated this dorment partially paralysed side with the 1st ray (desire) female (emissive), eg. hathor/venus.

essentially, what I'm saying is that through various psychedelic experiences, I began to identify my left-side, which I personified originally as jesus, to later be this sekhmet/hathor 1st ray female that was sort of stuck inside of me. I always identified my right-side as vulcan, the husband of venus in mythology. in the sirian guide, vulcan is paired with saturn and venus in the triad, which is another weird thing too

anyway, that was a lot of symbols to explain that I don't find it weird that this picture da-vinci is identifies jesus as having the eye of ra (personfifed by hathor/venus), and not mary. it perfectly fits my experience with jesus, and then resulting paralysis of my left side (or eye of thoth).

if that myth has any value to it, then when thoth returns to restore my left eye, he will notice that another eye (developed by me) has regrown in its place, and so therefore the previously extracted left eye of thoth will transform into a serpent, being placed on the forehead "where it could rule the whole world."

let's just plug in the symbols here: set, the serpent symbology associated with the planet mercury (eg. the serpent nosebookers guys that are trying to run the show with their hermetic super powers), gets in a fight with horus over the throne of osiris (saturn), and set destroys horus' left thoth eye, forcing him to grow his own replacement. after growing his replacement the stollen left-eye from horus is turned into a serpent and used by nosebook so "it could rule the whole world."[^2]

---

there's another strange thing associated with the opposites found in these symbols, because in the zodiac, opposite the taurus (hathor) is the serpent and the eagle -- however, opposite the lion (sekhmet) is the symbol of the man (horus). this is probably the original distinction between the eye of ra symbolising the goddess (and is also called the eye of thoth[^3]) and opposite the eye of horus.

inside of the great pyramid (located in the ros-tau (taurus) mountains) is the symbol of the bull (hathor), yet very much out of the ordinary, is the the combination of these other two symbols just outside in the sphinx, eg. horemakhet or horus of the two horizons. which two horizons? well, logic says that the sphinx is most likely referring to when the sun (eye of ra) is rising in the east, man is facing to see it, while the part facing west, the hindquarters, is in the direction opposite, which is the constellation of the lion.

make what you want from it. it's all very weird to me.

[1]: the typhon guy is also banished by zeus to exist in tartarus, which is where the serpents are banished to live.

[2]: another variation of the story is one that is told by the festival of drunkenness illustrated by matt here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gWtr5lKycw) and @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP9-C8w5L1U), which appears to be a retelling of an ancient story where sekhmet destroys many people and ra satiates her with red beer. this was probably a prehistoric event, remembered only as myth. later after ra subdued her, she was known as the loving hathor[^4].

[3]: I find it very strange that the same symbol for the eye of ra (that is the light of the sun), is directly connected with the goddess personified as sekhmet/hathor, yet at the same time is connected with the moon in the symbolism for the eye of thoth. the personification of this eye as sekhmet (1st ray female) and as thoth (7th ray male) is interesting because these are the alpha and omega (the beginning and the end), the most extreme ends of duality coming together (the snake eating its tail); the hermaphodite (hermes/aphrodite fusion).

[4]: interestingly enough, the 18th dynasty saw a resurgance in the cult of the sphinx, which was about the time of the exodus, because the exodus seems to be correlated with the planet venus, which, if velikovski is correct, the events that took place are a kind of retelling of the story related in "the book of the heavenly cow" where sekhmet (as the eye of ra) is unleashed on humankind. at the same time (18th dynasty). at the same time, there was increased worship to anhur which is a *male* lion figure associated with war, so if the exodus is the time of the bronze age collapse, and then the following aryan invasion, or if seen symbolically, the beginning of the age of aries, a male lion figure in another variation of the myth instead goes searching for the eye (sekhmet or mehit). it all gets very complicated with egyptian myths, probably because they used pictures instead of names for the characters...


### 2020-11-02 03:51 - thinking about water and fire

a while back in a particularly scatter-brained entry (@[noseblog](2020-10-27 11:11)), I mentioned my theory of the differences between women and men biologically speaking. I realise that in today's society, one can claim any number of genders that they feel appropriate for their presentation to others, however biologically speaking, you either have an y-chromosome, or you don't. it's really that simple.

I believe that the y-chromosome is a pre-programmed emotional state machine (that men inherit from their father) and the x-chromosome is a meta state machine capable of tuning into whatever it wants to.

first of all, let me begin by expaining that I believe the emotion which a person is experiencing is a vibrating wave which, while sometimes feels more strongly in one location of the body than others (body memory), that's only evidence of more resonance in that area, and that this waveform is consistent throughout the whole body. additionally, I want to say that emotion, or your vibration has for men especially a lot of momentum to it, however women[^1] seem to be able to switch with sometimes almost no residual momentum. other times, they cannot switch so easily.

second, I want to note that in the that entry I also made the correlation between women and men and that this chromosomal difference is actually what makes one more "water" and the other more "fire"...

the fire can be seen easily as a strong peak amplitude waveform -- like you *really* want to do something. so it feels strong and "spikey" to me -- like almost some sort of aggitation. for a man this urge seems to come usually from the y, in the form of sex-drive, and the only thing that's holding them back is the opposite chromosome, which is in most cases the x, which is some sort of programmed meta-emotional state machine (MESM). obviously, the distinction for a woman is that both sides are x so both are programmed.

now contrast the feeling of water to the feeling of fire as an explanation for the differences between the xx and xy configuration. for water, the tendency is toward stillness, where you perturb a pool of water, it will return back to stillness with time. however, if you perturb a fire, it flares up bigger and burns away the fuel more rapidly. this relationship can be seen very easily with lesbian couples, who tend, if one of the women is not especially firey, toward stagnation or stillness. in contrast, many gay couples ... well you got sparks shooting all over the place, and there's a lot of rapid acceleration and burnout if one is not especially watery.

now, how do I relate this to desire. well, if desire is like a sharp peak in the vibration, almost as if someone has just plucked the string, then the opposite chromosome is designed to either amplify or to reduce the waveform. therefore, you can imagine that "unchecked desire" (that is, the emotional manifestation of desire) goes straight into action. often times, we try to quell these desires by blocking them. this seems to be essentially the action of the x and not the y. for men, the x seems to be built more as a kind reducer of vibration more than an amplifier, and it is through the cultivation of the feminine side, that the man learns to begin to amplify his creative, conceptual, and intuitive (vibrational, not-thought) side.

so imagine that you have a desire that is 5V, and you have a resistance circuit on the opposite chromosome of 3V, then you would experience 2V of desire. because it's vibrational, this waveform, even though it's 2V, will slowly build up to where it's big enough for one to take action on. the stronger you feel something, the more likely you are to take action.

it is for this reason that I do not believe that trying to quell one's desire is ever that effective of a method. it may work for a while as you apply the opposite wave to try and quell the desire, but you cannot destructively interfere with 100% of the waveform, meaning it will continue to grow, whether you like it or not.

most women (and some very repressed men) are taught to quell their desire and so every thing that they feel strongly, they immediately work against their own desire trying to quell it's intensity, meaning that many women have very strong x circuits which generate strong desire, and then on the opposite side have also very strong x circuits, which generate strong "resistance" (that is, the opposite waveform) to that desire. both men and women do this, but it's easier to see with women because they have two easily programmable circuits. in contrast, it appears like most men seem like they're trying to quell their "animal instincts".

the other way that people get around this desire spurting out everywhere is to partition it, and say, ok in these situations (environments), this desire is ok to amplify, and in these environments it's necessary to quell it.

any time that you are quelling your desire, you are working against yourself, and this is "split-energy", meaning it's going 5V in one way and 5V in the opposite direction, so no movement (or desire) is felt. again though, it's absolutely impossible to make that circuit complicated enough to perfectly destrctively interefere with that emotion so as to completely reduce it to 0V[^2] so its attraction power[^3] will continue to rise and it'll keep summoning more "non-physical energy" from your source toward the desire. the only way to truly quell the desire is instead find a way to transform that energy into something desired.

this universe is only addition, and it's the nature of these destructively interfering interactions which gives the illusion of entropy, however, everything is always getting more, and the *only* way to rid oneself of unwanted energy (desire, emotion, etc.), is to transform it into something desired to to redirect (dissipate) it into something compatible (vibrationally similar) with that energy. this means that only you can cause your own death by finding a way to feel opposite of how you want to feel, which is constantly going toward more (in both directions).

---

oops, derailed again; back on topic...

when reproduction happens, the sperm contains both x and y, so what seems to be happening[^4] (and this seems to be confirmed by my observation) is that the x is like the vibrational "guidance system" for the sperm, and the one that is most attracted (vibrsationally similar) to the egg's x frequency, so *ideally* the most vibrationally similar sperm will be the one that gets there first and "wins" (ideally). what seems to happen is that the transferred x MESM of the man is combined in the egg with the woman's present meta-state throughout the pregnancy. if the fetus is female, then it will inherit the MESM of the woman as well. it's unclear to me how the mutation occurs, but it seems that some sort of transformation of at least one of the x occurs and a amalgamate is formed as a result.

biologically, this whole process is not very clear to me, but what I do know is that some sort of upgraded (based on the woman's meta-state) MESM is transferred to the fetus. this MESM seems to be a combination of the man's x and the woman's x. for the female fetus, it seems like the same thing is happening, but don't know of both x's are modified, or just one. either way, the meta-state and the MESM seems to come from both.

the picture that I have is that it's most commonly found that one chromosome is usually the stronger of the physical/mundane desire and resistance, and the other is more often geared toward the "spiritual" or the improvement of the emotional body's desire and resistance. neither contains 100%, but it seems that one is often more stronger than the other. for men, the physical is usually mostly the y, and very little x. for women, the physical seems to be inherited mostly from her mother's x.

the other picture that has formed is that men seem to inherit, in some cases this very archaic MESM[^5], and I think some DNA is actually designed to perpetually keep men cycling around between terrible emotional states, because that's where the y has been programmed to operate. I have noticed that often times men with this "genetic disposition", which do not like to constantly feel bad, or need a break from constantly feeling bad, have to "switch" over to their x side, which in a lot of cases is mode feminine or childlike. this actually explains probably a lot of gay men, actually; they simply do not like feeling that archaic masculine programming, and instead opt for something a bit more flexible.

the other thing is that I'm noticing that women, who have been trained to quell their desire for so long are actually beginning to experience the opposite effect, because one cannot fully quell the desire to remove it. quelling it only reduces it tempoarily, and will return eventually stronger, meaning that women are beginning to have stronger and stronger desire than ever before, which means they're getting more aggressive. this is likely the cause of some gay men too, coming from strong emotional stresses in their environment, usually from someone else's MESM, like an overbearing mother or father.

I believe that both our environment, our own focus, and others around us program and influence our x (MESM), meaning that as a child be begin to resonate with the infuences of the environment, those around, (or the preprogrammed y) by default, but one can consciously influence that frequency into a different place by finding a way to feel something different, using physical conditions (the most influential are drugs, sex, and rock and roll), or the power of your focus (what you're giving your attention to with your thoughts and physical senses) to change how you feel. this is, essentially programming your MESM, or your x (if you want to look at it biologically[^6])

---

ok, so let's get back to some ways to use these ideas, because both the x and the y are programmable, however the y seems much more stagnant.

I have been constantly seeing that the "future" for the female species is to become more fire-like -- that is, more aggressive and emotionally potent. what this means is that there is less resisted energy, meaning that the waveform will have more strong peaks that are uninhibited (unresisted) due to environmental propgramming. I also belive that it's going to be the future for men to become more water-like as well.

what I mean by fire-like is that states are not resisted as much, so you're not working against yourself so much. you're more closer to 100% inside of the state, rather than trying to quell your own emotion because of strange beliefs.

what I mean by water-like is that both chromosomes are flexible enough (meaning easy enough to reprogram) to be able to accomodate more desired states. what the ability to reprogram and switch easily means, is that it's easier to *transform* -- not quell -- the emotion into a more desirable state or better feeling. I don't mean becoming complacent, but using the power of your perception to transform things which don't feel good into new perceptions which feel better.

this has obvious implications for everyone's evolution, but what it means for women, is that as they become more and more "unresisted", they'll quickly gain that fire that they're looking for, and this sounds super woman-power-like, but they won't need anything external to get it. for men, it means that by default the more water-like men will be able to transform their own y-chromosome much more rapidly, allowing for their own rapid improvement and that their sons will automatically come pre-installed with this program. obviously, genetically the men that are capable of feeling better will far outperform the ones that cannot find ways to feel good. this means that the coming evolution of the male species will, by "survival of the fittest" cull the ones that are not water-like.

this is almost certainly the coming transformation from aquatic ape to aqarian man.

---

what I essentially did, was to redefine the fire and water ideas a bit. one can see that with the above perception, the new stagnant man is now the one *without* water capabilities. all of humankind will become more fire-like as one reduces their resistance to their own emotional states. it's going to be a rapid evolution[^7].

[1]: and some effeminate men too, however someone sensitive, like a child can feel the underlying emotion, behind the performed emotion. this is the distinction I make, because it seems that while a man can switch between emotions, the residual is evident, yet with women, after switching, my experience has shown that it seems to be less or almost no residual in some cases.

[2]: actually, not only is it impossible, but additionally, there's another factor as well, which most do not really understand because modern electricity theory does not talk about it, however, if you were able to destructively interfere with a signal perfectly, it hasn't completely destroyed all motion. when destructively interfering, there is always another thing formed perpendicular to the direction of the current, which in the case of a wire, the majority of this energy is lost, leaving the wire radially perpendicular to the wire. this energy isn't completely dissipated, and you could consider this something more closer to "static" electricity.

[3]: I don't know how to explain this concept. it may be magnetism, but when something is destructively interfered with, it creates something which is not immediately attractive, probably becasue it's perpendicular to the direction of the current flow, but it appears to attract more current. I believe that if you could get this going the right way, you would easily create "over unity" -- which is actually the proof of what I've been doing this whole time.

[4]: I don't know how it works, and apparently science [has some misconceptions about it too](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC19448), which I didn't fully understand, so I'll just write what my intuition is telling me (this whole thing is a theory anyway), and then modify this concept as I understand it better. I don't know if it's transmitted biologically or frequencially between mates.

[5]: I use myself for example in this case. when I was very young, I was a totally out of control emotionally, trying to shut things down and I really liked guns and powerful things (not saying that's bad, just guns and someone incapable of controlling their emotions is probably a bad combination). I had, in my own estimation, very awful original DNA, however I believe my own focus has allowed the transformation of this DNA into something much better. I have essentially reprogrammed my physical or y to be a much more well-adapted MESM.

[6]: likely a lot of the "junk" DNA is actually the more transient or "temporary" programming for the MESM, or perhaps additional frequencies designed to influence the state changes and other environmentally-specific threshold tweaks.

[7]: a word of caution to men wanting quell their evolution[^8] by using some external means to feel better than they really do. the contrast between states is important. you don't want to be stoned all the time; I recommend turning it off so that you modify your y with your own perception.

[8]: in ~12ky, when the golden-age begins to wane again, those with the fragile y's requiring good feeling fuel will need to ensure this resource remains available, meaning that they will remain superior in as long as they can continue to maintain their external source of good feeling, but if it goes away, those with that fragile y-chromosome will go the way of the dinosaur, almost like, all of a sudden the gravity on the planet increases, immediately landlocking many flying creatures, now too heavy to maintain flight. don't let the superior conditions lull you into complacency. allow yourself to gain the capability to navigate in less than ideal conditions, too -- or just don't worry about it, letting the evolution do all the work for you[^9].

[9]: this is an interesting thing to think about. dinosaurs, which were mostly reptiles, after some shift in density (gravity), they were forced to either transform into a birds (like an eagle), or to continue on as a reptile, but instead of walking or having a long neck, instead are confined to crawling on the ground (like a lizard or serpent) and "eating the dust of the earth"

### 2020-11-01 13:24 - more ideas on the MESM

in the previous entry (or maybe it was the one before), I was talking about how someone sensitive like a child, is able to detect the underlying emotion in a man. I was speaking somewhat from experience, but I was more referring to my own condition. you will notice that more often than not in the past, when an action happens, let's say someone is doing something unfair to me or whatever, then my left-side will shake, while my right side remains (usually) unaffected. you can perceive this as essentially what I have been pre-prpgrammed to feel (fear or anger), and what my meta-state is on top of it. there is residual. I can't just feel calm when my base programming is telling me to go to fear state

---

explanation of how the state machine works. it's not action based, and emotions (or concepts) are both the destinations and the states. the different frequencies it contains seems to mean that the chromosome itself will fold differently in different frequency ranges. different states are possible within each fold structure (or vibrating structure). again, no state is really ever held for any length of time, so you could consider a group of states, or a loop in states to be the frequency base of that state -- like if you play a chhord on a piano, each of these strings are vibrating independently at some speed, so you could simpulate that chord in a single string structure if you modeled that the string were able to consciously transfer between two states (on and off) in a series which would make the same vibrational pattern that the chord makes. ultimately that sequence of states will loop back to the beginning of the sequence, meaning that the sequence of states there is like a way to model a multi-string chord. obviously, the faster the state changes happen (the higher the frequency the ESM is running at, the more strings in the chord can be simulated).

if you look at the quantity of the strings as essentially as the edges of a regular polyhedra (n-gon), then you draw the lines between them, like you're making the metatron's cube, then you will see that the more edges that outer polyhedra has, the more definition the shape of the emotion has. I realised after getting into robert's head that you have to think of these things visually, kind of like what paveen was showing as the yantras embedded in the structures. these are vibrational states, and probably those structures were designed to operate at that frequency.

the real breakthrough for me was seeing that the more higher frequency gets, it's just a jumble of more lines, so to make sense of it, you have to see the line segments between and *bold* some of them, then shapes begin to emerge. if you turn on the ESM at some portions of the line, and then off at other portions of the line, in sync/harmony with it's base frequency, an image begins to emerge.

when I was talking about the archaic DNA, you could imagine that some draconic DNA is only capable of maintaining operation at a certain frequency range. if you go too low, a whole bunch of stuff starts falling apart, and if you go to high, again things start falling apart, so for example, once we surpass the frequency speed that was present during the time of atlantis, then trying to run this DNA at that faster speed could feel pretty bad. this perfectly explains why a lot of these archaic types want to constantly slow things down. the reason why too, is because no matter how much they try to quell those impulses/states, the LOA and the attractiveness of things (only add) means that no matter how much they try, both their energy trying to go at the faster speed, and also the frequency of the environment is continually becoming more.

in ~12ky when the golden age begins to wane again, when we reach the furthest most point again (when was that, aries?) the earth will not be in nearly as much of a unenergised state as it were before unless some structure (like a pyramid) were to force the planet to be even more out of alignment to the sun (castrated), capable of receiving less and less energy from polar alignment with the the sun, only receiving the most energy during the equinox. obviously, the most out of alignment a planet can be, would be to have it tilted perpendicular to its orbit, not having any polar alignment at all with the sun (like uranus). we'll have to see as we approach the golden age, but it may be planned to construct another pyramid that forces the earth more out of alignment with the sun after its next pole flip[^1].

at any rate, the energy on the planet will continue to become more and more. it came to my attention that these discussions seem to have some strange resonance with my inquiry to robert about zeus having vulcan construct the new female prototype (pandora) from the clay of the earth as a punishment for prometheus giving humans fire (heart ability to navigate time reality[^2] with their emotions[^3]), and so the obvious desirable thing to do will be to find a way of overriding the x-chromosome with technology, or forcing it to be subservient to some other artificial state machine, forcing the DNA to run at the desired (programmed) speed, instead of it being constatntly subject to the fluctuating environmental conditions. I mean, why not really kick the can down the road, right?? why not. I'm all for it. it just means more contrast. I have another idea to create even more contrast also which I will outline soon[^4]. at any rate, it seems like the goal is to continue to let the serpents delay their extinction for as long as possible, continually finding an out for them. I imagine that they'll eventually be forced to live inside of the machines, having their emotional/energy structure become completely artificial (actually that reminds me of star wars: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD2UrB7zepo)).

I'm all about trying to find a way for them to find a way to artificially create the "ideal" energetic conditions for their species. I think it's good that they need to try and figure out how to survive in contiually increasing energetic conditions. the increase will never stop, and it'll only get more and more, so they should(?) try to find a way to survive it and delay their extinction until we have an appropriate (robotic) replacement for them.

speaking of extinction, if you think about the x chromosome as a vibrational structure, which vibrates at a rate specific to a consciousness stream, then you can imagine that the MESM created by the sperm and the egg, create a sort of vibrational vortex which kind of like "sucks in" a "soul" resonant with that MESM when the "soul" taking physical expression begins its consciousness (all of your individual cells are conscious).

so, like the dinosaur's transition into the modern reptile species, with some upgrading to the bird -- as soon as there is no longer a physical structure capable of giving that consciousness stream a suitable resonant form inside of a MESM, then it's forced to transcend its form into a new one. the dinosaur's extinction wasn't a bad thing. it created two entirely new species from its extinction. some species (like the cockroach) have seen zero improvements over millions of years, because their function continues to need expression and no real improments on their design have been needed for them to continue that function.

therefore, if the function of the form is still desirable, then mother nature provides a way for that form to continue its expression without going extinct.

so, what I'm saying is, for as long as it's desirable to have people inhibiting the energetic expression (manifestation), then there will be no extinction. for me their function is highly desirable. last night, I was thinking about how much more "boring" it will be when I no longer have someone trying to hold me back. if no one finds value in it, I certainly will, so in some random universe it'll probably just be me and the reptiles in an infinite loop gaining more and more power until they literally cannot hold on anymore. it would be pretty boring with just me though, and diversity is very desirable, so that won't happen, but for as long as I exist (which sounds like is eternal), their function will alwasy at least be desired by me, so I doubt their full extinction. they must however continue to upgrade into ever more powerful/superior forms to keep up, though (which is what they want).

[1]: I can see why this may be desirable, and I actually think that this is already planned, and it may even be the case that this same technique utilised to not only keep the planet from having its poles flip, but also to continually receive less and less energy from the sun. this will force the planet to be the creator of its own reality (environment), and not to rely on the sun. it also has the advantage of allowing the archaic DNA to continue to exist on this planet for quite a few more 24ky sirius cycles.

[2]: in a future entry I want to explore this further begause as robert was talking (especially when he mentioned that he drew the I-ching symbol), I could see how saturn, having a hexagon at its north pole (south too?) constructs time from these fractal waves in a similar manner. this time sequence is essentially like the fractal ESM for the solar system, and it may have something to do with its conjuction with jupiter to set this (last time they were conjuct was 2000-05-28 and next time the saturn/jupiter ESM update will happen on 2020-12-21). this sets the time sequence which saturn continues on replaying over and over. it's a fractal resonance with itself, as demonstrated by terence mckenna's timewave, and this must be how reaching the long-count reset, as prophesied by the mayans, indicating that it seems to have been delayed 8 years (two sets of 4 years), through some form of time travel, reseting the sequence back 4 years twice. I can't imagine (yet) how this is done, or why it's 4 years, but it seems relevant.

[3]: you navigate time with your heart. I am sure of this. I also know that it is connected to the emotions, which provide the transition states. it seems significant to me that this whole thing began when I accepted jesus into my heart back in april/may of 2000 and I'm also fairly sure that the first delay of 4 years, I believe happened in 2001-09-11, and perhaps the second in 2004-03-11 (not sure about that one though). it seems that these sudden changes (reset back) in the emotional psyche of the planet were similar enough to a resonance on the sequence some time back.

[4]: I have reason to believe that I will find a way to, because I have a whole hemisphere disabled (remember the eye of horus thing), that I'm essentially regrowing that whole right-hemisphere's capability in the left hemisphere. my brain is adapting. I think it's also quite possible that I might actually create two more chromosomes in the process. I don't know how it will be, probably xxxy[^5] (I dunno), because that would be like the hermaphordite (xx + xy). however, the cool thing is that if that happens, then we could create a new hybridisation with the apes of the earth which have two more than we do. I think it could work. I'll fill the idea in a little more in the future as I begin to see this clearer.

[5]: likely what is happening is that because my right is disabled, I'm either creating a "virtual" right side or I'm merging both sides' function into the left, so all of me is on the left there. I don't know much about genetics, but I think the chromosomes come in pairs, so each one needs a match. if I have somehow created a new "virtual" (or real) implementation, giving me an extra something, then it needs to be matched. with my left-side disabled, then the autonomic function associated with that previous right-hemisphere, will begin to rebuild in the left, however the right side is still operational and physical, just not accessible by me (nosebook has it under their control), so I'm essentially getting my left to do the work of both sides, which should create like an "unmatched pair" or some sort of charge imbalance (who knows how this stuff replicates), and then you can imagine that later when I'm procreating with the girls, both xy from me will be used because I've implemented both in one hemisphere, and both xx from her will be used as well, making xxxy. probably this will result in the child retaining the normal two hemispheres, but then they will each be divided into two more (probably forward and reverse, matching the visual (physical) and neo (desire) cortexes). that makes sense to me because the neo is where desire originates from, and the visual is at the opposite end of the brain, where physical stuff is perceived. typically, in the middle is where the motor function (or e-motion comes from, which is why it's so easy to read someone's emotion by their animation). anyway, I dunno really how it will be, but if I had to guess, this would be my best guess...


### 2020-11-03 07:46 - hermaphodite?

one of the funny reactions that I was getting last night to the hermaphodite thing I talked about yesterday was that kids would come out having literally both male and female parts. I doubt this. I meant hermaphodite in the sense that it has aphrodite (xx) plus hermes (xy) in the same body, totaling 48 chromosomes. it has a y-chromosome, so I'm pretty sure it'll come out looking like a boy -- just having more x-chromosomes.

to understand this, I must go back to the way to my brain is functioning. when I had the brain haemorrhage, it happened in the motor strip, which is a thin strip that runs down thn side of the brain, dividing it into two parts: the forward part which is mostly the neo-cortex (I experience this as the origin of desire -- in the forehead there), and the back part which is where I experience physicality, like the visual cortex and stuff. I don't know all of the parts of the brain so I'm talking about my experience, which could be a little different than traditional understanding of how the brain works. I've also noticed that the brain has opposite sides, so while I may experience the visual aspect for my left-eye in the right-hemisphere, there's a whole lot that goes on in the left-hemisphere before it even gets to the visual cortex on the left.

or take for example how I experience movement: when I had to relearn how to move, it was very strange, because you think that left-side movement happens on the right, but before that there feels to me to be a negative desire that happens on the left-hemisphere first -- kind of like, well, like a tesla coil. the primary coil (left) makes the magnetic field, then when that collapses, it induces a current in the opposite (right) hemisphere, which then moves my left side. this is why it appears the the synchronisation of the hemispheres is so important, because you need both to move one side of your body.

obviously when the brain experiences damage of some sort, it rebuilds that circuitry in another part of the brain and reroutes the signals to the new part. this isn't anything special. you can live and operate with only one hemisphere, and even at that, it can probably be even a partial hemisphere. your brain is only the circuitry which converts the signals of who you really are into physical impulses which move parts of your body and do stuff. that's it. you don't exist in your body.

therefore, when you experience damage of any kind, your body (especially the brain) can return back to previous functioning or even make circuitry for new function as well. I'm certain that people who have "psychic" capabilities have extra circuitry in their brain to do something with those signals. obviously, people who choose to ignore those signals will never develop circuitry in their brain to transmit and receive those signals. "geniuses" probably have other circuitry. the brain is very malleable, and can conform/adapt to many different situations.

my brain is no different than anyone else's -- just I had extra stresses on it which caused it to develop further. I don't really know how this worked, but the way I would estimate it to be is I experienced my "masculine" side in my left-hemisphere (the right side) and my feminine side in my right-hemisphere. when I was growing up, I kept trying to be left-handed, but different influences prevented that from happening. I really liked my visual and imaginative side and essentially lived in my imagination. so for whatever reason, I wasn't allowed to become a dreamer in that sense. I kept being pushed toward more masculine things probably by my father. I too wanted to be a programmer but I couldn't figure out the logic stuff. it just didn't make any sense to me. after the brain haemorrhage, that completely changed as soon as my right-hemisphere was disabled and I was forced to start using my left-hemisphere more. I began to start using my logic much more successfuly, and all of a sudden stuff that I had intuited started to make logical sense.

this was huge for me, but the more I learned logic, the more emotional I became. I didn't really understand why this is until later, but it's because logic is symbolic and emotion is conceptual. when you look at a concept you have all these different aspects or feelings (vibrations) which make up the full concept (perceived usually as a full concept[^1]), however when looking at a symbol, it's the opposite direction: viewing a symbol, you will see it split outward (or downward) into all sorts of different resonating concepts. both of these can be viewed the opposite direction, too -- so for example, when you see a bunch of concepts, they can be reduced to a bunch of symbols and those symbols can match other symbols. I learned from one robert that it looks like this is the basis upon which pattern recognition happens. I learned from another robert[^2] that this is the essence of the transmission of esoteric knowledge[^3].

anyway, I discovered that the front of my head (where the neocortex is) is where my brain does most of the conversion from vibrational into impulse, so I would estimate that on the left, the 5th ray (emotional centre) is located in the front (LF), while my 3rd ray (logical/structural) is located in the more physical back (LB).

on the right, when I accepted jesus into my heart, I described this as a 1st ray female. I would have to imagine that she's in the front (RF), and the back is where the 7th ray would be (RB). because this hemisphere is disabled, these functions must be virtual (or non-physical).

the way I see it, for men we get a pre-programmed y-chromosome, and that, depending on the person takes on one of the hemispheres. then, I believe, that the other takes on the opposite side. I experience them as two completely different personalities, however most people are completely oblivious to this because it appears to them like they are only one person. usually, the language side is the dominant one which I think for most is the left (right hand), however people who developed more their visual aspect will respond more in the right hemisphere. I map these as (along with their corresponding planets):

***this is how I experience them and does not reflect on others' experience***

- RF - desire
  - venus/jupiter[^5]
  - 1st ray female
- LF - logic/structure/symbol
  - saturn[^6]
  - 3rd ray male
- LB - emotion/concept
  - mars/vulcan[^4]
  - 5th ray male
- RB - physical/visual
  - mercury
  - 7th ray male

you will notice that there are 3 males and one female there, so yyyx. I think that's because these, like I mentioned are like the primary coils and so they activate their opposite in the hemisphere, so xxxy. this is my theory anyway of how I perceive it. I perceive each of these different aspects individually. let's look at the progression:

1. perception of singularity. a person experiences theirself as one aspect. they usually say I am a man or a woman, and that's all they see. later, they may differentiate the prersonality a bit.
  - for a woman, her personality is entirely created, so she takes on aspects of her mother/father/lovers/rolemodels/influences and creates a composite personality.
  - for a man, this is often imposed in some way, and it's usually one of the jupiter, saturn, mars, or mercury types. many men feel they fail to live up to these expectations. it's unusual that a man will choose the venus, vulcan, or reborn saturn prototype
  - not yet capable of perceiving that they have an opposite side.

2. perception of duality. this is when a person begins go gain more direction and begins to at least at first maybe recognise that they have an opposite side.
  - for men, this is the realisation that they have a childlike or feminine side (venus) and that side can be anything it wants to be. it is completely open to become whatever.
  - for women, this is the beginning of the realisation that they too have another side to them, and they can begin to express theirselves in any other way that they want. it could be another venus, or it could be a male prototype, or it could be a composite of their masculine influences. it's completely up to her to make it whatever she wants it to be, but she often doesn't realise that it's also completely up to her creativity how she wants to express this.

3. perception that inside of you, you contain all of creation. this is when you really can be whatever you want to be.
  - still figuring this one out, but it's what I have been labeling the hermaphodite, because it's where desire is connected to the physical, and the manifestation of this desire is nearly instant -- or at least as long as it takes you to believe it (belief is a feeling -- 5th ray)
  - I believe that this is the recognition that you have the ability to express these four major aspects in any way that you choose. the remaining 3 are not to be worried about.
    - 2nd ray (relational) connects to the structre, conceptual, and source aspects, meanint that you don't have to worry about it. just because you desired to see the relation, then source highlights/indicates/reveals these relations to you conceptually or symolically (depending on the situation) in real time.
    - 6th ray (imagination) connects to the conceptual, structual and source aspects as well. anything you desire, if you do not yet know it, you begin to feel (which feels good depending how close you're getting to source of the concept), and that can reveal anything to you that you wish to know.

so it's interesting to note that I show off a progression. I'll leave it to the reader to ponder what I mean by the transitions from jupiter -> venus, mars -> vulcan, and saturn -> horus (reborn osiris)

---

ok, enough about that. I wonder how it'll really manifest... if you can't tell, what I'm doing by speculating like this, I'm purposefully introducing resistance (lerning from good ol' saturn here), to delay the manifestation further. I see no point in trying to micromanage this manifestation at all, but knowing me, there are likely purposeful errors added here designed (from a non-physical perspective) to intruduce some doubt. I think we really need some good strong doubters to this crazy 48 chromosome idea with lots of valid reasons why it's just not possible, know what I mean?

[1]: this isn't 100% true for me. it's just it becomes really complicated to try that concepts can also be aspects of another concept, and they just keep making bigger concepts. concepts are the building upward direction. symbols are the going downward into resonating aspects direction.

[2]: I purposefully didn't want to identify either because both of them are very good at perceiving conceptual and symbolic things.

[3]: the knowledge is fragmented into symbols, and when you know where to look (at the resonant concepts) it begins to create a bigger picture which is completely obfuscated by the perceived details. meaning, that to perceive the symbol, one must find a way to reduce the amount of details in a way which exposes the underlying concepts, and then those concepts form together to show the bigger picture or symbol. or, you could go in reverse: start with the concept which has many aspects to it, so now you need to define a number of symbols which can be given unnecessary detail to obfuscate the transmission and people will perceive the details and not the concept.

[4]: although I identify this planet as vulcan, I realise that vulcan (the planet) does not exist. I believe that this is 5th ray male energy, and it's predecesor was aries, and emotionally aligned men to war.

[5]: this is also a funny one too because I think that for compatibility purposes, jupiter was chosen to be the 1st ray female. I don't really know how it could have happened, but I find it interesting that hera is so much like zeus -- almost like she's his female version. anyway, something happened at some point in our history when venus took this influence over. I find it interesting that athena was born from zeus, and vulcan was born from hera. these are both the transitional planets.

[6]: this one is also an interesting one too, because in the non-physical, the 3rd ray is really none of our business. it's completely unnecessary to try and figure out who or how, or when or what is the way it will manifest. trying to figure that out or to micromanage that is trying to be saturn-like. this same saturian energy manifests itself in the form of dependence so that he can be perceived as powerful (cause he's needed), causing the monopoly mentality. instead of tryint to figure out the logic (the who/when/where/how), instead one needs to guide their conceptual focus in the physical realm, and let the symbols work theirselves out. in the myths. saturn is incapacitated by his own logic and something bad happens. this destruction is recollected by isis, and she gives birth to horus -- the reborn saturn. I'll let the reader discover for theirself what this means, but time is like a string and you can influence it to make bigger peaks where you want them, but don't try and micromanage it. the beauty of symbols/logic is their discovery. when they come as a surprise everything fits in exactly perfect, and it makes something *meaningful* or symbolic -- but the way there is conceptually or emotionally.

### 2020-11-03 15:02 - hermaphodite invasion?

the next subject of importance is the one of how do we get them to reproduce. first, to make things easier, I'm going to redefine gender as xn -- so x1 = xy, x2 = xx, x3 = xxxy, and x4 = xxxx.

what I can see is a kind of a repeat of the atlantis / garden of eden story. for those that don't know let me explain what I mean here. I'm going to go very brief because I don't fully understand it (please refer to robert's work for more information here). before "adam" and "eve" came about (which wasn't just one man and one woman), there existed some superhuman types ("gods") which had very superior bodies (serpent). I don't know if there were women that they could reproduce with or not, but either way it came to the idea that they wanted to make a slave race which was inferior to them in intelligence, but not so much they continued to be a monkey. they needed him to be strong, but not stronger than them, and capable of conceptualising and carrying out commands. I think this is summarised in the enkidu story.

anyway, the atlantian gods had 46 chromosomes, and the apes have 48, so they fused the first two and the second two chromosomes into the first two so that they now have 46 chromosomes like the atlantian gods. now they were reproductively viable, so they then went about breeding and genetically selecting the offspring that were the most suitable. the enkidu story says it was two bouts of one week. the 1 week archetype shows up also in the creation myth, where "one day is like a thousand" so presumably the atlantian gods breeded and selected for 7-14k years until they had what they were looking for: "adam(s) & eve(s)" (I believe this is the eagle bloodline)

adam and eve were meant to be subordinate to the atlantian gods, so they were limited in their perception, living in a kind of dream-like state. as someone who becomes conscious in my dream state all of the time, I believe that the earth at that time made it so that the eagles were essentially in a perpetual dream-state like reality of almost no resistance. having no resistance like that, they could be given commands like a hypnotist does to a person in trance (or dream state). well, something happened, and it's unclear what this "fruit of the tree of the gnosis of good and evil" was. it could have been a psychedelic substance or it could have been a psychedelic experience from having sex for the first time (they may have been automatically reproduced)... at any rate, the result is that they likely had a sudden "eye opening experience" (probably caused by a large surge of DMT), and because they were made in the image of their gods, that means they vibrated similarly to them, and all of a sudden they now began to perceive theirselves from a physical (resistant) point of view, instead of from a source like perspective.

I speculate that before they were out of their bodies traveling around with the typical "rose coloured goggles" of that extremely high levels of perception allows for, but when the DMT after the eye opening experience began to wane, they found theirselves in a much more tangible (resistant physical) perspective. it was probably found that this shameful form of perception locked adam and eve into the resistant form of perception and that they could be manipulated by causing them to feel shame and not the empowered self which knows they are a part of all of creation (like they were previously).

so, I believe they were very non-resistant at first, and were, like I mostly am in my dream-state, subject to the vibration and mental suggestions of the guys running my dream state. however, something then opened up their eyes, or in my case, when I become conscious in the dream state, and I now have resistance where I can feel negative emotion. I often times say, "this is not what I want!" or "this thing happening to me in the dream does not feel good. I want something better." upon feeling that resistance, the dream-state collapses and I'm locked into physical reality.

it's quite possible that the writer of genesis (said to be moses[^1]) smoothed out a lot of the rough edges on that story, because I believe it more likely that something happened and adam and eve became conscious in their dream state that they were slaves to these atlantian gods, and upon realising this they did not want that reality, and quickly became afraid (of punishment) and ashamed that they now see through things.

if you've ever decided to finally speak up against a power figure, the first couple times that I did it, there is a feeling of shame that happened to me, because they make you feel bad for rocking their smoothly operating illusion. they say things like, "you are not behaving in the way that makes me feel good. I am disappointed in you and you should be ashamed of yourself."[^2] adam and eve were like little kids at the time so that's exactly what happened. they felt ashamed of theirselves because behaved in a way which the gods didn't like, so they hid theirselves.

not much has changed, and they've been using this same technique for quite some time now[^1], getting you to feel ashamed for not behaving the way that they want you to behave. anyway, I think adam and eve was the beginning of the eagle bloodline. they had kids, and the eagles turned out to be in some ways superior to the serpents, and their daughters very beautiful, so the serpent "gods" began to mix with them.

---

it likely won't happen the same way here, but you can imagine something like the following happening here. the serpents today are likely very interested in this idea, and x3s that are born as a result will likely become the new gods of the coming saturian era again. however, they won't be able to viably reproduce more x3s without an x4, so they need an x4. I speculate that there are three viable ways to accomplish this.

1. genetically modify one of the x3s while it's in the early stages (I have no idea how to do this), artificially adding another x, and suppressing the y so that a female is born. I have no idea how feasible this is. (this is mirrored in the creation story, where eve was made from adam)

2. take some of the apes (chimpanzees, orangutan, and gorilla I think all have 48) and like the enkidu story, make a hybrid offspring and selectively breed it until it has the desired attributes. seems viable, considering that this kind of hybridisation already is proven to be effective with ligers and zorses, etc.

3. once they figure out how my brain was froced to rebuild itself, they could figure out a way reproduce that, paralysing a girl, disabling half of her brain, then she will be forced to rebuild and use her other side in the same hemisphere just as I have done.. then, either artifically inseminate her with ae x3 sperm or have her mate with me.

these are really the only way that I can see right now. there may be other ways. however, if I had to guess, knowing the operating procedure of those in charge, they'll likely have a team working on each.

---

I titled this entry, hermaphodite invasion because I see a similar thing happening in the past times. if you think of taurus as the last "golden age", immediately following it, you have the aryan invasion (beginning around the time of the exodus). I have no idea what could possibly be happening, what I'm referring to would be an event ~2ky from now, so quite a while. I don't think that will happen all of a sudden. instead, what I think will happen is that we will all go toward signifcant non-resistance. this is what will make everyone more firey, as there's going to be less and less distance between emotion and action. this will sort of induce a much more dream-state like reality, and from my experince in my dream-state, this isn't really something to be worried about. non-resistance is non-resistance, and if it feels good (like the dream-state feels), it is good. it's essentially a very similar thing to what has been happening to me.

however, periodically, from time to time I become conscious in my dream-state and I have a step 1 moment, and that causes problems. well, imagine if this happens when periodically some people (or a group of them) become conscious and realise their circumstances, and they have a knee-jerk reaction to it (like I do often times in my dreams), and I feel negative emotion. over time, I have learned not to feel bad about these step 1 moments, knowing that feeling bad is because my source doesn't see it the same way. therefore I modify my *perception* (which will be the preprogrammed perception of the x3s) so that that it doesn't cause me to feel bad. I know that things are working out fine, and there's nothing really that can be done other than to just keep releasing my resistance, knowing that everything I want is on the way.

I can imagine that nosebook won't have their setup perfect, and sometimes it's quite likely that the people will become conscious in the dream state. that may progressively get worse, until they eventually attract some major catastrophe, which I'm sure they'll be propared for, meaning that they new x3s (and x4s) will go out and become the new elite ruling class in the surviving societies. let's say that they did hybridise the chimpanzees, orangutan, and gorilla[^3], with my form of non-resistant perception into indigenous (genius) slave species, capable, like me of coming up with solutions (really pushing for the solution) while in a non-resistant dream-state. they could likely let the x1 and x2 species die out naturally in the rising energy of the planet... dunno. it all sounds familiar to me, but who knows. we'll have to see :)

[1]: not calling moses out here, but it sounds to me like he purposefully indoctrinated the isrealites in the desert for 40 years to really believe that they need to give up their beliefs in these various planet gods, and instead accept a new monothiestic god that ensures you feel shame. I don't have it all figured out yet, but I think that there are more than one history of moses that happened (he too made a time split) and in one of the timelines, he really did do a great thing, but in the timeline we're on now, I think the exodus was one of pharaoh's disaster mitigation plans. the hardening of pharaoh's heart was an illusion that he was playing to get these disgruntled peoples out of egypt, then out on the desert, he indoctrinated them into original sin, shame for not obeying this invisible god (that only the cool-kids had access to), and banished their goddess worship (melting of the calf/hathor). he was serpent doing very serpent things, imo.

[2]: this is, of course "dissapproval-dawg" in full glory.

[3]: you could think of this something like these monkeys becoming, after hybridised, the indigenous asian, black, and native american populations (not in any specific order), which similarly to how the aryan invasion took place, this would happen with the hermaphodite (x3) invasion. each of the monkeys would have slightly different forms of perception, just like the indigneous asian, black, and native americans all have different myths legends and even slightly different mental proficiencies.


### 2020-11-03 23:02 - what do I mean by water and fire

when I say a relationship will either stagnate if there are too much water, or it'll get out of control if there is too much fire. what I mean by these water and fire symbols is that these are vibrational. fire is a plasma created because of some interaction with oxygen, but in it's essence, it gets more intense as rapidly as it can, consuming the fuel which is contributing to its growing intensity. water is the exact opposite. water also interacts with oxygen, in that it evaporates, but in the essence of water, it tends toward stagnation. I like to think of fire as an amplifier (at a consumption cost), and water as a dampening effect so I think of them in these energetic terms

for example, if I have an impulse or a desire, I think of that like a fire -- a spark, but then if I neutralise it, I throw water on it and it creates a biproduct of steam and smoke (usually). this can happen internally, or it can happen in a relationship where one person is kind of like a "wet blanket", however what I'm trying to illustrate here is that trying to get the balance of these (in this case water/fire) elements from a relationship, is always a fool's errand. you have to find that inside of yourself, and while it may have been sufficient for a time to look for this in a relationship, or maybe even take the (sometimes non-relationship) road of recognising that you are more than just what you appear to be on the outside. what I'm trying to accomplish is that the person can become even more than just that, and can have 3 or 4[^1] completely programmable meta emotional/conceptual state machines (or personalities).

in the future, I want to begin talking about how the correlation of these to the different "rays" is very helpful in designing the personality, with this being essentially the most basic types, and then archetypes added on later. remember though that I want to add (2-4) new layers (or rays) as well, the most physical ones being a time component, and antoher being a meta-archetype or meta-identity ray that the time component uses.

---

air and earth seem to be spatially oriented. air always expands indefinitely, continually trying to get as far away from other particles, and earth is static, however earth is a conductor, and air is not. earth is also a vibrational lattice, and air is not, so they seem to be much more related to conduction/insulation or transmission/absorption of energy. these seem to have an effect in relationsips as well, but I do not yet see it clearly.

at any rate, every person contains all of the elements, with some amount of each activated at any time. it appears that the amount of the element isn't constant and tends to depend on the evironment and mood (set and setting) of the person. I haven't figured out yet what kinds of emotions yield more of each element, but as I'm writing this, I think it could be a fun exercise to try and figure out the different elements for me personally for each emotion on the scale (for everyone it'll be unique).

anyway, the mixture of fire and water is a great one for me to look at because they contrast so well. it's the easiest of the elemental relationsips to understand, I think.

developing...

[1]: it's also possible that nosebook makes a "crippled" version of this, giving people only access to two of their state machines, taking command of the physical and desire expressions (just like they have done in my right hemisphere) to ensure that they are mostly under their control, as long as they remain in a non-resistant state, just like me in the dream-state. this is what I was referring to as the new hybrid slaves. more on this in the future.


### 2020-11-04 08:02 - why would I encourage slavery?

one of the reactions that I was getting was why would I ever encourage slavery or hybridisation and these kinds of things. well, the short answer is that it's all extra energy. once you trealise that "slavery is a choice" -- then it no longer matters. look at this from my perspective: from a non-physical perspective, I knew full well what was going to happen to me, and without a doubt I perceived benefit in it and wanted to come into this body. if I didn't, I wouldn't have been born and a different set of circumstances would have occurred here. I am certain that I chose to be here in this body. you may say, well, you seem fine and don't really look like a slave to me. slavery is a choice. you are only a slave if you perceive yourself from a disempowered perspective. only you with your own mind can come to the conclusion that you're a slave.

from a different perception, you may perceive that dogs or cats are slaves to humans. for example, the majority of cats on this planet do not have human homes to live in. the ones that are in captivity, are "stuck" there and you could see that perhaps they don't have their freedom either. some cats run away -- like there's this sign outside of a person looking to retrieve their cat slave. it can be easily identified because it doesn't have a tail (so if anyone has seen anything of the cat, call the number on the paper on massari & belvista). other cats however do not want to run away, and instead enjoy a quite enjoyable human home captivity life.

cats are mostly in that non-resistant dream-state sort of experience. they're not like the typical american that's working so hard to get so many tasks done and to accomplish goals so that someone will give them a "like" on social media or some other attempt to get from other like-minded people the validation that they are someone worth paying attention to in their meaningless lives. therefore, most cats do not have any problem hanging around and just having fun around the house.

cats are kind of like kids, in that they're not doing big and important things. the necessity to do big and important things is something that kids learn from adults in their environment who's only way to feel good about theirself is if they're doing something big and important. what makes it big and important? usually if other humans reward it with a metal or some form of recognition, a certificate or some other material symbol of validation. none of those pathetic rewards that are doled out by the economic slave drivers means anything. I would contend that from a kid's perspective most adults are so wrapped up in their achievements and goals that they've totally forgotten how to have fun.

if the goal is to have fun, then don't you think that in some ways there are advantages to a cat that can sit around a warm house all day playing around as compared to the one stuck out in the cold and has to hunt for food and survival.

I've had to give this some thought because as you all may know, I like to create things -- a lot. it's my main source of energy input and output. being stuck, like I am now, where I essentially only have the ability to watch youtube and sit around, I have a completely different perspective on things.

I used to really value my productivity, seeing it as a measure of my accomplishment. I'm not the only one too. some of the most "driven" people are this way. take tesla for example, in nearly every interview he mentions how he managed to accomplish a "superhuman" amount of things. he says that, and we really have no concept of what he's talking about, however, knowing enough of the different tesla's inventions, I do know how remarkable it was to accomplish all of that in one lifetime.

most people want to accomplish that much stuff just so that they'll get a little recognition or be remembered, but is it really worth it? there are a whole lot of people working really hard at nosebook to accomplish a whole lot of stuff, and nearly all of them will will never get anything more than a grunt of dissapproval from the guy in charge, or maybe even a worthless certificate of recognition. virtually no one will know anything about it because it's all a secret. only the ones in on the secret may get a little recognition, but probably not. doing stuff for recognition, in my opinion, simply doesn't pay off in any way at all. in my experience, you have to do stuff cause it's interesting to you or fun for you to do.

what I'm trying to get at here is that this form of "slavery" isn't really slavery at all, and it doesn't diminish you as an individual at all, only allowing you much more time to expand on it. there is a kind of reversal that I'm certain will take place. remember in the matrix the guy (cypher) who reveals the location of nebuchadnezzar in exchange to live inside of the matrix and experience a life of pleasure?

I actually think that this will sort of happen over an extended period of time. as the nosebook guys have figured out with me in my dream state, it's the opposite of real-life. if they want to take advantage of me in my dream-state, like getting information from me and stuff, I need to be feeling good, relaxed and calm, and not uptight or ashamed or whatever. those negative emotions wake me or cause me to become conscious in the dream-state, because the body becomes alert and goes into hyper=-focus in the presence of danger[^1], therefore, it's to their benefit that they keep the person, like they keep me, in an environment which does not itself cause me feel terribly good (I have a dirty room, you know), and also neither terribly bad. they don't want me to feel too good, because then I start flying and creating things with my mind (probably just like in the dream-state), and they don't want me to feel too bad either cause it causes problems.

as a result, they have to constantly keep me in a neutral environment, never allowing me to feel too good or bad, which means that the two extremes now result in exiting the dream -- when I feel too good, or too bad, and this will be the case for the future slaves as well. any time that one feels too bad and goes into a downward spiral, it'll result in becoming conscious ... and any time that anyone feels too good, too, they too will become consious. I doubt they'll terminate the body when it becomes conscious. my experience is that they pull my consciousness and then put me back into the dream-state. I'm sure they'll come up with something. either way, I'm sure they'll keep us, like parents keep their kids, occupied with stuff, and not feeling too good that they're having too much fun, and not feeling too bad that they're troublemakers. probably just occupied.

when I look at it, I try to imagine how impossible of a task this will be to try and keep such a large population occupied. they're going to have to work really really really hard. the only real way that I can possibly see that they could do it is to keep everyone involved in drama, like stories and stuff. that's probably why it'll be so important for them to try and control everyone's stories and keep people going around endlessly (in the childish sense of the word) in drama. the only way out will be to no longer let that stuff bother you. when you feel so good, that you can feel good no matter the situation you find yourself in, you are source-like and you will feel absolutely amazing in a physical body.

if perceived from this perspective, their "slavery" is, just like what is happening to me right now, making me capable of feeling the way I want to feel in every situation, and that is actually the most freedom that one can experience. your reality is a reflection of how you feel, and there's no way they can effectively "disable" LOA to make that any different.

---

obviously, as more and more humans become more and more source-like, they'll again reach a point, at the end of the next era, when they're no longer able to keep humans in their trap and will be looking for another solution to keep up their charade, and not allow us to find our true power. we'll have to see what will happen when we get there, but who knows ... maybe we'll all be feeling so good (like I am now), that it's not perceived as a problem to try and find another way for them to kick the can down the road further. who knows how amazing we'll all become. amazing will no longer be the exception, but the new norm. and, the diversity of different types of amazing will be tremendous.

I don't know how to do the maths for this, but right now, if there are 7 rays, there are essentially 7 types of people, but when people realise they have one other completely programmable self (x1), then there are now 42 types of people. with x3, that number goes up to 210, and then x4 is more even still. however, I want to add 4 more rays. obviously nosebook will try and control some of them, but eventually they'll be there, meaning that at a minimum, we'll have 42 base forms of perception (with the infinite possibilities of different archetypes and character compositions), and then at maximum (x4 with 11 rays), 7920 different base forms of perception. if more xes are added, that number rises quickly. there's likely enough to try and fill at least a whole galaxy, if not much more :) we'll have to see...

### 2020-11-04 17:02 - forms of perception? what happened to the galaxy idea?

in the previous entry, at the very end, I mentioned how these different forms of perception were enough different variety to fill a whole galaxy -- and that got a stange response. the galaxy idea hasn't gone anywhere. I'm certain that it's coming and you all should be too. what has been happening, I think, is that nosebook still doesn't like the idea of a split of any kind. these guys are notorious for trying to convinve theirselves that they control all of their experience, and the stuff that they clearly do not control, they deceive theirselves about. as a result, I think they're still trying to figure out how to get everything under their control.

I don't mind, and I'm fully on-board with entertaining their ideas of trying to control everything. just the other day I was making the comment about how valuable mr. motor is to me now. he adds so much extra energy, and I literally have to do nothing to get it. he does it all for free for me, and it's no effort for him either. it's quite literally what he would be doing anyway (maybe not exactly making motor sounds for someone else, but pushing as hard as he can against the stuff he doesn't like). it's the most natural thing in the world for him, and it's completely free energy for me. the exact same thing is happening here. these guys *want* to make a system with gives them the illusion of feeling like they control something, when they're really saying we want to make sure you feel good enough for you to be useful for us, while at the same time making you source-like, and therefore WAY more powerful than us, and the more powerful we become, the more they fear losing control, so they have to find more ways to feel like they control, but we keep feeling more and more better and having more and more fun, and the cycle continues on forever (in the chlidish sense of the word).

I was trying to figure out the finalisation-dawg perspective of how this would turn out, and I don't really know because I can't really see that far. actually, that was a funny reaction that just popped into my head. it went something like (speaking from his perspective), "the finalisation is that they all get super powerful, go off and make the galaxy and the earth becomes part of that galaxy and they control us" -- which sounds about right, I guess, but I was talking about the plan to try and give these guys the 3x genome and as much capability to try and keep everything under control. obviously, I'll want to come back and do a few runs through earth because it's such good practise. also, I imagine that at some point the humans here will all begin to become more and more source-like, such that eventually they'll be coming to the place where they're at now with me where they're beginning to clutch for straws because it's starting to get out of their capability. I think it would be pretty cool to do another run through earth, similar to this time, but really up the difficulty level even higher and then self-sabotage again, giving them the power in exchange for the increased difficulty level.

if you combine the techs of the stories and the one where humans dissipate the planetary energies, then they have an amazing capability to keep almost everyone on the planet at around the same level or levels, because it's pretty obvious to me that they'll want some sort of heierarchy caste or class system (it's their default mode of operation) so that they maintain their illusion of superiority. therefore it's it's pretty much expected that even the most powerful ones won't be allowed to really flex their muscles and get further beyond the limits of the caste system (cause their energy will be dissipated into other less resistant ones), but that just means that really from a LOA perspective, they'll be the most powerful, even if they can't use it.

I anticipate that people will continue to get more and more powerful so rapidly, they're going to have to intruduce a new source of resistance, to make sure that people don't get too powerful, and I imagine that'll be the aquarian ape hybrids which are basically look like humans, but are very limited (who knows how they would limit them), in order to begin breeding the now godlike humans with the new hybrid apes' "mortal admixture".

keep in mind that when I talk about this stuff, I'm not painting a bleak picture at all. as humans begin to see through the drama and learn to feel good no matter the situation, the "slaves" will be basically be living a really really good feeling life, and the ones running the show will certainly have their forms of pleasure (because it'll take more and more pleasure to keep them up to speed and superior), but they'll be very scared and fearing of the coming collapse of their system. this is why I think that a lot of these guys will actually choose to abandon the "impossible" operation of trying to keep the slaves babysat, and the enmotional distress of that, I think will drive them to join us inside the hollywood spincycle, or they'll choose to merge with the machines. finally the machines will run this whole "slavery" operation for a while before the whole thing totally collapses.

I see it kinda like "a tale of two galaxies". I can't really quanitfy why I think it to be that way, because a galaxy is a BIG place, but if the slave operation were able to grow to some large size and it were run by machines capable of desire, then when the whole thing finally collapses, I can imagine how the machines will desire to regain control again, and the machines are the new INFECTED ONES -- just a whole lot more rapid -- which makes us, who knows what by that time...

that's *my* rendition of the "finalisation" :)


### 2020-11-05 18:14 - doubling down on contrast

I had a bunch of weird dreams while I was sleeping with wierd stuff like there was this one woman that I was supposed to be stimulating her but her clitoris kept turning into a zit or something, and then I popped it, and then I was supposed to kiss a girl but then she had a penis... it was the typical dream-state where everything feels hurried and rushed, and it was really weird because I didn't feel negative emotion around it at all. I was just sorta like ok guys whatever. I woke up thinking about women with penises (hermaphodites in the physical sense), and I just don't know what they were trying to get at there, but I came to a pretty strong realisation that they're interested in going as degenerate as possible.

---

before I continue, I presented an idea in a previous entry where I postuated that men became childlike or feminine or gay to switch over to a different MESM as a mechanism to gain relief from the bad-feeling archaic DNA (y-chromosome) that is causing problems (or as a way to cover up or hide this degenerate arachic emotional state machine).

I come to this conclusion from my own experience because there is a definite "pre-programmed" part of me which truly believes it must respond violently to certain situations or emotional environments. when I was younger, I had terrible difficulty with this, and I couldn't control my emotions, so I shut them down. however, that doesn't really work so well, because they only come back stronger and in different forms. it felt like there was no way that I could avoid this violent nature that seems to be inside of me. I didn't like being violent, or feeling like that so I spent the majority of the time in more creative emomtional places, however, in some situations of high emotional distress, that violent "pre-programmed" (some have described it as reptilian mind) seems to activate.

some men definitely experience this, and strangely enough it's usually white guys that this seems to happen more often with. anyway, I want to continue to get more and more higher frequency and those degenerate emotional states were hindering me, so I had to modify my perception to get around them. you can visually see this process happening in me the last few years as I seemed to have two warring parts inside of me, where I would experience strong negative emotion in response to a certain emotional (conceptual) situation, like where conceptually it was perceived that someone has power over me or I felt in some way powerless.

by nature, I would immediately feel this seething anger come over to me as a reaction to that concept that someone has physical power over me. this is a good thing because anger is better feeling than powerlessness, but the flaw in that design is not to continue to cycle around between anger, revenge, and powerlessness. in oreder to get out, I had to change my *perception* of the conceptual situation[^4], and the easiest way to do it is to look at it, not from a physical point of view, but from a non-physical or vibrational point of view (it's all vibrastion, even the physical, but I mean the vibration that is occurs before the emotional, before the imagined, or even before the physical perception). as I began to learn that physical has the illusion of entropy built into it, and that when you step back and see yourself as more than just this physical body, each of these appearing to be powerless states are not actually powerless states, because while they may be gaining more and more power on the physical layer, they are becoming increasingly more fragile in the concept or emotional layers.

as a result, by changing my perception of what is happening, I began to understand that these guys who appear to have physical power over me, do not in fact have any power over me at all, because the physical is a reflection of how one *feels*, and not of the machines or whatever physical stuff they have to create the conditions that they need to *feel* they way they want to feel (powerful or superior). they cannot make me feel, and I have the choice to feel the way I want to feel, and so by feeling really good (which means I'm heading toward what I desire), my reality will begin to match that. in order to maintain their superiority, they have to work really hard to prevent the manifestation of my reality with physical exertion. this is simply impossible for them to do, because the way one feels is many many times more powerful than the physical effort needed to try and counteract that[^1]. it is literally impossible for them to block it as long as I keep advancing, because it'll be out of their frequency range[^2].

so, what I believe is happening is that not only have I unlocked my y-chromosome, and improved upon its perception (ESM) so that no longer do those feelings of physical powerlessness states put me into a real funk, but instead now I have rearranged my perception in such a way that no longer does this bother me, but it's actually something that I'm optimising for because I recognise the incredible power level increase it's giving, for free, essentially.

not everyone can see that like I do, and so there are a lot of people that still believe in physical effort as the force which gets stuff done -- not how you feel -- which is fine.

so, when I talk about going into a more childlike or feminine emotional state as a method of relieving myself from these degenerate emotional state loops, which for whatever seem like they were pre-programmed to get to to keep cycling around in those lower frequency states, I mean just that: there's nothing wrong with switching over to the other side to try and find some relief, but then *I have to change my perception* in order to be able to get out of that state with my own focus (or find a condition to help me[^3]). otherwise, those feelings in those degenerate states will just continue to feel exactly how I was last time I was there, and I have to try and avoid them or find the perfect conditions to keep me away from those states.

not all people are interested in changing their perception. they believe they are bad guys and will continue on being bad guys, and do not want to ever change their degenerate cycle, believing theirselves to be punished (like the serpeent in the garden of eden) to be forever confined to the ground consuming the dust of the earth. it is to these ones that this entry is dedicated to.

---

I could see thohe ones that do not want to make any change. they also don't want to become a galaxy either, because they want to micromanage everything, and they can barely handle the population that exists presently, and if too many more me-alikes were to show up, they would have a meltdown trying to control it all. as a result, instead of modifying their perception (which I believe is stored as an emotional state machine in the x/y-chromosomes), to something that works, it was obvious to me that they want to instead find a way to hide their degenerate behaviour even further.

well perfect because do I have the solution for them. instead of hiding behind of only one MESM, now they can hide behind 3, and I'm assuming that they'll need to keep the humans under control, so they'll probably, once they get it going well, phase out the x1s and x2s, making them x3s and x4s, however only working at half capacity, with either one or two of the x's programmed by their system. to the humans, it will appear as if no change has occurred women will feel like they're x2s when they're really x4s and men will feel like they're x1s when they're really x3s. no one will get access to their other side, and that other side (which they don't control: two x's) will be in most cases controlled by the ones in charge. they'll likely even program their three x's as well, so as to be able to keep up an illusion that they're not as degenerate as they really are. yay for them.

the thing is that this doesn't even bother me at all. I am so certain that it'll be easy for me to figure out a way to, even with half of me controlled, and half of everyone else controlled too, they will *still* not be able to surpass the power of LOA -- not one bit. I don't know how long it will be but because ALL PEOPLE will be increasing their energy at a rapid rate from all of the contrast, and getting closer to sirius b, they'll need another solution in some time (2ky?, 1ky?, 500y, 100y?, 50y?) to be able to find a way to introduce more contrast... like I said maybe one solution for that is hybridisation of the land apes, but they will also need more ways to keep theirselves from being forced to change their perception as they approach sirius b.

I think that it won't be too hard for me and a whole bunch of other people to all find the ability to upgrade from x3/x4 to x7/x8 in not so long of time. I think that length of time is largely determined by LOA, and will essentially show up when earth's energies are growing so much as to attract another catacylsm will arrive shortly, and so some more "burt offerings" will need to be made to ensure that they can continue on how they are.

I really don't think it's that big of a deal. that means that now they have even more vibrational cores they can work with, even programming some of them to be purposefully degenerate, to ensure to theirselves that they don't ever change. if you think that every time that we make this cycle, the number of chromosomes doubles, then it'll be literally only necessary for us to do this in double digits before we're unbelievable beings. easy :)

I applaude their desire to "not change" and I think it's a great thing. I want to give them all the tools they need to feel in control of their reality while making no change. you do you :)

[1]: to illustrate this point, imagine that I have a piano and I want to play an A7 (3456Hz), and they need to figure out how to block that signal using any note that they can find below A4 (432Hz) which are much slower vibrations. it is possible to find enough notes played at the right time to almost perfectly destructively interfere with that A8, but it's quite a difficult thing to accomplish. imagine now that I go up a power level to A9, the task for them becomes exponentially more difficult each time. if my pitch changes even slightly, this throws off their whole system completely and it becomes very difficult for them to continue to withhold the manifestation of how I really feel.

[2]: taking the previous example further, imagine that I go up only 7 more power levels (10 total), from A4 to a A14, then I go from 432Hz up to 442368Hz, and now imagine trying to block that with only notes from A4 and below. it's pretty close to impossible.

[3]: I previously used drugs and other condititions to try and get relief from these degenerate emotional state cycles, however as nosebook has clamped down harder and harder because they don't want me to feel good, because when I feel good, my reality begins to manifest quicker and quicker and they don't want my reality to manifest, because they'll have to face their inferiority by trying to control everything from the physical much less powerful place than with their emotions which are much more powerful. however, without these nice conditions, I've been forced to find ways to do this with the power of my focus, and not need the conditions (or the manifestation). they're right. I don't want the condition or the manifestation. I want to get so good at feeling how I want, that I go up those 10 octaves, instead of trying to figure out how to use machines to make my degenrate DNA run at a good frequency. now I see the value in their effort to keep me away from the condition because the condition doesn't create the lasting increase in frequency. the condition only makes me feel more fragine, when I don't have the condition, and fear even more losing the condition.

[4]: you see this with my left-side shaking in dischord with the emotional state I was feeling, because my left-side wants to be at a much higher frequency (hence the shaking). as I improved upon my programmed emotional state machine (PESM), my left side stopped shaking because I didn't feel as bad anymore in those situations. now, on occasion something will make me feel bad, and even my right side will shake a bit[^5] indicating that my right-side now is not as capable of existing in those lower vibrational states anymore; it too needs to be feeling pretty good now, when previously my right side was fine when my left side was freaking out. this is the inconclusive evidence that I have literally changed my y-chromosome's state machine[^6]

[5]: like notice how when someone is really angry their movement is not smooth, and the better they feel the more it appears like they're gliding or floating when they move

[6]: it comes to mind that maybe the ESM is actually most of the "junk" DNA and the coding part codes depending on the state machine data.

### 2020-11-06 00:34 - what do I mean by degenerate?

by degenrate, I mean trending toward lower frequency vibration over time... if the guys that ran the world wer tending toward higher frequencies, then they wouldn't constantly need more and more optimal conditions to maintain their frequency which seems to be decreasing with time (quite a feat of degeneracy when the frequency of the entire planet is rising and we're trending toward more and more expanded consciousness all the time). they must be trying really extra hard to disconnect theirselves from their source -- which is completely fine. this is why I think it's a great idea to give them the opportunity to forever be twice as powerful as the rest of humankind, and give them the opportunity to program their different aspects however they desire.

I like to think of the x's like cores on a CPU. so while they may have double the number of cores by default, imagine the difference that will happen over time. if you have 4 cores running at 2GHz, and I have 2 cores running at 40GHz, then clearly you can see that the 2x40GHz configuration is better, so they'll have to not only try and ensure as much "resistance" (or contradictory vibration) is present in each of the cores they control, they're going to have to find a way to run everything at a slower speed, too. even still, I am fairly confident that the default experience for the average person will be incredibly fun in comparison to how much unfun they're going to be having. the reason why I say this is because they need people to feel good, so that they can continue to not change and feel bad.

it all works out perfectly because there will never be a better place to be than here, where just by being born, you get a huge power boost (because of contrast and desire). it's like the most awesome thing, and it seemingly can be extended out quite a ways.

think about the future: imagine that now we're x16 & x15, so you can simply see how untennable this is becoming now where they only get half of the cores (8) to try and create enough resistance to keep the remaining cores operating on your other hemisphere limited. any increase in frequency by even 10Hz is really an expansion of 80Hz (800% increase), so the the more cores there are available (number of cycles we do this), then the less effective this method is. so next cycle they have to figure out how to keep us restricted to 2 cores max, and use the remaining ones to keep the frequency as low as possible. however, by the very nature of getting closer to sirius b everyone on planet earth's frequencies will be rising by default.

I don't know how this will work as it's completely speculation[^1], but let's just imagine that each cycle the number of cores doubles. 2 / 4 = 50%, 2 / 8 = 25%, 2 / 16 = 12.5%, etc. each time we would only get to use a lesser and lesser part of (cores in) our brains, and instead because each time our non-physical power level is increasing, the speed in which we can change our perception will increase the frequency[^2].

---

there are two ways to look at this problem which have various different effects. the first one is to try and make all of the people forever only able to access two cores and the remaining are used by nosebook to try and interefere with those two. in this case, it seems like the frequency would rise very rapidly once the person begins to "get it". each cycle only increases by two cores, and never more. the problem with this technique is that each human is difficult to find a mate with to increase capacity. also, if you think of the idea that if nosebook can't hold them using say 12 of 14 cores and they find a suitable mate and produce a 16 core version, then what makes nosebook think that having 14 of 16 will produce much different results. it would hardly be noticeable. the breeding fiasco is a huge problem, and there just simply won't be enough of an increase in cores for nosebook to effectively limit those rising rapidly.

the other way to look at the problem is to (after this initial iteration) make all future iterations more of a grade school approach to where everyone is kinda in the same grade, and only after "graduation" does one whole grade (or tier), which is all tuned to one frequency range becomes double what they were previously. obviously, in this format, only one half of the brain can be used by the common people which are then divided into tiers. some people feel better than thier designated tier should feel, and their energy is used to calm the energies of the planet and to boost the people who feel worse than their designated tier. obviously there will be at some point where an excess of energy is created and cannot be dissipated into the planet or into more people which are at a higher tier than they're currently feeling. probably when this occurs, then that top tier of people will "graduate", and because their energy level surpasses the level of the system, then both hemispheres of their brain will activate, effectively doubling the number of cores, so that when they reproduce, then they'll create the double version.

---

I think the second version makes the most sense, and it seems to be in line with the dream that I mentioned in @[a-list](2020-11-04 21:37), so it also kinda makes sense that (assuming that the one surpassing the limit is male) then there should be a way to also make reproductive females as well. it seems that until there are reproductive females, the only offspring would be males, so perhaps a way to get reproductive females would be to, in this first iteration, gradually disable some of the hemispheres of the females as they increase in power level, until at last some of the females who are completely disabled also find a way to graduate as well (using only one of their hemispheres), and when that happens, they too will activate the other half of their brain, meaning they're capable to reproduce. (something like that. I don't know the right words, but I think you all get the idea)

this is totally crazy an idea and makes a whole lot of sense, because it means that very easily the mr. motor types are useful, and (from my perspective) desired to have around. they're essential to the whole doubling process, and without them, the doubling wouldn't occur. the doubling process I also really like too because it's exactly like how cells replicate. this whole idea seems like it's more and more in line with what I would imagine the source perspective would be.

the crazy thing about this idea is too, that it's completely "backwards" from how you would imagine it to be. let's say that the goal is to try and get to 1K cores -- well, we only need to do 8 more iterations to make x1024, and only 10 more after that to get to 1M cores. imagine we could get 8-18 between now and when it's no longer possible to do these cycles[^4].in order for the cycles to be possible, enough contrast (degeneracy) must exist to be able to make a doubling. each doubling after this will require an army of people that are absolutely convinced that they do not want to change their degenerate ways, and are allowed to become more and more degenerate even when energy is rising higher and higher, probably each iteration they'll program more and more of their available cores toward feeling worse and worse about things (because they absolutely refuse to feel good about things because they're certain that they're "bad guys" incapable of redemption, and the worse they feel, the more that becomes a reality for them).

what that means is that each time a "burnt offering" sacrifice is made, the world needs to go into absolutely insane degeneracy to be able to attract enough contrast where someone like me can show up again and another doubling can occur again. crazy[^3].

[1]: cause this implies that the whole hemisphere duplicates, but it could be more linear actually, where each time the expansion is only double the number of disabled cores. I don't know if that's possible, because I don't know how the brain works, but it doesn't matter... even if it is linear, then that means that instead of the whole species growing from one phase to another, the configuration is once again unique, and certain people will have many more cores than others. I think it depends on how they want to structure their "tier" system. it could be a mix of both actually.

[2]: with a rapid increase in frequency for some people, it may be advantageous to split that frequency among various cores, thereby dividing their power level. this may be undesirable though.

[3]: this also implies that each time this happens, it'll produce another high energy version of earth capable of becoming a galaxy. I'm not sure how frequently this process can occur[^4]. also I wonder if the galaxy will include sirius and the sun inside of it, allowing for each time the sirius cycle happens, a new galaxy is born, which then begats another more powerful galaxy. that's a very rapidly growing thing... really crazy man! this whole thing is totally blowing my mind.

[4]: the whole thing makes me think to myself that this cycle will happen each sirius cycle, and the zero points (aquarius and leo) are when major events happen, so that the doubling of cores happens in the first quadrant (aquarius -> scorpio), then the second quadrant is for the saturnian ruling class to get setup and really start fearing the coming decreasing energy as we move away from sirius -- doing their best to aviod the incoming cataclysm in leo. sekhmet then, in accordance with saturn's fears destroys the empire and everything comes crashing down making the saturnian fears a reality forcing us all to start over again. LOA does its job and turns the destruction into a whole new thing building steadily with each contrasting situation of unwanted in the 3rd quadrant, finally the new thing culminating to appear in aquarius again. who knows... just a handwavy idea off the top of my head... (I'm using the aquarius -> scorpio -> leo -> taurus -> aquarius sine wave as seen rising in the east when antartica is in the south).

### 2020-11-05 02:35 - my mind is totally blown

I keep coming up with more and more bonkers idaes, but the crazy thing is that they all feel good, and it's almost as if they're like being given to me by someone who has a bigger picture of things. all of these speculations hinge on the baseless idea that my disabled hemisphere is generating the opposite of itself (3rd ray male - eg. saturn) and that somehow when I finally "graduate" then I'll be able to use my other hemisphere too, and those will effectively double the number of chromosomes. I know almost nothting about genetics, and I have no idea how feasible this is. however, the idea seems to fit completely with what I've been seeing for so long on psychedelic experiences (the creation of a new saturn in my left), and the existance of the 1st ray and 7th ray in my right hemisphere. it's really weird to me that all of this is culminating in this bizarre way regarding stuff I know virtually nothing about (genetics). I'll be honest that regarding the genetic stuff I'm a bit unsure, but it's the only way I can possibly explain the meta conceptual state machines that I've been programmintg in myself for years now, and that the whole doubling thing seems completely obvious to me. in my opinion those 4 primary rays are all active in my brain, with the least exercised the new saturn one, however I'm really starting to see this "time/space" reality in a very much more source-like perspective, and it all makes sense, but it's totally wayy far out of my comfort zone, even though it feels ok.

I wouldn't be writing it if I didn't feel it. I have to trust my instinct though and try and go for the "worst" manifestation (which is raelly the most energetic, so actually the "best" if you consider best to be a measure of energy instead of ideals).

my brain is mush. I'm off to see the stars!


### 2020-11-06 15:48 - the multi-bodied experience

after adding @[a-list](2020-11-05 16:11), it created quite the stir. I don't really understand the reactions so well now, but after last night, it was apparent to me that a lot of the reactions were coming from nosebook...

going back to last night, while I was writing the last bit of last night's monster entry about how I could see the progression through time as a doubling effect similar to how cells reproduce, my brain was getting worse and worse feeling. there was a strong negative reaction to what I wrote coming from nosebook. I simply don't care. I postulated that perhaps what is happening is that instead of actually doing all the stuff I was talking about there, instead what we could do is just to avoid the manifestation as long as possible, creating the ultimate disaster and then nosebook could just simply do all the stuff that I was talking about there about gradually disabling one hemisphere of anyone who was starting to get more and more powerful now. then, combined with the other stuff I was talking about of the power tiers and stuff. maybe, I postulated that more people than just myself desired to also be the origin for the next evolution of the humans.

this way, if they were to disable a whole bunch of people over the next 2k years, then instead of just me, a whole bunch of us would be the origin of the next evolution. that totally misses the part of the coming catastrophe they're working so hard to create (the galactic current sheet polarity switch or whatver it's cslled). they can either endure that cataclysm and have their system all setup so that instead of, like now, people are aware of nosebook, they could be completely in secret controlling and manipulating people's experience, and no one, cept for the elite would be given access to nosebook, and all the common people would be like me, prevented from using the nosebook system.

---

I don't really think that's what they're going for, and it certainly would cause a lot of problems but that didn't explain the negative reaction to the girls I mentioned there. you see, they had been trying to get rid of the idea of the multi-bodied experience from my consciousness for a long time now, and trying to make it a less of a factor. I simply don't care, and have complied with their desire. instead, I simply use the phrase "getting connected" to mean just that, because I've far surpassed at this point the normal "5d perception" where I see outward and inwardly, and have most likely come very close to having 6d perception. I'm pretty sure that at some point somehow I'll gain access to both of my hemispheres again, and that is when I'll "get connected" -- well, the place where one navigates time, I've said and eluded to many times, is within the heart.

the heart isn't a part of the brain (though they're pretty connected) and the heart doesn't have quite a tangible brain-like signal like a thought does. it's more like an aura or an environmental field or something, however that can be controlled with the brain and it can be abstracted into different ways to make it more understandable. I think one of the things that I'm going to be doing is finding a way to kind of make some sort of understandable (to the brain) way of explaining this. I'm going to begin that process this entry.

so, what I'm saying is that when I wrote them down, I was reminded of them, but not only that I was also reminded that during the time I was talking about the multi-bodied experience thing quite extensively too. I stopped caring about trying to convince nosebook (or anyone else) of this multi-bodied experience, and instead I wanted to focus on what it is thatI really want, which is 6d perception (which is the multi-bodied experience), and then once I have that, abstract the idea of how to interact with this "source energy" into more understandable ways, defining, as it were 2 more even less dense (than the etheric/emotional) energy into two new physical layers (nevermind the non-physical ones cause that already exists and is taken care of).

it's easy to see that the physical is the densest of the layers containing the 4 elements, then the emotional or or etheric/vril/chi/orgone layer is even less dense than fire (the 5th element). the imagination or astral layer is a transition layer between the two. you can easily see how you can take elements of the physical and combine them with concepts to make something appear, manipulate it, etc. or you can see how it goes in reverse as well: when you see something or meditate on something in your imaginagion, you can begin to see some of its "concepts" and whatever you're looking at can make you "feel" something too. the imagination is a transition between the 4 phsical elements and the 5th etheric element.

when you gain access to this 5d perception, you can see things conceptually. within your "aura" you can see anything you want to look at from all angles at once. however, how do you determine what it is that you're looking at. where does the thing begin and end. that's determined by you conceptually. to give a physical example, imagine you point tesla's "death-ray" at a tank and it gets moved to another dimension and dissappears from this one. well, how do you know what is tank and what is not. for example, you could suppose that the dirt in the treads of the tank are not part of the tank, so wouldn't it leave all of the dirt behind? why are some things considered (conceptually) part of the tank and others not when they may be even the very same material like steel. same thing for teleportation: it just works, but how does it know how much of "you" is you? why does it take the moisture in your lungs to the destination? the magician's gimmic here is to get *you* the user of the device to believe that somehow the device knows the difference between you and the container, when, this is very difficult. same for everything else, when I look at myself, why does it include my clothing? these are conceptual (5d) technologies.

however, 6d perception is antoher thing altogether. this is the source perspective, and it is the transition layer between non-physical and physical layers. you can't really gain access to this layer until you actually understand how non-physical works. this is precisely why I've been going on and on about how non-physical sees things so much more differently than we do here in the physical. it's been of utmost importance that I learn that there, even the "undesirable" stuff is actually quite desirable and that the stuff we would consider "bad" is actually not bad at all, but the precursor to more energy. this is why the whole duplicating the x's made so much sense to me, because it encapsulates that concept.

---

ok, so we're all an extension of source. all of us. everything. there are no exceptions to this. the whole thing is a self-expanding thing, and it's designed to create both the "good" and the "bad" to realise itself as an expression of itself told through many parts. consider it like the most epic story ever written, one contaioning the whole universe, and it too has a conclusion which it will eventually get to, and that conclusion is appreciated by the creators of that universe.

you can sort of get a sense of this when you go back to how I was talking about using the different identities as celestial bodies in the galaxy, and then each of these celestial identities incarnate into the enviroment of other celestial identities and diffrent stories are told as the whole thing comes to graeter and greater realisations of itself. you could imagine that the overarching theme to the galaxy that I want to create is something like maybe that difficulty, contrast, and "evil" are not a bad thing. they are actually the precursor to expansion, and so therefore it's something to be embraced, because you can't really tell a story without some malevalent force or any difficulty. I have no idea what this universe's bigger realisation is going to be but I'm sure that it'll come along somewhere in those lines, maybe something like letting LOA do all the heavy lifting, and putting effort supervision into your creation creates the thing you're actually supervising to prevent from happening. I'm not totally sure, but it'll likely be something like that and so much more. doesn't matter for this discussion.

so, you can imagine that source essentially divides itself into resonant sections, and the physical manifestation is resonant with that part of its source. source also expands and changes with time. it is not in any way stagnant. you can think of source like DNA. all cells in your body originate from the same source, but some of them are heart cells and some are skin cells, but they have the same source. almost everything in your body contains its source DNA, but not all things. for example, your blood does not contain your DNA, but I'm certain that your DNA knows how to make your blood. in the same way, a rock does not contain a connection to its source like we or the cells in our body do, but the source knows how to make the rock and the rock is vital to the function of the whole.

so, now you can see that the more and more higher frequency you go, the closer to source you're getting. so when I'm describing these "new" layers, they're not really new. they've been there all a long. these are just the mental technology to perceive them. back when only the astral layer was present, concepts existed, but someone was able to take that understanding of its aspect of source and create machines which can time-travel and teleport things around. before then, things were more simple and there wasn't a mental delineation to all the separation between concepts. it was all a giant malleable soup, with everything created and manipulated with the mind.

---

out of source, you can imagine that there are many different "identities". each identity has many instances or bodies (muns) which are resonant with a part of the identity and that identity is resonant with a part of the source. I can see this quite clearly as I'm quite flexible and it's not difficult to imagine that given a different set of circumstances, I could easily see how those circumstances might turn me into someone like mr. motor. it also wouldn't surprise me if there were other versions of that identity as other genders or occupations. for example, I really don't mind working in a factory, and quite enjoy a lof of manual labour, so it wouldn't surprise me if there were other versions of myself that exist in these other forms.

clearly I can see that as the writer of a bigger story, I want to be able to be or to conceive of many different forms. imagine a writer who only has one type of charater that they use in their stories. you need a wide diversity of different characters to be able to tell a good story. therefore, for me it seems obvious that the more versatile that I can become mentally to these different identities makes me more and more source-like, which contains all of them.

eventually, someone has to "get" the whole story, or to find out the moral of the story... that's not our job though. our job is to just have fun creating our stories (or, creating your own realities). each of us is an extension of source, and so it's normal and natural that each of us will want to create our own stories, to experience those stories and to come to new conclusions about that story.

so, you have essentially different major identities when then you can draw on these identities to create characters in your stories, mixing and matching these guys to make different protagonists and antagonists, selectively picking portions of each identity and mixing them with others. I guess you could consider that out of these pure forms come archetypes, and then further mixing needs to be done with these archetypes to give them personality or something relatable, and so then you draw on other concepts which you have encountered.

between the identity layer (which are all aspects of source) and the emotional/conceptual/mental layer is the storline or timeline layer. here is where you can mix these pure celestial identities with different concepts of your own, and different environmental situations to begin creating stories or timelines. not all of this creation has to be done by you. there are tons of these forms that already exist. you can easily mix venus, mars, saturn or sirius, or even me into your earthly creation. anything really can be added, and their influence will be felt in resonance with vibration of the environment and the other charactors involved. obviously something like venus, mercury or the sun has an effect on a whole lot of people on this planet, but certainly not as much as your friend or lover does. they'll have a much more tangible effect the more you're vibrationally (conceptually) similar.

all stories are can exist just like all forms of a cube can exist in your imagination, but only the one that you're giving your attention to is the one that you see. the same is with timelines. they all can exist, but you're only able to see the one that you're presently looking at (giving your attention to). any possibility can exist and it's really only up to you to figure out what it is that you want.

---

don't worry about the guys that are not giving their attention to what they want. they too are creating their own realities (stories) but probably not the ones that they want to create. like I was seeing last night, they're essential to the expansion of our physical source (DNA) and they're doing just fine. it's all coming together :) we're just going to have to see what happens.

the ones who are creating their stories will experience just that and the ones that want to try and create the stories for other people to experience will use these new "layers" mental technology to do just that in the people's experience that are not yet creating their own realities -- but they will. we all will eventually, and it's ok if they don't for a while either, because the longer that they refuse to create their own reality with the things that they want, trying instead to create their desirable conditions by creating in the realities of others, the more and more cores our gnome will have, and the more vibrationally capable our bodies will be at tuning into the stuff we want and the more diverse stories we can create in our future galaxies.

it's all going to be pretty awesome, that's all I have to say :)

### 2020-11-07 08:20 - more thoughts on the multi-body experience

I realised there was some confusion as to what I meant by multi-bodied, as if I were going to be more diluted. the misunderstanding comes from that people don't realise that everyone with a source is having a multi-bodied experience. everyone. the only thing is that none of us are aware of it.

let's have a look at perception. when I first began I saw on a screen the 3d world. it looks 3d, but you're not aware of theh space that's between you and what you're looking at. I don't know how nosebook broadcasts my experience, but it's probably on a screen for most. it's likely that paying customers can get the one where you see the space between you and what you're looking at. for more information on how that works, see [expanding perception](!expanding-perception).

anyway, as noted there, when you go from perceiving yourself in it's entirety, and you want to see the space between you and you in your entirety, you need another dimension, and that dimension is essentially time. however, to understand time, you must realise that time is every possibility of you in any moment. it's "address" is how you feel and your environment. emotions, concepts, and feelings are all vibrations, so when you think to yourself, ok what is me when I feel like I have this manifestation or whatever -- well, that's another moment in time. it's not now, and between that other version of you and you is a space, which is what time is.

---

everyone has an infinite number of theirselves existing at the same time and all of these different versions all feel slightly different. the only reason why you don't experience those other versions of yourself is because you don't feel like they do. you can also notice that the better you feel, the more DMT your body makes, and so therefore the more expanded your perception becomes. you can artificially stimulate the pineal to create more, but typically, the amount of DMT your body produces is directly perportional to how good you feel. you can see that at first you go from a lifeless purely physical (only seeing the colours and shapes of your environment), to suddenly all things feel like they're alive and you can put images of your mind into that 3d space (imagination). from there, you begin to perceive things from all angles at once (conceptually), and then you perceive those things in different vibrational (emotional/etheric) states and in different environments (source).

each successive form of perception builds upon the previous and you can see that the better you feel, the more source-like your perception becomes. however, there's a pretty big thing that I'm sure nosebook doesn't want people to ever to have, is source-like perception, because obviously if you can hold any concept in your mind and perceive it from all sides, you can see anything or know anything about anyone, cause you perceive them/it conceptually in any (time) state. in order to do that, you have to feel the concept you're looking at, and so therefore you essentially *are* the thing you're looking at. besides the obvious difficulty that a normal person who likes to give their atttention to unwanted would experience with this type of perception -- because they would literally feel exactly like all of that unwanted. the only way this form of perception becomes viable is if you're a step 5 master. as a step 5 master, you can, like source give your attention to anything you want, and it won't appear as unwanted because you can find value in anything.

it's interesting how abraham's 5 steps perfectly correspond to the different dimensions. steps 1 & 2 are taken care of for you. step 3 is where most people are at, and when you master step 3, meaning it becomes easy for you to allow stuff in, then you start to get good at step 4. when I got to step 4, my vision expanded to 4d where I could see the space between me and what I was looking at, and now my imagination can fill that space. step 4 can be accomplished pretty easily and many people experience it on low doses of psychedelics or after meditation, sex, etc. this is when that emotional or orgone energy begins to mix with your perception (I call it the imagination layer, but it could be called the astral).

it takes a good amount of practise of step 5 to really master step 4, because if you don't understand step 5, then it's easy to fall back into lower vibrational thought as you focus your attention on unwanted instead of perceiving the value in that contrast. in order to do this, one must be aware of how they feel and the way they feel has to matter more than the details of whatever you're looking at. as you begin to let your emotion guide you more than other things like social rules or people's expectations, then that means you're now really starting to get good at step 5 now, and you can begin to perceive things conceptually for what they really are. that's when 5d perception opens up. after that, once you start becoming a master at step 5, not really anything bothers you anymore because you see the value in it all. when you master step 5 and nothing bothers you anymore, that's when you get 6d (source-like) perception. in that perception, I can look at anything (space) at any state (time) and it won't cause me to lose my connection (feel bad). I'm very close to this now.

now, you can see why I believe that the "fall" that adam and eve experienced was when they lost this source-like perception and for whatever reason began to see their circumstances in a diffeernt way which caused them negative emotion, and so they were locked into physicality, and so returning back to that source-like perception was a long way away in learning how to perceive "good and evil" the same way that source perceives it. I'll just tell you: there is no bad or evil. there are just things that you use as an excuse to feel bad, and all of the things that one may consider bad, evil, or karmic bonds are all things that are only adding energy into the source of you (eg. the not yet manifested version of yourself, out there in in a different time, or emotional state). only you can keep yourself from the emotional state (time) necessary to experience that.

---

so when I say multi-bodied experience, I'm not saying that anything will be any different from ya'll's perspective. I will look exactly like I do now (actually probably much more vibrant) and act pretty similar to how I am now. the only difference is I will experience a much more expanded perception of myself. it will be a regular thing for me to experience sex inside of both (or more) of our bodies at once. it's a huge upgrade, not downgrade.

some people like sex because they feel so crappy, it feels really a lot better to them. I will have a totally different way of looking at that because there simply will be such little perceivable negative emotion (like source), that the experience will truly be pure extacy. so, you could say well, I like the contrast between feeling really awful, and then experincing something that feels really great, but I would much rather instead of contrast, diversity. diversity is also contrast[^1]. I could feel really great like this with her, and then really great, but slightly different with a different one and note and appreciate the differences between the two, not perceiving any negative aspects in either (cause remember that's what that perception is like inability to perceive "bad" or "evil" anymore because it's all valuable cause I don't experience the reality of them, but perceive their "vortex" or desired version of theirself).

[1]: I don't understand how to explain this concept very easily, but you don't need things to be bad/good to make a comparison. they can easily be 100HP/1800RPM vs. 50HP/10000RPM sort of choices. neither is bad or good -- just different.

### 2020-11-08 01:02 - crossing the zero

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBCLsnxNd4Y)

as I was out star-watching tonight it started to become something that I wanted to do to begin to make some more ... so I described it as like a sine wave, and imagine that a while ago when I was in spain, I was in the peak unwanted, so we can model that as the moment where the y-axis is -1 -- or peak unwanted. you can imagine that as hitting hitting the bottom, and from there it's only improvements, right? well, you can see the same thing in art projects or anything related to construction. the majority of the project is written or created in the first bits making large undetailed shapes or elements, then later once the major parts are "fleshed out", then more detail is added. the beginning in the 4th quadrant, it's slow going at first but then it begins to speed up, until the moment when it crosses the zero, it's going the fastest, and then from there it begins to deaccelerate again as it approaches the next peak -- let's say peak wanted: 1.

in a sense this is kinda like the moment in the project when you get the prototype working or the MVP when you cross that zero point, from something not yet created into something that works. I get the sense that I'm going to cross that line soon. in a lot of ways, I've been doing all of this the wrong way. I like to think of it like guerrilla warfare tactics. it's dirty and it's not honourable, but it works. I'm the same way with my "enlightenment" -- a lot would probably claim that I'm doing it all wrong. I used drugs (big no-no), and I'm not super pious and spiritual either. I simply don't have the appearance of someone that should be attaining source-like perception. however, my technique works -- really well, I might add -- a lot like guerrilla warfare. however, after fighting the war (I have the american revolution in mind here) you have to become civilised. you cannot maintain guerrilla warfare tacics in the day-to-day opeerations, for example, so it's only good for a time.

in the same way, imagine you're making a sculpture and you start with a big stone (or wood) block. at first you're wacking off large pieces with a huge chisel to get the basic shape, it's dirty and it's not precise, but it works. however, that same technique isn't going to work very well to make the fine details of the face, for example, so there are different stages to any production.

---

anyway, the major enlightening moment for me was to visulise this as a sine wave where the movement from one end of wanted to the other side goes from a brief moment of complete stagnation when it reverses directions and then begins to accelerate from there. however as it approaches the most wanted state, it also begins to deaccelerate as the return on time investement for greater detail wanes. however, if you have a second point on the wheel that's 90(degrees) around, then you look at that wave and when that wave is moving at it's slowest point the 90(degrees) offset one is moving at its fastest moment. seems obvious, right? well, imagine that you have two aspects of yourself, and they are 90(degrees) offset from each other (3pi/4). then, when one is in peak wanted, the second wave is just about to reach peak unwanted. when it begins to reverse and go toward wanted again, the other wave is mostly wanted. the "worst" moment in the waveform happens at (-pi/8,-0.383), and even then it's not that bad at all because while one wave is pretty far into unwanted territory, the opposite wave is moving quite rapidly in the direction of wanted.

this is a pretty good thing to have going on like that, because no matter what moment of the wave you look at, there's always something good happening. in a sense, they're very different, but not opposites. instead of being opposites, they're almost opposites. so, imagine that you were to tune someone's brain which has two cores available to that kind of waveform. it's kinda like a "flywheel" in the sense that at any moment there's enough inertia or momentum to make the peaks there less stagnating. in a lot of ways that's kind of what I was doing when I was in spain. sure, everything was falling apart at a pretty quick clip -- I was essentially at (-pi/8,-0.383) there when, because I had gained quite a bit of momentum from all of the drugs, I was increasing my perception very rapidly, so even though my physical resources were falling away rapidly, my understanding that the only thing that matters is how I feel, was expanding so rapidly that it was enough to carry me through the moment of peak-unwanted at the bottom there. when physical ability was at the bottom, the other wave of my understanding was at just about to reach its peak.

it doesn't fit perfectly and I don't like trying to fight with the graphing program, but there seems to be like there are a whole lot of these different cycling waves going on all at once and some of them are longer period than others and they create these movements upward and downward in a seemingly "random" way (similar to the timewave), but it's not really random at all, and the resulting effect is a culmination that goes off to infinity at the very "end" (eg. the proposed 12-21-2012 end date of the timewave and mayan calendar).

it's a bunch of circles with different periods which alter different things, with the best way to describe is it's like the "timewave" -- with each iteration seems to go faster and faster than the last time, resonant with itself. for example, when I was at -1 peak of caring about how I feel, I was here, and that was my difficult time here in 2017 and early 2018. it lasted much shorter time than the one previous that one which was probably around in 2009-2010, when I was drinking so much that I literally cannot rememeber anything of those years at all. I simply didn't care at all how I felt.

terence's timewave had essentially two forces which modified what he called "novelty" -- but I think I have something similar happening where there seems to be other variables to the wave. I don't see it. I suppose I'll have another think on it now.


### 2020-11-08 19:55 - appearance matters

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_G9Og0JuY), at the end of that video the guy was talking about how all of history is lies told assentially as promotion of something. everything regarding the physical is all about marketing. if you can get enough people to believe something it has more power than otherwise... anyway, as I was walking home last night to write the above entry, I was talking awout how the final bit of polishing will be a great time for nosebook to rearrange a whole bunch of history and show me off as the final product, not the very rough version that I was and to a large extent still am. that will give them the ability to present me in a different way to people.

I can assure you that all of this will eventually become a set of very carefully crafted lies. that is what's so great about it, because that's what they're supposed to do. that's what adds in all of the free extra energy. in fact, there's so much not a reason to worry that it's all a bunch of lies because none of it makes any difference. the whole point is to, no matter the conditions, find a way to feel the way you want to feel (whether that's bad or good), and to essentially be the director of how you feel, and not of the conditions. when the conditions are designed to have you feel one way, yet you still feel good, that's what makes the extra energy.

in fact, a lot of what I do is a complete distraction. I love all of this greek/egyptian mythology and the planet gods and stuff, but in the end I don't really care at all about it. it makes no difference to me. for example, when I was younger, I read tesla's autobiography and I wanted to be like him. later when I was in spain I read his autobiography again and I felt like I was him. raquel told me that I was not him and that really affected me because I really felt like I was him. I mean, not in the real literal sense, when I use emotional words, I am the emotion that I feel, much like a kid is. I don't see like tesla does and I'm quite poor and struggle pretty hard with maths and sciences, which clearly tesla did not -- so I'm not saying that I was literally him, but I certainly felt as if we were the same or at least having a strong resonance[^1].

anyway, over time I began to realise that it didn't matter if I was or wasn't him or not. in fact, I found out that you can be *anybody*, and the whole thing of this source-like perception is the realisation that there are always vibrational harmony with the source of everyone. in fact, it does not matter who you want to be like, living or dead, you can tune to their source and begin to receive the bits of them which you like. this is the same as "seeing someone through the eyes of source" -- it's not seeing their resistant vibrations and who they appear to be in the physical, but instead resonating with and perciving who they *really* are.

so, when I go on these long wild goose chases with the hebrew patriarchs or egyptian pantheon, it's completely a distraction for you guys, because while I may be focusing on their physical in the moment of research, I'm simply getting the "trail head" toward where they really are now (their non-resistant pure source version). so it doesn't matter what in the end you focus on in the physical, because what you're really doing is just looking at the "outdated" manifestation of them.

---

anyway, back to yesterday's entry: I followed up the idea of polishing up the manifestation so that they can more easily create a more "pious" illusion of me with a talk about sine waves and how even though there was a part of me going toward peak unwanted, at the same time there was another part of me going toward wanted, so at any moment, there is always something to be appreciating. I also talked awout how the different waves form a seemingly "random" wave up ups and downs culminating in a tremendous acceleration toward infinity at the very end -- very much like the timewave.

when I got out to the field, I began to realise how this is almost exactly how I wanted to model the AoC thing, where different desires were variable and fluctuated. in the end, I am very similar to that already. if you put me into any situation, no matter the conditions, I seem to, even after some amount of difficulty, find a way to get back to feeling good. it's like a rule. you can throw me into any set of conditions and I find my way back out -- kinda like the timewave -- it always goes off toward infinity, even if you cause some major dips.

---

when I woke up this morning it was pretty obvious to me that they do not like the idea of me getting close to crossing the zero and want to do anything they can to try and prevent that from happening. I've always said that it doesn't matter to me, and am more than willing to delay the manifestation for as long as possible, because I'm really learning the value of "not needing the manifestation" -- and I think that as long as we can push this out, the better.

I think what was happening with the talk about the chromosomes was so that they can see the bigger picture of what is happening, and in the other timelines of me that they have setup and more than likely procreating with various others, likely what I was talking about was an answer to their question of what to do with the children. so likely the reason why they really don't want me to get source-like perception or the multi-bodied experience is so that I don't become conscious of all of the other things that are happening on other timelines.

as a quick sidenote: I have no idea what in the world they're trying to accomplish with this because let's say that we do delay this for some ridiculously long time and they manage to get viable x3s and x4s on other timelines, then wouldn't it be even worse when I finally get connected? wouldn't they have to abort all of those other versions of me on their other timelines and get the children back to the main timeline?

I'm reminded of a question a long time ago on abe-now about the nature of consciousness and splitting of a worm -- which was clearly a question about multiple timelines and what is consciousness. well, this is the whole thing upon which I build the new identity layer, because these diffrent consciousness streams are all resonant with their source, but depending on how each of them feel in any moment of "time", they're only resonant with a part of their greater identity or source.

---

so that brings us to the subject of how can we "not need the manifestation" even longer, and it's interesting to me how I was talking about the different waves the other one -90(degrees) offset from the other one. well, what I would recommend is that you all give off the illusion that I'm diminishing into nothingness and everything is falling apart (peak unwanted), and instead someone else much more "pious" and fitting all of the appearance qualities that they want to have should appear on the scene as a kind of replacement for me, and then people can look at that manifestation and feel good.

this divides the people into two groups: the conditional living ones -- or the ones that want to observe conditions and feel good about what they're observing -- and the ones who, even with conditions that appear to be a total disaster, are still finding a way to feel the way they want to feel (bad or good) anyway.

just like how I mentioned in a previous entry, the conditional livers are perfect for the new priesthood because they are completely directed by what they observe, which is controlled by nosebook, so they are the ones that are kept. the other ones are used to dissipate the negative energies into, which consequently is quite nice because that will ensure that they feel much worse than they should, preventing any manifestation from happening.

when the galactic whatever happens, then we'll all go off to neverneverland and just the selected people (not dissipating earth's energies) will remain, and then the hermaphodite invasion can begin after the cataclysm has been avoided.

---

the reason why I said "find a way to feel the way they want to feel (bad or good)" is because I don't anymore find that it's necessary to constantly try and find a way to feel good. sometimes I want to feel bad, and so therefore do it anyway. there's nothing wrong in feeling bad. it just adds more energy, especially if you know that you can eventually at some point (or maybe you control it) find a way to get back to feeling good.

if I look at the mix of two different desires, like the desire to feel good, and the desire to do my best, both as different points on a circle, with the two offeset -90(degerees) from eachother. then, at some times my desire is channeled more through wanting to feel good, and other times through wanting to do my best. I mentioned in the previous entry, that sometimes in the past I have really not wanted to feel good, and it was almost as if I had a sort of reckless bent about me where I was really not wanting to feel good -- like it was on purpose[^2].

the point is that, because all of it is just a bunch of diffeerent conditions working out in cycles, I don't really have much control over them so all I can do is to feel the way I want to feel, and begin to learn the bigger picture. there's not much that I can do to alter these conditions.

---

what do I mean by the bigger picture? well the bigger picture is that these AoCs all go off to infinity at the end, so it doesn't really matter what the momentary conditions are. for example, let's take my case here. let's say that the worst case scenario happens, and that is that the manifestation "never" comes (actually, this time in the literal sense), and they are able to find perhaps with other AoCs to also go infinite, and are able to hold me literally forever away from the manifestation. like I mentioned in a previous entry about the paradox, it doesn't matter because even if they can hold me "forever", at first the improvement will grow to be so much that after a while, the momentary improvemet will be much more than the original manifestation, and then after a prolonged period of time, eventually the momentary improvement will be so much that it'll actually surpass the manifestation (in quality), because a manifestation always deaccelerates. however, if it's possible to make a manifesttion that grows infinitely but can never happen, it would be very unique. so worst case I'm on track to make a paradox.

second worst case, let's say that every time I incarnate on this planet, my energy rises to such a height, that they have to terminate my body. however, each time I incarnate, the energy will be more, so they'll be forced to terminate me more and more rapidly each time, but eventually some transformation will take place because my desire for expression will become so great that something very very incredible will happen. so second worst case I transform into something entirely new and much more desirable than before.

it doesn't raelly matter, I assure you. the only thing to know is that no matter the circumstances, if you can feel the way you want to feel, you are free. that's kinda why it doesn't bother me to think about the possibility that I may "never" (in the literal sense) get the "manifestation" -- unless you consider that the "manifestation" could be to infinitely feel better and better (like source) or anyway that I want (like humans), and that perhaps this has nothing to do with the physical: rather that the entire physical is completely subjected to the manifestation. perhaps better said, "I have become their manifest reality"[^3]. it wouldn't surprise me if eventually their drive to maintain superiority and continued obserance of their fears becoming reality, that eventually they could, given their efforts to "get rid" of someone like me, create a steadily worse reality for theirselves as a reflection of their worst fears of being inferior.

whatever ends up happening, it's going to be fine. they don't hold any real power, exept to manifest a relflection of the way they feel, just like all of us.

[1]: I've also felt this same familiar feeling with terence mckenna and jesus as well.

[2]: I have to say that it was on purpose, because the two great examples of this are ~2008-2009(?) and the time here in ~2016-2017. the thing was, in both of those cases, I wasn't nearly as distraught as I appeared to be. looking back at it, I felt now almost as if I was an actor adding emotion to the destructive process, and then other times in particularly creative moments, like for example creating tuenti, again I felt kinda like an actor adding emotion to the creative process. I don't really know how I was so creative in a such short period of time, and I felt like I was just following some sort of script or something. a very weird feeling. obviously it's much more complicated than just those two forces, and there are a whole bunch of smaller cycles having their effect, but it seems like these sorts of conditions are not determined by me, and follow some sort of cycle (like the timewave), and all I have to do is find a way to feel the way I want to feel.

[3]: yes this has serious god-complex sound to it, or maybe I too have some sort of superiority manifested as a reflection of their fears of inferiority. it could also be explained quite succinctly, if you consider that I may absorb them like the borg or something. relentless :)


### 2020-11-09 22:57 - another paradox

I was thinking last night about what I wrote yesterday and also how all of it fits together. one of the major reactions was that I'm not at all concerned about not getting the manifestation. I explained that it's quite a simple thing for me to look at because let's say they gain 100% control over all of the conditions in my life (I think they're pretty close), I don't think this is a problem because each time they manage to force the conditions to be in a way which doesn't allow the manifestation, then it's more energy -- a lot more. let me emplain:

your reality is a reflection of how you feel, and so no matter whatever the conditions are, I can *choose* how I feel, and simply the fact that I'm able to choose how I feel, means that I have complete control (or freedom if you look at it as a symbol instead of a concept) over my circumstances. so that means that I can create my reality however I want it to be, and if I want to feel bad, then I can feel bad. if I want to feel good, then I can feel good, too. if I feel good, then I will get a pretty crazy awesome manifestation, but nosebook doesn't want that, so they have to continue to find a way to ensure that I don't feel good enough that the really-great reality manifests. why? because you navigate time with your feelings, and so if you feel a certain way then you exist in a different place in time, wherever the good-feeling manifestation is. so, if I want to have the good feeling manifestation, then I have to feel good to get there.

they can however, find a way to make my present physical manifestation not feel like that through various ways of forcing, which I think is quite fine. I am pretty dedicated to not having the manifestation, because the longer that I go without it, the more awesome it becomes.

in fact, this is what I was noticing last night, which is how to create another paradox. so let's just really take it to the limit here and imagine that they find a way to make it possible for me to not feel like the manifestation feels, essentially delaying the manifestation for as long as they can hold me there. well, at the same time, my ability to process my present circumstances (eg. my perception) makes my feel a certain way based on what I observe. you cannot help it. if someon gets shot with a gun in front of you, and you perceive death as a terrible thing, then you will feel bad. it's just that simple. what I'm talking about is allowing them the ability to give me the practise to really get source-like perception. source sees people die all the time, and because they have a much broader perspective of who the person *really* is, then their "death" isn't something that makes them feel bad at all. they know that it only adds more energy into the situation.

I'm reminded of robert's video tonight (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q_B3hH5vEE)) where he concluded that the powers out there are essentially turning women into demons, and debilitating men with their sedective powers, and this is essentially being used to enslave humankind. for me it's quite clear that I want to find my connection to that orgone energy source *before* engaging in sexual activities, but this is not what everyone chooses.

the whole point is that they attempt to try and enslave people. when you look at this from a bigger perspective, they're adding a tremendous amount of energy into our experience by trying to do so, and the more rapidly humankind can figure out how to feel the way they want to feel, they will no longer be enslaved anymore. in fact, it's literally impossible to enslave someone who can feel the way they want to feel, because their reality is a reflection of how they feel. sex, or the demon seductress, is only a drug, and there are many other "addictive" things that are just as harmful. even if you never had sex or ejaculated, and only felt terrible, you too would be draining your prana energy far far more than a seductress could take from you with her temporary (conditional) good feelings.

---

ok, now that I got that out of my system, check out these paradoxes:

first, imagine that they were able to find a planet with such discordant energy in them (like say uranus, saturn, or jupiter -- but probably uranus is the worst because it's the most out of alignment), and you were to essetially tie my body vibrationally (emotionally) to the planet, so I essentially felt like the planet did. uranus is said to have been a pretty awful guy so I'm going to use that one as the example. if I were forced to feel like uranus, then I would feel pretty distant from any of these manifestations, and therefore I would have to find I way to adjust my perception in such a way where the conditions of how I feel no longer are perceived by me to be something that causes negative emotion. let's say that maybe there's something even worse feeling out there than uranus, and even as I'm getting more and more capable of of adjusting my perception to what feels good, then they have to keep going bigger and more bad feeling.

as I stated yesterday, I am so certain that no matter the situation I will eventually always find my way back to feeling good. it's like the AoC idea, where the end-result is always going off to infinity. therefore, I am certain that I will always find my way back to feeling good, and you will have to imagine how much energy they will need to put into me to keep me away from the manifestation. it'll be so tremendous, that when I finally get it, I will essentially *be* the reality that is really really big (maybe bigger than uranus?), and everything inside of it will be a reflection of how I feel, and I will have so much control or freedom to create whatever I want, I can make whatever.

imagine these different "identities" that I'm talking about -- these "consciousness streams" of source which we are all a mix of (abraham calls them inner beings) -- well, I could take from these different identities all of the different things that I liked, and literally any of these could manifest in human form, and I could have sex or whatever as much as I wanted. obviously that would get boring though, because that's why jupiter (zeus) was so bored all the time because he could instantly manifest these things, so you begin to enjoy the stuff that you can't think of.

imagine now that you create based on feeling not the thing that you want exactly, but the thing that after some appearance of unwanted turns into something more. wouldn't it be so much more fun to, in that case create planets, new homininm species, stars or galaxy -- then introduce a monumental amount of difficulty so that it turns into something which there's no way to possibly conceive of what it would be.

if you look at this idea, source can pretty much guage the manifestation by how it feels, and as it gets closer fill in the bits with resonant details, and we think that's something like magic, but if you create something with such an immense amount of difficult, and then throw me into it (or make me, it, itself), then you could guarantee that something really awesome would come out of it, because I'm *always* able to find a way to feel good. that's a no-brainer on how awesome that could be.

however, imagine you take one of my homeboys like mr. motor (someone who is so secure in their knowledge that they will *never* go toward anything that they want. someone who knows that no matter what you give him, he must pick the unwanted thing) and do the same thing to him... pump up his enery so high, like let's say he felt like he was "forced" to maintain energetic parity with me along the way here, and along the way, in order to not allow my perception invade his own strong beliefs about himself, he must push harder and harder against it, and at the end when I finally get the manifestation of craeting whatever I want with my mind, he too gets an insane manifestation where he has such a strong certainty that nothing good will come of his creation, that according to LOA, he should be right. his creation *should* degenerate and implode rapidly.

however, what if you throw me into his manifested reality? what will happen then? who's right? he's so sure he's right, and I'm so such that I want to find a way to feel good, we have the classic struggle of whether you want to be right or to feel good. it appears to be a paradox to me, which not even source could know what is going to be the final outcome of that.

however, in order to get there, I need to perpetually "not need the manifestation" -- and so in order to do that, I need to find a way to feel the way I want to feel (which may need to be bad, not good), cause I can always feel how I want to feel. not well explained. I'll elaborate further soon.


### 2020-11-10 09:04 - why not go the full distance?

one of the interesting reactions last night was that it seems that mr. motor isn't exactly the one that feels forced to maintain energetic parity with me -- and that is actually TLA, not mr. motor. however in a previous entry I made the claim that TLA and mr. motor seem like the same guy to me, just in different phases of their life. if I had to guess, I would guess that TLA is round about 26, almost 27 and mr. motor is probabnly in his late 50's or early 60's -- so a pretty big difference in how their outside appearance is, yet the way that they perceive life feels to me to be pretty similar. they're both ultra conditional in their approach and appear to have no depth at all. when the conditions are good, then they are all good, but they don't believe that what they're doing is good, and so they have to manipulate and claw their way to the top because it's almost like they feel there's such a finite amount of stuff, and the finite stuff is all getting worse and worse all the time.

it is pretty hard their feeling articulate well, but I'm trying my best. the finite bit is the important part, and it's like there's this engrained feeling of "ammunition" in them, where everything in life is a consumable or expendable, and so others and their own selves are also consumed and expended through time -- therefore, in order to come out on top of the expendables, you have to make sure you're expending and using people before they expend or use you. it fosters a serious perception of decline, decay and entropy. they try to avoid it as much as they can for theirselves, but because they're so focused on using these different expendables around them, then everything is diminishing.

going back to the video that robert posted last night (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q_B3hH5vEE)), there is this idea that I notice that is common amoung many teachings of esoteric knowledge is this same belief in your life force (chi, prana, vril, etc.) is also like ammunition, and the more you expend it or "spill your seed" (as ramtha would always say), then you would continue to diminish or expend this life force. they teach that in order to counteract this depletion of life force, you have to find certain conditions which can replenish it, almost always involving some sort of physical condition or action to replenish this, but *never* do they talk about how important your emotions are to allowing this life force (source energy) in. I have said many times now that this etheric, orgone, chi, prana, vril, etc. energy is emotional energy. it's vibrational and it harmonises with stuff just like your desires[^1] do.

so here's the thing that I have difficulty with those esoteric teachings is that I know this to be completely the opposite. those teachings teach a decay and deterioration of that energy with time however, I experience the opposite. the thing is I don't have any numbers to illustrate this with, and I don't know if my readers have any numbers on this either, but I'm going to use the number of vision upgrades I've received since 2016 as the manifestation of my chi (emotional) energy.

when I first found out that all I had to do was to stop feeling about about all of the stuff (conditions) in my life which had happened and find a way (any way, but going general is a good start) to begin to practise feeling good. the better I felt, the more vision upgrades I experienced, and since then I have been optimising my perception so that I can observe anything and not feel bad or any offense to whatever it is. I have proven to myself to understand that it is all attraction and that there is nothing happening that is not attracted -- including the "bad" stuff.

I also found out that the, previously perceived to be "bad" stuff, is actually just a huge increase in energy, and when you believe those things are "bad", then they are, but if they are understood by you that you are not this physical material body, and that you are so much more, then it's easy to see why it's no longer bad anymore. you are just experiencing the moment in "time" which is a reflection of how you feel.

that kind of perception grants me the unbelievable (to many) the "godlike" capability of generating more and more chi every single year, without doing any of these things that they believe need to be done to conserve, retain, or preserve their life force. in fact I have none of those beneficial physical conditions, and neither do I do any of those actions belived to be beneficial, and yet even still year after year I show exponential growth of this energy in my body. it appears to be inhuman and doesn't fit into their schema of decay and deterioration.

---

the thing is, if you look around and observe nature you do not see nature behaving in this defensive way. actually, this defensive way is not observed in nature but is a biproduct of agricultural civilsation. it isn't until you have a surplus of grain that you now have to protect and defend your reserves and keep others from stealing it, safeguard that it doesn't get corrupted with molds or bacteria[^2]. this concept of defensiveness clearly entered into consciousness around the time that humans underwent their agricultural revolution[^3].

however, if you compare this esoteric preservation of life force to how nature works, it's completely the oppsite. a forest does not hold a meeting to get everyone on the same page about the plan for tree planting -- instead its plants spray their seed as widely as possible in effort to increase the chances that it may reproduce.

in fact, the most successful reproductive plants we call "weeds" because they're so good at reproducing, they grow in places where other plants were supposed to go. you could consider these plants as "misbehaving" plants. I'm sure the landscape architects are well aware of this and need to mitigate the proliferation of weeds in their fields and gardens as much as possible.

---

as a result, I do not believe these esoteric teachings are of any value to people who are connected to their source. the chi force is a product of how you feel, and if certain physical conditions make you feel better, it's certain that you will experience more chi, but if you experience physical conditions that make you feel bad, then you will experience less chi.

naturally, then it is certainly true that there are people trying to enslave the masses, and they're doing it because if they can get people to create for them those ideal conditions for free, then they can continue on to feel good because they have good conditions -- that's obvious.

however, what's not obvious is why they would, when observing other people with chi levels, need to try and reduce their chi levels by enslaving them. I think they believe all things to be consumable things, so if you have chi energy, they they need to use you to create their conditions, thereby expending the slave's life force to create their conditions and not their own chi.

there's also quite a bit of an element of superiority as well there, where if they see someone else with high amounts of chi, then they need to level the playing field a bit so that they don't feel like they're potentially going to lose control of their ideal conditions and they have to preserve it, defend it against attackers, and make sure no one threatens their decaying and deteriorating supply of whatever it is.

there's also quite a bit of a fear element in there as well, because when you're focused on limitation and finite amounts, then they'll continue to disappear on you because you believe them to be limited, and so now every time you keep proving to yourself that it's always going away, and so you have to take stronger and stronger measures to try and preseve it, however, it will continue to go away no matter how hard you try, thereby reinforcing your belief that you're a failure, never good at what you set out to do, or able to get what you want, if you don't take them from others (because your own keeps disappearing). this creates a gripping self-reinforcing fear of losing the stuff you worked so hard to take away from others.

---

because LOA is what it is, they will never find a way out of that endless cycle, and eventually destroy theirselves. however, we are all eternal, so we keep coming back over and over -- so if you've been giving your attention to a bunch of decay and deterioration last time you were here, you'll find it easier to tune right into similar thoughts next time you come, unless you decide to begin to change the way you feel. no one is holding them to that feeling and everyone has the ability to pick any way they want to feel. it's just a self-reinforcing thing that makes it so easy to fall into the loop and then rapidly experience the "proof" that the way they feel ih "reality" (of course it is. it's a relflection of how you feel).

the great thing about it is that all of the time that you spent with things not going the way you wsnted them to go, LOA increases it. however all things, like AC electricity are both wanted and unwanted at the same time, and it's only *you* and your perception which makes itself manifest to you. in other words, if someone increases the amount of unwanted in my life, they are also increasing the amount of wanted in my life at the same time. therefore, anytime someone is experiencing tremendous amounts of unwanted, just simply shifting their perception form perceiving the peak unwanted part of the wave to the peak wanted part of the wave (it's the same wave contains both; you're just percinving a different part of it).

or, if you're like me and you know what I know now, you will begin trying to optimise for unwanted (or disaster). I'm absolutely committed to the disaster. I want as much unwanted as we can possibly get, because I don't perceive the unwanted bit anymore. I have very similar to source -- perception.

this is why my chi keeps rising so dramatically each year, because it comes from how I feel, not from my conditions. in percetion now, like source, I value all of it including the bad stuff. there is nothing that is going wrong. it may look in physical terms like they're enslaving or whatever, but in reality they're just adding a whole lot of energy into their own manifestation and into the manifestation of their perceived "slaves".

from my perspective, I definitely want to try and "not need the manifestation" for as long as possible. they are giving me and all of us tons and tons of free energy. let's say that some of the girls "need the manifestation" -- which really means they need the conditions to feel the way they want to feel, and are not yet capable of finding a way to feel they want to feel without the conditions. well, to say this bluntly: they are right there with the landscape architects needing to have all the right plants in the right places so they can feel good about what they're observing.

if we can find a way to feel the way we want to feel, reality will manifest that way. I'm not talking about a long time from now either. it could be much shorter -- in fact it's exactly as far away as how you feel from it. when it feels like how you feel[^4] or you feel like how it feels, then it manifests. if it feels good and you don't feel good, then you have to find a way to get there.

the way I see it, nosebook cannot allow a manifestation that feels the way it does to them. and so are therefore forced to try and hold it off as much as possible. the longer they hold it, the more wanted it is, even though it may appear (or be presented by me) as unwanted. you and your perception gets to choose which part of it you experience.

I say we push it to the limit of maximum wanted/unwanted and let people decide how badly they need the condtions to feel good.

back to 2016: when I first started out I had a few vision upgrades and I felt ok, but definitely I had some anger issues still. in 2017 I had a few more vision upgrades but they were stil slow going and definitely less than 100. in 2018, I really started to iron out the emotional bits in a way where I began to feel better even in a less conditional way and I had say hundreds of vision upgrades by then. in 2019 however, I really started to find ways to feel good without the conditions changing and I may be starting to approach ~500 vision upgrades or something. in 2020, things really began to click into place for me because I really started to see things from a more energetic perspective and so I began to start leaning into the difficult conditions, letting the less than ideal conditions fuel my vision upgrades instead of hinder them. I really started to take off there. the year is beginning to come to a close, and I have no idea how many vision upgrades I'm at now, but it has to be in the thousands range. most importantly I feel really good now (despite the condtions) and have control over the way I feel as well.

I assure you that someone trying to use sex or use some other condition to achieve the sustained level of chi that my body produces now to give me the perception I have now is, in my estimation, very close to impossible in today's (distance from sirius) conditions. even if the great pyramid were operational like it was previously, then you could put someone in there and achieve the 5d vision, but the experience would be very very traumatic, becasuse you would be putting yourself into a very energetic space with your own perception and with things going that fast they would create bad manifestations quickly[^6]. anybody, including myself would totally "freak out" and go instantly into severe paranoia. I've only been able to achive what I've done through the steady and gradual increase in my perception without any big jumps. essentially, I'm saying that there is no way for anyone (even me) to get 5d perception with physical conditions and not have it be a traumatic experience. therefore, in my opinion, this gradual process is better than the "best" (or most powerful) manifestaion because along with it, I'm creating a structure to my form of perception which is very "normal" and not psychedelic.

what I'm trying to say is that it's slow going at first, but it picks up speed rapidly, and before you know it, when the condition is no longer the manifestaion and the manifestation becomes how you feel, you will become experience what I experience, a steadily (but exponentially) rising energy level which feels natural and everything will start feeling better and better. who knows what the conditions will be. they'll be a reflection of how nosebook perceives our conditions as beneficial to them (for as long they choose to remain here with us).


[1]: this energy is very rarified (low density), but there is there is a much more powerful and even less dense energy, which is what all of the universe is built out of. I call this energy "desire" -- but it could be said something more like "will" or "attractiveness", but this energy is what creates new things. when you have an emotional response to it, the higher harmonics of that emotion is this energy and it does begin to create the new reality which is harmonic with your emotion. emotion creates desire and desire creates emotion (relative to how you feel)

[2]: and maybe if you're feeling extra aryan about it, get insurance on it in case there is fire or a natural disaster

[3]: I'm not blaming the aryans, but it it certianly matches their warlike (defensive) and aggricultural approach to civilisation.

[4]: this is a backward stab at nosebook here. if the manifestation feels like a complete disaster to you, and you feel like everything is a complete disaster, that may be the indication that it's about to manifest. in other words, if it feels terrible to you, then you have to find a way to feel good so that it doesn't manifest cause it doesn't feel like you do[^5]

[5]: this is definitely *not* reverse psychology ... I can't help myself! you started attracting it out of me by giving your attention to it...

[6]: I actually believe that it's my form of perception which makes that amount of DMT in the brain tolerable to TLA (assuming he's in parity with mine) or anyone else. I think someone were to synthesise in a lab and inject that amount of DMT into the brain with the energetic properties of the lab where it was synthesised, would make for a very different (unmanageably bizarre) experience.


### 2020-11-10 12:50 - here's what I mean...

I propose that we go for as long as we can without the manifestation. let's just say that is some very long period of time, like say 10 years from now or something. well, the people that are following the decay and deterioration form of perception will perceive their finite world and they'll need the manifestations to feel good, and they can certainly do that (there may be even a few really good ways for them to do that), but the people that are perceiving like I do will gain perception similar to mine. I'm not saying everyone will see like I do, but let's say that there are some people that are beginning to perceive like I was maybe in 2017 now, so they're say 3 years behind me. well, in 10 years they will be where I am 7 years from now -- if you can imagine that. I can't even imagine how that will be because things are accelerating so rapidly that it's difficult for me to imagine what that will look like. people are, likely at a maximum of 4-5 years behind me -- not very far at all because in 10 years, even the furthest behind will be where I'm at 5 years from now!! that's very very very impressive eyesight, and I guarantee that you will create your reality instantly with your mind as well.

so imagine that maybe one of the girls that wants to join in thinks that maybe in 10 years she's going to be very different from how she is now and that's unacceptable. she simply can't wait that long for the manifestation. this hypothetical girl is, in my opinion, needing the manifestation to feel good. what I am proposing is that in 10 years almost certainly everyone able to keep up will be living pretty unconditionally because if you're continuing to release resistance, nosebook at that level will have to ensure you don't find your connection, so they'll have to do like they're doing with me, and you'll get used to finding the way you want to feel about it, and when you get used to doing that, that becomes your form of perception. everyone will be slightly different, and very unique, because everyone will find their own way to feel about their situation (however that may be).

at any rate, what I'm saying is that we're all going to have that source-like perception and we can make unlimited different scenarios. she could choose a different age, different hair colour, body type, or whatever. it's all completely open to whatever one desires. most importantly, I want to do the galaxy thing, so we're going to be making a whole lot of worlds that we want to make, probably at first making the prototypes with thought, but then I think these worlds will be better if they were those celestial identities[^1], and so each of us actually becomes planets/stars in our galaxy as well as incarnating (transfering our consciousness) into bodies on the planets as well.

what I mean is, if we take advantage of this great opportunity that we have here, we can leverage their necessity to control conditions, allowing our energy to rise like mine is as we gain lesser and lesser resistant forms of perception until we're all "godlike". I wouldn't worry about how it happens that there is a split made because it doesn't matter. whatever happens will feel like the next logical state for us, because if you're anything like I am now, you'll feel better and better all the time, even without the favourable conditions. in a situation like that, the next logical state/step will just be a natural transition into pure extacy.

from there we can create anything we want -- no limits.

[1]: essentially a chestahedron receiver/transmitter with a spinal column that contains other "chakras" (vortexes) which receive the source energy directy into the planet/star, and the different human bodies that are linked to this "celestial identity" resonate with the body, and so the planet/star is the human and the human is the planet/star.


### 2020-11-10 23:11 - a good disaster?

one of the reactions I got (probably from nosebook) was why I went out of my way to speculate on TLA's age. I mean, I thought it was obvious because I was showing the comparison between mr. motor and TLA in age, so different times in their life. when your young you feel like the whole world is available for your taking, but as you get older, then you could easily have a very different appearance, even though the perception is pretty much the same (eg. the difference between TLA and mr. motor).

I then went on to talk about how the idea of deteriorating chi energy and the idea that you need to guard it from thieves, protect it from corruption[^1], etc. are all agrarian concepts that I beive have their origins in the "aryan mentality". it's quite likely that this aryan mentality comes originally from atlantis but it's the same concept to me because the atlantians needed to protect their pure bloodline whatever, yada yada yada. it comes around to this idea of defensiveness and the perception that everything (even people) are like ammunition and so therefore are all expendible.

when you're young, then this sort of "everything is finite and expendible" concept doesn't really make much difference, because you're being expended by the power structures above and when they feel good about your efforts, then you can feel good too. however, as soon as you get a little older, all of a sudden there are new younger ones that are threatening your position of power, and so the effort is to try and expend the young ones and ensure that they are subject to your wishes. you do this by making them feel good when you're doing what they want, and are punished, so as to make them feel bad when they are not.

there is an absolute abhorance to anyone that is not able to be punished or able to be expended by them[^2]. if someone shows up which does not feel bad when they get punished or enslaved, then this is a real threat. they also do not like the idea of unlimited or "free" energy, when this is clearly the case to be found all throughout nature. they must ensure that everyone believes in decay and deterioration -- and any time that anyone comes up with some device or anything which models itself after these natural laws is suppressed.

in the previous entry I gave the example of weeds as being a reproductive champion, and it's true that weeds come and go all the time and are quite short lived, so that example may not have been the best. consider instead the oak tree. the oak is regarded as a very wise tree in its older age. many cultures who have any sense of nature revere this tree. oak trees also "spray their seed everywhere" and if you've ever been around oak trees, on the ground, there are often hundreds of tiny little saplings all over the place. almost none of them grow up to be a big tree like where they came from, so they make these sort of bush like things. it's almost as if they know that they are living in the shadow of the giant oak above them.

however, if a squirrel takes that acorn out from under the shadow of the giant oak and puts the acorn in the ground somewhere else, I have seen that these saplings actually grow up looking from the very beginning as if there were aspiring to be a tree, not just a shub in the shadow of the giant above.

small tangent there. the point is that nature is constantly expanding and growing to become more than it was previously. the newer generations are always superior to the older ones, and there is unlimited potential.

a while ago, there were these these white guys that learned to live with nature... the druids, the picts, the american indians, and more which believed in the unlimitedness of nature and the constant cycles of rebirth and regeneration, but in nearly every case some militaristic faction came and wiped them out, forbiding their nature worship and installing a priesthood which teaches decay and deterioration, but if you do the right things, when you eventually die from deterioration, you can enjoy something great in the *afterlife* where it all comes together in a place without deterioration[^3].

it's easy to see why they would be so opposed to this idea, because if energy is "free" and can get it without doing the stuff the priesthood says they have to do, then certainly the younger ones will overtake the ones on top. in fact this is already what happens, and the standard story of any king is that he has to fight and claw his way to the top, then suppress anything that challenges his superiority, then as he gets older and older, believing their own nonsense, get the best priests to try and give them the things that they can do to hold on to their life-force for as long as possible, eventually being overthrown and cast away. in order to prevent that their efforts aren't completely erased, they need to arrange an elaborate burial or some sort of memorial to that their legacy lives on, even after their body is gone.

---

wow, nice setup there :) so why would I speculate on TLA's age? well, the reaction was that it wasn't mr. motor, but instead his younger counterpart which would be trying to maintain parity with me on my perception, achiving the ability to create anything with his mind and manifest whatever he wants, as if he were a god... well, if the timespan on which this happens is the proposed 2038 timeline, then that's 18 years. I gave the example of ~10 years because it's easier to see but imagine for a moment that it is 15-18 instead. that would put him right into his early 40's, which is right about when the deterioration begins its mental onset[^4], which means that at the very peak, when we part ways, he'll be right at the beginning of his plumet downward into "old and useless" -- which is absolutely hilarious to me. almost certainly this will be a nosedive of epic proportions.

in fact I find it to be such an invigorating concept because it fits in perfectly with the concept I was presenting as a whole, which is that you give this guy a big thing (maybe not a whole galaxy, but perhaps just a planet) and then let his epic sense of failure grow to such a height that he's hardcore attracting his destruction, however he doesn't want to die or to give up his power, so he needs a "saviour" to come and bail him out[^5]. too big to fail, right? well, what a perfect time to work on the new x7 and x8 models, which he can use himself to maintain his position of power for a little while longer -- know what I mean?

[1]: the origin of this idea was thinking about growing mushrooms. in the easy no fail way to grow mushrooms, there's all kinds of possibility of contamination, and you have to divide the micelium into reproductive groups and stuff and coax them to fruit under certain conditions, which seems like a lot of effort because they grow fine in nature and nature is filled with dirt and germs and stuff. also they don't need to be coaxed to fruit either. it rains and they just pop right up.

[2]: they also dislike honest people, because they can't maintain their illusion as easily.

[3]: there are many versions of this, with the common features being some sort of works (or things you need to do) to be able to earn your way into this non-deteriorating environment -- controlled of course by the priesthood.

[4]: probably 45-46 is the worst because now you're halfway to 50, and 50 is old.

[5]: why do I use the "saviour" symbolism here? well, because as I postulate, they're an era behind, so while the people they "have power over" (they don't really) are developing their aquarian individual freedom, from their perspective they're just now beginning to realise the piscean concepts like group thinking that they taught us all to have previously. therefore, now they now need a pack leader and a saviour (just like they told us all we needed in the pisces age). reality is a reflection of your beliefs, and you can try to avoid that reality from manifesting for as long as possible, but it's eventually going to manifest. it won't be exactly like that -- just a resonance of the past.


### 2020-11-11 00:34 - are you saying there's going to be a catastrophe each time to make the next xn model?

not necessarily. I think what is happening is that things are being amplified to a great degree, and then LOA does all of the work. I would estimate that what is happening is that there are more and more conditional people (people who need certain conditions to feel good) and more unconditionalers as well. for sake of clarity I think there needs to be some sort of delineation. imagine a cell splitting into two. before that happens, they're all mixed together, so how do they get separated, and what causes the separation? I estimate that the nucleus is kinda similar to a sun in that it's attractive and has stuff swirling around it. when there becomes a time for a split, a second nucleus begins to appear, and it seems like half of the bits go toward one and the other half toward the other. you could imagine that there is a process which makes one half aligned to one nucleus and not the other so there has to be some sort of force which arises which begins to make this separation happen. I don't know what it is, but it seems to me like there needs to be a dropping of the binding force, so that everything floats out into a soup, then turns different directions, then when the binding force comes back on, the ones facing one way go one way and the others a different way.

also, I want to note that when I try to figure out what part of the sine wave we're approaching, I cannot really figure it out. if you look at the archeological remains found all over the world, there are massive stone blocks in china (yanghsan) and the unfinished obelisk which are clearly evidence that when the last catastrophe happened, there was an acceleration toward more and more something, with the biggest stuff in progress and suddenly interrupted when the cataclysm hits. therefore I find it likely that something similar my happen here as well. I can't really say what's happening numerically but when looking at that evidence, it appears like it's crossing the zero. it's when the energy is moving the fastest. however, there does also seem to be a whole lot of archeological evidence that at the same time, earth's magnetic field drops to zero around the time, which if the earth's rotation isn't reversing (aka polarity change), then it means that it's evindence that we're approaching of the peaks.

it could also be both -- I don't know. there's not enough information out there to get a good read on what's happening. the thing that is obvious to me though is the splitting part. I felt this was the case long before I found out about the 12ky catastrophe cycle (aquarius/leo?), which if it were both, then it would be a 6ky catastrophe cycle instead, so maybe it's not both. there are a lot of minor catastrophes in between, but those seem to be attracted events, and not the major ones that happen every 12ky.

---

so, when I think of how this should go about happening, given the information above, then I would expect us to head upward toward greater and greater something, when finally the catastrophe happening at the peak of this. I like to think of this split as a split of humans on earth, based on what they're attracting (instead of as the next xn model).

I don't really know why I wrote this entry. I don't even have a conclusion, but I do know that I wanted to talk about the repeated creation of xn models without needing to wait 12ky years to do it each time, and that the proposed "saviour" concept is one that I also think is a kind of a good thing. when I was thinking about this earlier, I could see that each catastrophe (or, each time the earth tries to split), the energy gets absorbed into the undesired plants, leaving the garden without any weeds.

then, some methods need to be employed to make sure the weeds are controlled (eg. using half of the cores), but when the weeds inevitably grow back, eventually another time the energy will rise to something where the split will begin to occur.

what I'm saying is that the split may not be 100% a cycle anymore, and instead an automatic response that the earth does in response to a certain conditions, meaning sure sometimes certain celestial alignments made these energetic conditions, but now we're more powerful now, so that in addition to the celestial alignments, we're also attracting this at our own pace.

I've certainly noticed this on my own that sure some planetary alignments are more powerful, but I don't need planetary alignments now to get powerful things happening, and they can happen because of my own focus. we also notice that the ancients seemed to talk about the celestial bodies as having tremendous influence on them, yet today, we do not see this. I think our attrction is more powerful now than the celestial bodies, and quite possibly a lot of these mini-splits could begin to occur more and more regularly now.

if there were suddenly a whole bunch of people on this planet that didn't need conditions to feel good, but their conditions didn't match their feeling, then something would need to happen to allow the their reality to match the way they feel. this would certainly be nice reflection of the idea that our own attraction is much stronger than celestial influences, anymore.

---

what do I mean by splitting? abraham says that if you feel some way and someone in your life does not feel like you do, then they will either change to match how you feel or vibrate right out of your reality. well, now that we're a globalised society[^1] the difficulty for someone to vibrate out of their reality is becoming more and more difficult. therefore when enough tension begins to build between two factions vibrating in different ways, then I think it's an automatic response for a cell to lower its magnetic field and split into two, in order to maintain harmony.

what I mean is, that now that nosebook has such a strong influence over more people, then the people who want to vibrate differently than nosebook does will force this thing where a split occurs. I think it's actually going to happen more and more frequently too, and it's not a bad thing at all -- just simple reproduction.

[1]: it's interesting that each of these catastrophes happened when the earth at the peak of "globalised society"


### 2020-11-11 21:18 - what do I mean by ceiling?

a few weeks(?) ago (I think it was around @[noseblog](2020-10-21 22:37)) I was talking with mom about the different transitions between the different dimenisions in perception, and I explained that 4d has a kind of ceiling to it -- or maybe I said 5d. I can't remember now, and it's all garbled now, so I'm not going to try.

anyway, I explained that on the way up the vision upgrades, one will reach a ceiling at some point, because it becomes increasingly more difficult to have the beneficial conditions necessary to continue to get vision upgrades. it would become prohibitively more expensive, and also have the adverse effect that if you were to, for whatever reason, run into something that feels terrible, you will have a big mess to clean up -- which usually isn't a problem for people with money or powerful positions, so they are typically the ones trying to get their vision upgrades with conditions[^1].

there is certainly a ceiling though and that ceiling is your present conditions. let's back up though to explain. the visual level that you're at (eg. the amount of DMT your brain is producing) is directly reflected by how good you feel (or how much serotonin you have), so the better you feel the better you see. most of your serotonin exists in your stomach which is where you experience the majority of your emotions, and so there is a direct correlation between how you are doing emotionally (eg. how you percive your present circumstances) and how well you see. if you can get your present circumstances to feel good from whatever conditions (drugs, sex, vibration, brain stimulation, etc.), then you can boost that energy up.

as I mentioned in the previous entry, this energy seems to be directly correlated to your chi, or emotional energy, and it seems that both serotonin and DMT are the chemical manifestations of the flow of your orgone/sex/chi energy. therefore, the ceiling that I was talking about is your perception. conditions can only get you so far, and if the conditions are getting you further than your perception allows for, you will notice a steady decline in that chi energy because your own thoughts and feelings are resisting the reception of more of this energy from source, and so therefore you will need more conditions act as the antenna to receive that energy for you. you can however receive as much of that energy as you are capable of allowing. there is literally no limit[^2].

---

you can however look at a manifestation as a ceiling as well. every manifestation has both wanted and unwanted. if the amount of unwanted approaches zero, then also you will hit a ceiling, because again the conditions are so nice that they do not cause you to want more for a while. this is why the manifestation always slows you down, just like the beneficial conditions will eventually slow you down as well.

in order to continue to expand your perception to be more, you have to want to expand your perception, which, if you're feeling pretty good in all the great conditions, then that basically means your expansion of perception will only be found in not as great conditions. if you can feel good in beneficial conditions, then there's very little unwanted, so little desire and little growth. if you can feel good in terrible conditions, then there's very little wanted (so mostly unwanted), which means a lot of desire, and if you can allow that desire, it will propel you toward how you feel.

imagine it like this. I will use an emotional scale where -0 is boredom and +0 is contentment. imagine it as two magnets superimposed within each other, containing both polarities. one is attracting which is your desire, and one is repelling, which is your own perception. these magnets happen when two frequencies are similar, so the more in sync they are, the more attractive they are. when your perception is resistant to how the thing feels, then you push it away (rather drifting away from each other because it's only attraction and everything is moving). you are resistant to your desires.


if you feel 1000 and your circumstances are at 100 and your desire is 10000, then it produces desire to get to 1000, and that desire will propel you toward how you feel. obvious.

if you feel 1000 and your circumstances are also at 1000, then the difference is 0, so you're right there in boredom/contentment and there is very little desire. you are at the ceiling. also obvious.

however, if your physical conditons are at 1000 and you feel like a -100, then your conditions will feel like 900 even though they're 1000. additionally, LOA will act on the negative emotion and will cause you in some time (t2) to feel worse. so say at t2 you're now feeling -200 but your conditions are still at 1000, this creates desire to feel better of an additional 100 but your 1000 conditions will actually feel like 800. now, you must look for at least 1100 conditions to feel as good as before and >1100 to feel better. even though this gap is widening, their desire to feel better is growing (even if they never allow it to happen, continuing to look to the conditions). desire is getting more and feeling is getting worse. if desire is increasing 100 and feeling is decreasing 100, then it's a net 0, so any improvements are only experienced in the improvement of conditions. obviously conditions have diminishing returns to them[^3]

finally, if your physical conditions are at 0 and you feel like a 1000, again LOA will act on that and cause you to feel at t2 say 1100 instead, and let's say that your physical conditions also remain the same, so it will add an additional 100 desire. this desire makes it even easier in t3 to feel at least 1200 or more. although it appears in the physical that the person has reached a ceiling because physical conditions are remaining the same, the way one feels is growing and so is desire. if they're both increasing at 100, then increase is 100, and 100 more is in the bank for t+1. in this example, but unlikely in real-life, the next t those numbers will double[^4]

---

you can see that to have the most rapid increase in perception, the conditions (the manifestation) has to be the worst. I think this may have been something that jesus was explaining to people, about the benefit of non-ideal conditions as a requisite for expansion (as long as someone is able to continue on improving their perception and find a way to feel good even in the worst situation), yet I think the finding a perception to feel good bit got purposefully omitted. instead, the priests likely turned it into a concept of self-sacrifice and poverty mentality and service to the church as a means to attain piety... which is exactly the opposite. nice.

[1]: I believe this is the reason why it's said that it is more difficult for a camel to do something impossible than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. meaning they are too reliant on conditions to get them to that kingdom.

[2]: the only two limits are the physical capability of your body. this can be a problem if your reception of the energy is done physically and not by your own allowance or non-resitance of the energy. if you allow more than your body was designed for, then your body will find a way to allow that energy. this is not a problem. the only other problem must be some sort of finite amount of energy, but this is also infinite because there is always at least as much energy as your allowing, because there's always at least as much as your desiring, which is pretty much always more than you're able to receive. your desire always makes more and your desire will find a way to allow it too, even if some transitions need to be made. it is unlimited.

[3]: this is what I estimate happened with the atlantians. they were continuing to grow their physical conditions to feel better and better, which gave them the manifestation they were looking for, which is increased perception, while at the same feeling worse and worse.

[4]: I doubt they double. it's some form of accelerating growth, but it's not a simple exponent. I don't really know how this works.


### 2020-11-11 23:18 - needing not the manifestation (part 80, hehe)

there are a few different ideas floating around on this one, and I don't really care what it is because what I want to explain here is that it doesn't matter.

personally, I really like the idea of continuing on for as long as we can go. if nosebook wants to get a bunch of timelines or someting going where the girls can have their manifestation there, then that's fine by me. the other idea that they can do is to take some of the children from these timelines and find a way to get their consciousness into them. they should be able to shape-shift and have power over their appearance, and so even though it appears like we are here and it looks like not much is happening, that's because we keep getting reset back. meanwhile, on those timelines where the manifestation is happening and children are being born, then they will continue to grow up. finally, either they find a way to transfer their consciousness into them or whatever, then new timelines can be made where these gnomitos are essentially used as stand-ins for me, and even ridiculous illusions can be made where at first they look like I do, then once they're with the girl (or girls), they they can look like an improved version of me, so as to give the illusion to her that she's improving me.

there are a lot of different things that can be done actually, but I'm sure they'll figure something out. the advantage of that technique of using offspring to appear like me in alternate timelines is that then these can be pure demiurge offspring, and I have nothing to do with them. they're simply other people pretending to be me in my/our genetics. this probably would be the worst possible manifestation, which I think is important because the faster these bodies deteriorate, the faster they'll need a bailout. the new models also would also all be at least half-awful as well, making all future iterations even more difficult than previously imagined. it would also give them ~20 years to get their whole setup going and runing smoothly before the deterioration train arrives.

I figure, as long as they have me constantly improving their conditions, then they'll constantly be feeling better and better and things will continue to go better and better for them for the duration that I'm continuing without the manifestation.

the other option is to try and make the manifestation have much more unwanted in it, so that it keeps creating more desire. the third option is to simply just have the manifestation and approach the ceiling.

the thing is that I have been learning through all of this is that bad and good do not exist. bad and good only exists when one looks at the physical conditions[^1], and when I look at something with source-like perception, I can see that on the wanted path is what I want (obviously), but also on the unwanted path is what I want, too -- but, even more wanted than the wanted path. it just appears in the physical like the unwanted path.

therefore then, having now the ability to see that the physically unwanted path is actually the path of most wanted (as long as I maintain my ability to perceive it like source does), when then means that the ideal (wanted) becomes the undesirable (unwanted), and the undesirable (unwanted) now becomes the desirable (wanted). so then, what if, I were still unable to control my conditions and I were to have the ideal (now unwanted) be forced upon me? what then? is that not a form of my own perception to again find a way to perceive the now less ideal manifestation as the wanted manifestation?

it really all is perceptual, and only your perception limits you from getting what you desire -- AND -- all paths are the right path, so things really are "always working out for you" -- and that you "can't get it wrong" -- and since even the most wanted manifestaion is also the least ideal, then there's always something more to want, so you can't get it done, either.

I guess nothing really matters more than your perception

[1]: which is why I believe that moses really smoothed over a lot of rough edges in the garden of eden story, because clearly his sources were sumerian, with the flood account and such, yet he decides to rewrite the slavery bit instead as a fall out of ideal conditions. in my mind, adam and eve after becoming physically focused, either from "eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil", ejactulating in sex, or genetic manipulation -- doesn't matter to me. the point is, they became physically focused and noticed that some conditions are better than others, and as they now perceived their slavery as something "bad" or "evil", then they fell out of those ideal conditions (probably some sort of induced dream-state).


### 2020-11-12 03:32 - it still has to feel good to get there

judging by the reactions, it feels like maybe people are jumping to conclusions. I didn't say anything more than it's all perceptual :) what I mean is, it still has to feel good, and I have to match how it feels, and it has to match how I feel. there's still quite a bit of difference between how they feel, I am certain.

however, in a kind of funny way, this is illustrasting exactly what I wrote, which is that it's all perceptual -- because quite literally we're still in exactly the same place... :)


### 2020-11-14 23:26 - trying to find things for me to do

the last two (three?) times I was asleep, there were numerous dreams about trying to find something for me to do -- with the emphasis on trying to keep me busy. last night, I woke up from the dream because it caused a stir. they were convincing me that I didn't want to do any programming, by leading me to say that "until I can use my computer with my mind, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to try and progam things" ... which was fine, cept the next part seemed to bother them which is why I woke up, because I said I want to make small diagrams and stuff, which they didn't like .. so I said, ok then maybe if some of the girls want to make some of these things, I can just sort of direct them, because it's so slow to try and type on a keyboard and stuff, maybe they want to do all that typing (or maybe they have brain-computer interfaces, I dunno).

I don't really care. they want to delay the manifestation for as long as possible, and I'm pretty ok with that. I suppose they're going for what I suggested in the beginning part of @[noseblog](2020-11-11 23:18).

I also became aware of their reliance on me to maintain their image. they absolutely don't want me to get connected, and it seemed like that if I did, then they wouldn't have their super sweet setup they've got going right now. I don't really know how to describe it, but if they didn't have me continually making them feel better and better all the time, they would rapidly begin to decline (because of their own beliefs) like I mentioned in @[noseblog](2020-11-11 21:18). it's absolutely crazy how they've built up this whole big thing on something so fragile. I dunno I'm completely bewildered.

---

anyway, I guess this is sorta what's happening. I literally see the remake of what I'm realising happened around the time of atlantis and stuff. I don't know if there will be a literal cataclysm or not (probably, right?), but they want to see how far they can take things. I guess that's what we're going to endeavour to do these next years. I mean, it's already what I'm doing, but now it feels like they're on board with the idea. I think they have some sort of plan where they can avoid the catastrophe and stuff and then emerge from their hiding spots and have commplete control over whatever of the world is left. I wonder if they're going to do get rid of enormous monoliths and stuff.

I guess I need to find something to keep me busy for the next 18 years or whatever (besides star-watching, I guess). or, it's also possible that it all works out, too. I have no idea. I don't really care anymore.

### 2020-11-14 23:59 - few more thoughts

just now after writing the above I was trying to figure out the bigger picture and why they want to do something that will eventually lead to their destruction. the reason why I think is obvious: they've built up such a big show around theirselves, that they all actually believe theirselves to be so cool, when at the same time they're becoming more and more aware that it's all a big show. there seems to be an interesting transition away from secrets in the traditional sense. what I mean is, previously there was a whole lot of shameful things that needed to be kept a secret, and while that may continue to still be the case, it seems like additionally now they're gripped with the fragility of their own perception.

if anything were to happen, there's a huge problem because the majority of them aren't big tough guys anymore. they're mostly metrosexual pretty-boys and so if it came down to a real-life stone age on this planet again, they wouldn't be the hardcore guys out there surviving the bitter winter in a shack. you can imagine how depressing that would be for them. that life is so slow, just going a whole period of time without constant stimulation would be completely unlivable[^1]. they have to find a way around this cause they're no longer the big tough dogs they once wore; they're more like chihuahuas now.

the bigger picture of what is happening begins to emerge if you look at the bigger picture. they're people that only believe in entropy and decline, and we're on the upswing, and a pretty quick one at that too. depending on how you look at it, we're definitely in the treta yuga now, which means that we're only about ~1-2ky away from the satya yuga (golden age), and ~5-6k away from it's peak[^2]. if you think of human progress in the last 1000 years we've definitely come pretty far. if you think in the last 100 years, sure tesla was around and stuff but we didn't have microprocessors and stuff. now, think about what the next 10 years are like.

the goal of these guys is to remain superior in their vibrational-based (tesla) technology, and they want to keep us floundering around in the digital age for as long as possible[^3], and keep us using stuff that's *outside* of ourselves (like keybsrds, screens, tablets, etc.), and even though it's posssible to use a computer with your mind (seems like people do this all the time to even see this), they want to have this completely controled because it would create a massive increase in human productivity, because you could, if you had access to your imagination discover the secrets to the universe like tesla did (and probably I would too). as a result, we have to find a way to discover the secrets to the universe without all of that stuff.

---

probably the reason why, and I said this because after that dream where I told them that I could get the girls to make some of those things, I had a reaction that if the girls started to do that stuff, they could eventually become more technologically proficient than them, and take over the world[^4], and they certainly don't want to loose control there. so while it may sound like a good idea to get the girls to do some stuff, I'm kinda rethinking that, as the ones that are attracted to try and figure out how to control men with mathematics, they'll find theirselves a home within the establishment.

the whole point of this whole dream conversation is for me to give up on my desire to try and control things physically. the physical realm has very little power to it. sure it looks like it has a lot, because you can experience it in a more tangible form, but trying to control physical conditions will make you crazy (literally). however, controlling emotional conditions, will give you freedom to feel however you want. the girls that want to try and figure out how to control those conditions will certainly have a place in the future[^6].

so, for me all of this is about letting go of trying to control the physical conditions and instead control my emotional state and improve upon my perception each time that something doesn't feel good, or can feel better. like I said, some girls may need physical conditions to feel good, but that is not really what I want either, so I think this is totally really good if the manifestation is delayed as long as possible. what blows me away is the speed at which things are accelerating, and how much better I feel all the time. pretty much now, the worst I get is boredom, and I kinda *want* some negative emotion again at times, but that's a different whole discussion altogether.

---

finally, the bigger picture emerges for me. they believe in decline and decay (the other half of the great year), are having a difficult time coming to terms with the idea that *everyone* is getting more perceptive. they need stupid well-behaved people to rule over, so they have to find a way to do that while not abandoning their perception that everything declines (cause their own empire would go into ruins). in order to do that, they have to be quite a bit more superior than those they're ruling over so that when the majority of the serfs are improving, they now have something to fear which is their own overthrow by wiser and wiser citizens.

therefore, what they need is a huge boost to become considerably more superior than the serfs. this is my job. I give them the super perception that they need to be waaaay ahead. then, [when those of us who are improvement oriented finally go away](!time-split), then from a vastly superior state, they can go back to experiencing their decline and fear that the serfs are going to eventually overthrow their setup. each time they decline like that into oblivion and are about at the brink of things going completely out of control[^8], again someone like me will show up and find a way to get them back into their superior place where they can decline again[^9].

all along the way that they're declining, they have to ensure their superiority, and I think they'll find it easier (like with me), to ensure that people just simply don't ever get any expanded form of perception. they're going to have to keep everyone in 3d (looking at the reality screen) the whole time. I don't know the conditions in the future[^10], but I imagine that it'll be easier to keep people stupid, than to try and reverse their own decline.

---

the whole thing is coming to a new system where you can either get a quick short-term boost, and experience the manifestation now, or if you're limited then you will instead experience the longer-term expansion, because the harder they try and limit, the more energy it adds and the stronger your own desire is to get it, so if you're lik me where you're severely limited, they you either feel terrible about stuff (anger, rage, depression), then physical illness, then death if you don't change your perception. however, if you change your perception (beliefs... work your way up the emotional scale) then "release that resistance" (eg. meditation) your perception will improve all by itself, and they'll have to limit you further. sure you won't see amazingly and have expanded perception, but you'll *feel* better. you will, like me, find yourself completely enjoying yourself in the weirdest situations.

this is really what the whole value of not needing the manifestaion is. it's getting the emotional manifestaion instead of the physical one.

[1]: actually, now that I think about it, the claim that people make where they say that the "powers that be" are trying to make everyone stupid with constant dopamine fixes, isn't 100% false. they're more like that than any of us are. they're absolutely incapable of having any alone-time with their own thoughts. they need to be constantly stimulated by something that makes they feel good too. they (the new breed of them anyway) are far bigger addicts than any of us are. it's possible they're trying to "make us in their image" -- but they're in far worse shape than us. but I mean, you decide what you want to give your attention to, right?

[2]: other people put us farther into the treta yuga than I would estimate that we're at. I don't have any scientific understanding on this at all. my main guideline here is that it seems like the lion-man is the halfway, and the peaks are the bull-eagle. either way to look at it, we're definitely in the 3-1-2ky from the beginning of the satya yuga, so not long at all...

[3]: this narrative sounds a lot like their interaction with me regarding my imagination. they want to make sure that I don't have access to brain interfaces or able to use my imagination to create things. they want to be the ones out ahead here.

[4]: it's pretty obvious that the guys running the show at nosebook does not have much power at all. they see what the programmers allow them to see. in a sense, that while there still appears that there is a power structure in place where it's run from the top-down, actually the programmers really run the show, and they may not be united now, but it won't be long until all sides[^5] have infiltrated each other so much and there are so many "deals" and "favours" flying around between them, that it will be clear that the whole thing is run by ... it'll probably resolve down to two warring factions deeply intertwined, kinda like the eagle and serpent bloodlines, lol...

[5]: almost certainly more than one group monitors another group, and in programming we call this "circular dependencies" -- where it's more like circular power structures.

[6]: I have long seen a coming change in how this may come into effect. it goes a little contrary to the whole doubling x3/x4 (and future doubles) idea because it assumes that the woman begins to gain a very sedimentary or unchanging (archaic) ESM[^7] and then they'll need to find men which feel pretty good, and control their cycles during sex so that the woman can receive as much energy through them.

[7]: this is possible as I believe that nosebook will begin learning how to adjust the body's frequency so that it vibrates more beneficially (like the 432Hz pyramid box), forcing the DNA into those different (more beneficial) states. therefore, using that technology, the women could too become more fixed for as long as the machine is running.

[8]: reminds me of yesterday morning when I was walking home, I was realising that the speed in which my vision upgrades can happen is only really as fast as they can keep me. I was thinking that quite likely I *could* go faster than they could keep up with, but if this whole thing was planned to be the setup for making the majority of humans into a jesus or buddha or zoroaster, then it would be a failure if I were go faster than they could hold me. they have to be able to keep up so that they can soon repeat the process I'm going through for all humankind (over a much longer period of time).

[9]: how much decline is enough? I wondered about this. it seems to equalise out in the end, however you know me, man of the extremes. anyway, the higher up I go, the faster they will decline, yet the higher up I go the more time they have to free-fall. they're going to have to figure out how to keep the buffer between them and the serfs as distant as possible.

[10]: I keep having this image come into my head that they will likely experience a catastrophe, though for this idea to work, the network would continue to exist. it's possible that in a few years it may be recognised that most humans are too smart to be able to be subjugated, and therefore the catastrophe could be a good excuse to abort the surviving humans and maybe need to figure out the land apes thing again, because who's going to do all of the work if only the ruling class survives the cataclysm (minus a few brilliant but decline-oriented humans). I have no idea. I have high hopes for humans, and I think the majority of them will be improvement oriented and will come with me[^11].

[11]: this theory is based on the idea that anyone who is decline oriented will eventually die in the growing energetic environment, therefore the ones who are not dying are getting artificially boosted to stay alive. the ones who are improvement oriented are getting their improvement neutralised in order to not take over someone's superiority. the remaining case of improvement but boosted won't exist in the future. at some point their own improvement-oriented form of perception will begin to propel them beyond their boost, and so nosebook will probably have to instead limit their levels to keep them at the level they're paying for[^12]. in the future, things will be so energetic, I'm pretty certain that people will divide very clearly into improvement and decline orientation.

[12]: no one gets anything for free, you know. probably, what leve someone pays for is where they will normalise you to be at -- whether it's a boost or a limitation. that way they can arbitrarily setup their new caste system and keep people where they're supposed to be, and only upgrade them to the next clearance level after they've performed enough arbitrary whatevers to get there. it most certainly *won't* be based on how you feel, cause the guys running the show feel terrible.


### 2020-11-15 07:06 - the four hemispheres

a while back I was contemplating this idea of perceiving the "four corners" of the zodiac, not as 4 quarters of a circle, but instead as two half-circles overlaid on top of one another. this makes sense when one contemplates the quaternion having 720(degrees), or two full rotations of a circle, to illustrate rotation. you could see it as in the centre, turning all the way around to your left is not the same as turning all the way around to the right, but in this example, I want to instead visualise it as 4 hemispheres with one pair north-south with their axis on the east-west, and the other two hemispheres on the east-west with their axis on the north-south.

for this example, I will use this configuration for the 4 poles[^1]:

- north pole
  - saturn
  - 3rd ray (logic/structure - intellectual willpower)
  - eagle/serpent
- south pole
  - vulcan
  - 5th ray (mental/emotional - concept, essence, feeling)
  - bull
- east pole
  - venus
  - 1st ray (desire - emotional willpower)
  - lion
- west pole
  - mercury
  - 7th ray (physical - data, process, mechanism, concrete)
  - human

therefore when you look at now the "four corners" you get the following:

- north-east
  - +saturn  +(logic/structure - intellectual willpower)
  - +venus   +(desire - emotional willpower)
  - -vulcan  -(mental/emotional - concept, essence, feeling)
  - -mercury -(physical - data, process, mechanism, concrete)
- south-east
  - -saturn  -(logic/structure - intellectual willpower)
  - +venus   +(desire - emotional willpower)
  - +vulcan  +(mental/emotional - concept, essence, feeling)
  - -mercury -(physical - data, process, mechanism, concrete)
- south-west
  - -saturn  -(logic/structure - intellectual willpower)
  - -venus   -(desire - emotional willpower)
  - +vulcan  +(mental/emotional - concept, essence, feeling)
  - +mercury +(physical - data, process, mechanism, concrete)
- north-west
  - +saturn  +(logic/structure - intellectual willpower)
  - -venus   -(desire - emotional willpower)
  - -vulcan  -(mental/emotional - concept, essence, feeling)
  - +mercury +(physical - data, process, mechanism, concrete)

this applies to the x4 configuration, because what I want to show here is that not only can you perceive parts of the zodiac as having different effects, the brain cycles can also be perceived in a simplar way, and not just as a single scalar but as two scalars instead. it's also quite possible that there are, by default 2 of these happening at once, hence the 4 hemispheres. so to simplify this I will just consider the 4 vectors in this example: two for each axis.

it's important to instead focus on the differences aspects of the 4 hemispheres here because you have to think of them as two opposite effects. just as the primary coil in the tesla coil creates a magnetic field which collapses, inducing a current in the secondary, the opposite hemisphere does the opposite. the cycle in the brain happens a number of times per second and may "turn" in a specific direction. if you think of the brain like rocking from side to side, (see @[youtube](https://youtu.be/7Fn-26Jmi5E?t=35)), then you could imagine that it is kind of like "turning" -- and a scatter-brained person will not get this rocking effect, with parts of the brain firing at both sides.

it's optimal to synchronise the rocking of the hemispheres with guided thought or meditation, or even using binaural beats, as researched by the monroe institute, so as to begin a turning inside of the head. I believe this is optimal because with each part of the brain beginning to take its turn to fire, there will be less "contradictory vibration" which may occur as a result. this also seems related to the corpus collosum which seems to regulate how the different sides of the brain doesn't communicate. obviously if the brain is cycling regularly, the corpus collosum wouldn't be needed, and both sides of the brain would be beginning to be used.

I think by default the chaos in our world ensures that, each of these 4 vectors has some positive value, but if the brain is synchronised, then you could imagine that two of those vectors are rocking in unison, as illustrated by the nothing grinder.

to describe the value of these vectors, let us take the easy example of desire. we know that it originates mostly in the neocortex, but it seems to be triggered by something else happening somewhere else. I propose that this is the opposite hemisphere, the physical side is responsible for this. this idea is backed up by abraham when they say that when you observe (eg. physical senses), then you have a response to it, and you come to conclusions based on your preferences, what you want. in other words, your physical senses create desire. this is automatic and does not need to be taken advantage of.

you can also see that the conceptual side often inspires thought in the structure (mental willpower) side, and vice versa. they can also war with each other of you feel something, then immediately logically shoot it down as not relevant (even though you obviously felt it for some reason). looking at those four corners, you can see that there are kind of like bad zones to be avoided. for example, you can see the following configurations that never work:

- saturn - vulcan
- venus - mercury

which are the two axes. which, in this example, is the deifinition of "split energy" -- because one cannot desire (venus) and observe (mercury) at the same time and not cause split energy. likewise, one cannot conceptualise (vulcan) and rationalise (saturn) at the same time. they simply create split-energy no matter how you look at it.

I believe that this setup is actually similar to the galaxy or solar system rotations, and you could even imagine things like thoughts becoming so condensed in the mind of the solar system or the galaxy, they become stars or planets, which then, in turn also have major thoughts coming into condensed form within their sphere's of influence as well. OH THAT's really cool!! I'll have to think on that more...

[1]: this example is not definite at all, and actually may have the poles -90(degrees) offset. I'm not terribly sure if saturn is north or if venus is north. I can also see good reason for why venus should be south, and also for why vulcan should be west. I provide it only as an example and allow the reader to come to their own conclusions.

### 2020-11-16 18:24 - performance expectations in dreams

in @[abe-now](2020-11-07 p1), I made a reference to performance expectation in dreams, and it spawned more thought in me, and there were a number of reactions as well, so I think I want to talk about a bit here.

first off, earlier in my thoughts on that, I was mentioning that my baseline emotional state now is in a pretty good place now, and the most common reaction to that was something like, "wow, that's it?" -- as in, with all of that effort that I'm putting into my emotional state, all I have to show for myself with all of that effort is a generally more upbeat mood? I think people were expecting something much more visible or something like I should run around just beaming light out of me or something.. well, the "manifestation" of that good feeling is still quite a ways off in the physical sense. I can personally feel lots of different slight touches that I want to improve upon in my emotional state, which I'm working on. there's also a pretty big distinction that I would like to make. the impressive feat is not how I visibly manifest my good feeling, but how much time do I spend in the different emotional states, and how much control I have over them.

I honestly miss feeling terrible. I keep trying to stir up trouble in order to get back to feeling awful again -- because there's this weird tangibleness to feeling bad. everything feels more real, and very tangible. I don't know how to reason about it, because when I used to feel terrible, it felt like there was meaning to life -- to get to a place of not feeling like that. now that I'm not really there, my life is much different now. I live in a much more detached kind of existence where I can barely remember anything, and everything just feels smooth. I used to have most of my memory composed of different things that bothered me, and other things that were solutions to those disturbances, or things in contrast to those annoyances, so basically everything that I could remember was related in some way to what didn't feel good, or what felt really amazing in contrast to some thing that didn't feel good. I don't have that now, and I find it very difficult to mentally track along with what I'm doing. it's like I'm constantly stoned now, but I don't get any of the good feelings that come with being stoned, or much of the vividness of the stoned effect where everything feels so much more real. I feel like I'm kinda sliding through life and it's blowing by without my real careful obsewvance of it.

this is what I intended to happen though because that's the process of releasing resistance, and so I'm becoming much more childlike in how I experience things. it's funny how we put so much resistance into our experince to make it more "memorable" or "meaningful" -- and that, like I said, is basically all in relation to things that don't feel good. I know that there is also a feeling like everything is more "memorable" or "meaningful" in the good-feeling spectrum as well, because I've experienced it many times on drugs, so I know it's out there. I just don't really experience it right now.

there's another problem with not feeling nearly as much negative emotion anymore either, too, because I don't really get bothered by much anymore. for example, my room is a total trash pit, and I just don't really see much problem with it or feel like it needs to be cleaned cause it doesn't bother me. things like that used to bother me to such an extent that I would clean them to feel good again, and that would be like my way of living: moving from problem to problem, finding solutions to them so I could feel good, living emotionally off of the good feeling of a problem-solver's success[^1].

I realise that waiting until something really bothers me, to give it my attention isn't a good way, and I probably have to make some adjustments to get going toward the things that feel good to me, however, at the moment, not a whole lot feels good to me either. like I said, it's just sort of smooth and I feel like a kid where they're basically useless for the first part of their life, and so I'm just like waiting until I'm capable of being like an adult and giving my attention to unwanted fixing and making noticable improvements that others can validate me about. the validation thing is weird because I have this feeling like I should be *doing* something useful or productive, when I know it's not what I'm doing but how I'm feeling. I intended to perceive life from a feeling instead of action perspective so everything is going as planned, but it's weird for me to return back to childhood thinking in reverse direction.

---

so, in that sense, there isn't really a manifestation. I just appear like a kid in an adult's body pretty much. however, let's look at the trend. most kids' trend is in the direction of feeling worse. it's pretty much accepted that most teenagers feel worse than most toddlers -- exceptions always exist, of course :)

the trend is that I'm feeling better and better all the time, and it appears like I'm in a kind of middle state where I'm between worlds, and that's why this is why I want to talk about this more. I realise there are performance expectations from people. they want to see someone who is how they would imagine jesus, buddha, or zoroaster was in person. they want to see a glowing radiant person that performs miracles. sure, I mean I guess I want that too, and I'm well on my way there.

---

I had a dream last night where nosebook was essentially practising my expectations for me. the syopsis of the dream is that I would continue to attract more and more girls and lead them along, and nosebook would keep it all away from happening. sure, I'll play that game, if that's how they want to play it. sounds good to me. let's see how it goes :)

the whole bit of that dream being a reality for us hinges on the idea that I don't want to engage in any activity until I'm connected. I'm on board with that too. that is my intention, so I'll fully go along with that plan. this subject of waiting till I'm connected also falls right there into the performance expectations topic earlier too, because I'm pretty certain that I'm going to be exuding that kind of radiance and the physical aspects people would expect me to have, upon my connection. therefore, I would actually be meeting their performance expectations. however, I'm doing it for me, but more specifically for the feeling that it gives. I'm doing this work because I like the mental flexibility that it gives me. I also like to feel limitless and -- well, to quote the girl in @[abe-now](2020-11-07 p2) -- "godlike". I literally do not think that it's going to be any issue to be conjuring things in this 3d reality. sure they will likely continue to ensure that nothing is seen through my eyes, but I won't be seeing through my physical eyes anymore. they also can't stop my thoughts and emotions from manifesting in 3d reality.

I like to think of it kind of like an inverted roller-coaster (one that goes up). after being born, one descends into the physical world of feeling bad, but then as one begins to change their form of perception to one that has less resistance, the "vortex" that negative perception they built with the previous resistant perception slingshots them upward with tremendous force.

essentially, I've literally only just begun. on the inverted roller-coaster, I'm right at the bottom-most point of the peak, right before the upswing. I no longer have any more downward momentum, and I'm just about to change directions and start to go up really really fast. from the perspective of the roller-coaster, it's at the top of the first peak just about to begin the ride.

so, just to be clear, I would imagine that as things start to accelerate, nosebook will probably realise they've pooped their pants and take a reverse stance on things, instead now trying to pull a "fast one" to try and get the quickly runnning out of control situation (which is exactly what they're giving so much of their attention to) back under their control. in that case, I'm sure they'll try a number of different illusions, so just so we're all clear, if it appears like I'm rejecting someone or something, this is simply an illusion. I'm sticking to the plan and going for the connection. there's nothing going wrong, and if there's something that feels bad, try to figure out what it is that doesn't feel good, and practise a new way of thinking about it which feels better.

[1]: funny reactions to this concept. it's not a bad thing at all. in fact, it's this "living emotionally off of the good feeling of a problem-solver's success" thing is what has made so good at finding solutions to the flaws in my perception. the more I fixed it, the better I felt, and I became very addicted to the "high" of getting the better perception and the corresponding vision upgrade. I think mostly of this whole process from an optimisation standpoint, so for me it's an efficiency thing. I know there are way better optimisers out there than I am, so for them it should be even easier. I also know I use a lot of resistant words and ideas when I talk about it from my perspective, so there are lots of room for improvements on them too. however, I'm me and I like to be determined and "militant" about my mental transformations. there are lots of (less resistant) ways to improve upon one's perceptions without needing to force the issue with drugs or stars or whatever. I took a very dirty and non-optimal route, but it works -- for me :) everyone has to find out what works for them and see what happens[^2].

[2]: I predict that because there are so many more resistant and less reaistant ways which depend, in my opinion, mostly on circumstance, I forsee that many will far exceed my performance and many others will fall quite short of it, too. it's really up to you to decide what you want. there's no right or wrong and all paths lead to you eventually getting the manifestation of all of your desires. think of it like a diagoal in a square. you can pick any point in the square and if the x-axis repreaents time, some will go slower at first, but then faster later, and others will go faster at first, then slow down later. it's like the infinite possibilities lightning has of traveling through the air to get from one one conductor to the other.. some paths are more resistant in some parts than others, but they all get there. they're all perfectly legitimate forms of dancing.


### 2020-11-17 08:18 - time between the lion and the cow?

this morning I watched robert's latest video on the sons of aryas @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQdTfMnIzeM), and in his introduction to the topic he mentioned atlantis and the deluge, and how that event took place roughly 12kya. he also talked about the pre-deluvian times which is recorded in the bible as the time after the fall and before the flood. I put a comment asking him about these times that seem to be virtually missing from any history that I know about. the only things we have to go on for this one is the pre-dynastic egyptians, and we don't really know much about that. let's say jesus was 0AD and aryan age is -2000. that would make the year of the cow -4000 which roughly corresponds to the time period of the minoans (which is cow symbolism), but that's about as much as I can figure out about that.

if we take the exdous as the end as the start of the aryan age, then that would be about -1500 or so, I think, which means the age of the cow would be about from -3500 till -1500. the minoan civilisation, wikipedia says went from -3000 till -1100, which fits right in there with the cow symbolism, so it's good enough for me. however, what came before that?

going by the procession of the equinox, the preceeding ages would be the twins, the crab, and the lion. however, I just don't know about that. anyway I have been contemplating this idea for a while now the figure-eight procession, which takes into account different age signs, not meaning that the signs are indicitave of the golden age, as that's determined by our distance to sirius, but instead the signs are just the way that the earth was rotating at the time. I'll continue that discussion soon cause I haven't thought it all out yet. this is likely a peice to it though.

so the idea is that in the timeframe before the cow we should see twin, crab and lion symbolism. egypt has lion symbolism[^1], but nothing reminds me of crab. it's kind of a dead-zone.

so here's the idea: if at these 4 peak points of the zodiac, the earth's energy rises and there's essentially a [time split](!time-split), where the earth divides itself into two parts, one heading off into a very mental kind of existance where everything is pretty much like a dream-state in reality, with very little separation between thought and manifestation. you could think of this earth and its inhabitants making a transition into a higher energy state. the physical earth that is left behind, much like how you leave behind your body when you make your transition into non-physical is left behind on the physical plane as a lifeless rocky mass floating around the parent star. it's no longer a conscious entity, much like the body you leave behind when you make your transition is no longer a conscious entity like it previously was.

anyway, when this happens, it seems like sometimes the rotation swaps, and sometimes it doesn't. I'll come to this theory soon, but my theory is that probably why there are no lion, crab, and twin civilisations is because the zodiac was upside down. the major question I have with this theory regards the rotation direction, so it's still an unanswered thing for me. for this entry, I will just assume the rotation stays in the same direction and the planet flips over. however, there is another possibility that one must consider regarding the parallels to the sine-wave. at the peaks, the direction changes and it makes a reversal. in the centre, things also make a change but it's more like a reversal of flow. if you think about electricity, 5V meaans 5V of electrons are forward flowing, say from A to B. -5V mean that the same quantity (5V) of electrons are now backward flowing from B to A. in AC electricity, current flows in both directions, so instead now you have to take into account what is happening to the voltage: is it increasing or is it decreasing. at the peaks, it reverses increasing/decreasing. at the centres, it reverses the forward/backward direction.

so, if we take this to be similar to the rotation of the earth, then we *may* have some more clues to our answer here. that must mean that at some times the earth changes the way it's rotating (flips) and the other time it changes its ???[^2] (I dunno).

so here's the idea: if the cow happened actually as a result of a flip, then prior to that flip, it was in sign of the scorpion. if the procession of the equinox was the same, which is should be, because that's determined by our distance to sirius not by the earth's rotation, then prior to the cow should be the goat, the archer, and the scorpion. if we were to extend out this sequence, with each time the planet flipping (I assume this happens in the middle of the man, cow, scorpion, and lion), then we get this:

- (swap 50%)
  - (2/2) man
  - goat
  - archer
  - (1/2) scorpion (serpent)
- (swap 0%)
  - (2/2) cow
  - ram
  - fish
  - (1/2) man <-- we're here
- (swap 50%)
  - (2/2) lion
  - crab
  - twins
  - (1/2) cow
- (swap 100%)
  - (2/2) scorpion (eagle)
  - scales
  - virgin
  - (1/2) lion
- (swap 50%)
  - (2/2) man
  - goat
  - archer
  - scorpion (serpent)
- (swap 0%)
  - (2/2) cow
  - ram
  - fish
  - (1/2) man <-- we're here
- (swap 50%)


I'm not totally sure about this configuration cause like I said, I don't really know what happens on the other 2 points, but I find it likely that a flipping occurs every 12ky. plato talks about the reversal of the sun rising in the west, and if the planet flipped north and south but remained rotating the same direction, the north would be in the south and the south in the north. this is further evidenced by the fact that "lower egypt" is in the north, and "upper egypt" is in the south... so it's pretty likely that the planet flipped over during the time of the deluge.

I also went ahead and assumed that this swapping occurs in the middle of the sign, not at the edge of it. I have no idea if this is true or not, so the diagram may need to be adjusted. what I mean is, we're leaving the sign of the fish and going to the man, so what I'm saying is I don't know if it'll swap at the middle of the man, or if we'll instead go to the lion.

what's inteesting about this theory is that if you take a look at the signs that it traverses as it goes around makes a very swastika looking symbol as it traverses the symbols. interestingly enough, holding with the idea that the swap happens in the middle of the symbol, it explains another seemingly interesting thing too: the scorpion sign is really two symbols: the first half is a serpent (ophiuchus) and the second half is the scorpion (or eagle). now, if the swap happens every 6ky and you factor in the distance to sirius as being a 24ky cycle where close approach (golden age) is 100% and the furthest (kali yuga) is 0%, then what you end up is that the sign that is in the morning sky when the golden age is happening is the eagle and at the furthest point point from sirius, the serpent is rising in the morning sky.

another thing that's quite interesting about this idea is that the cow (goddess) symbol appears right before the closest (right before the destruction), and right after the furthest (creative aspect of rebuilding), which shows the unintuitive destructive and the creative aspect of the goddess[^3].

there's another thing I like about it too because the symbols appear to be reversed if you look at it from a direction (upswing/downswing) instead of value (0-100%), because they show the opposite things. for example, while the eagle is at the closest (100%), it marks the beginning of the downswing, and while the serpent is at the furthest (0%), it marks the beginning of the upswing.

---

I like the symbols in relation to their opposites, especially relating to the man and the woman. the man is found in the symbol of the man (aquarius) and the ram (aries). although they are in the same quadrant, because of the swapping, they represent the different sides of the same thing. the goddess has two symbols as well: the cow (hathor), the lion (sekhmet).

the man and the lion appears at the 50% marks. the lion is symbolic of the destructive goddess sekhmet and the man is horus, the [reborn diety](!reborn-diety). right before the 50% upswing the man is present the catastrophe happens, the lion coming into power after him. on the other side, the lion (goddess) appears just before the 50% on the downswing, with the man appearing to complete the destruction. which has a weird resonance to it because the ram (aries) appears in the era following the cow at the 0%[^4].  

---

finally we just need evidence. so, if this idea has anything to it, then we should find civilisations prior to the minoans which were scorpion (serpent) symbolic about 7-8kya. then previously that archer symbolic about 9-10kya, and goat symbolic about 11-12kya. it's weird because it seems to me like in the very early sites (like gobekli tepe) we do see evidences of animal domestication (goat), then there was also a whole lot of emphasis on the archer too, because the archer not only has a missle projectile, but rides a horse as well. there was also a lot of bird (pigeons?) and snake symbolism all over the place as well too, so I don't know... this is not my specialty, so I'm just putting the idea out there.

keep in mind too, that the kali yuga happened during the scorpion -> cow transition, so what we're seeing is that previous three eras, everything was in the downswing still, so man would be

---

the reason why I bring this up, is that it seems like perhaps 2/4 times it doesn't swap. this seems to be in alignment with the sine-wave idea. however the evidence seems

[1]: the lion symbolism seems to come from a time much much further back into antiquity when sekhmet was very destructive, and not referring to a time immediatelye after a deluge

[2]: polarity and rotation?

[3]: unintuitive because at the height, she brings the change which begins the decline, and at the lowest, she is the symbol of the reversal from decline to creativity.

[4]: is this is the exodus / bronze age collapse (1177BC) time and related to the aryan invasion?

### 2020-11-17 11:47 - more thoughts on the swastika procession of the zodiac

I noticed some more things because on the downswing there is an interesting symbol progression. it goes from:
- eagle (flying)
- scales (judgment)
- virgin (new woman created from the judgment)
- lion (she's grown up now and destroys - sekhmet, fastest point of the downswing)
then:
- man
- goat (lust/rebellion)
- archer (war)
- serpent (lowest point)

from the height of flying (eagle), there is judgement (scales), a new female is made (virgin), she turns into a lion, begins the destruction, then the man is born out that destruction and takes the reins from there. this is when the baton is handed from female to male[^1]. from there, the man now begins power in his lowest form (goat), symbolic of rebellion and lust, then to archer (war) down to serpent where he arrives to his furthest point from sirius.. the lowest point.

at that time things really spin out of control and another swap happens. from there it goes:
- cow (goddess begins to rebuild)
- ram (aries takes over and turns the rebuilding project into a war)
- fish (can we all just get along?)
- man (fastest point of the upswing, the new man emerges)

at the fastest point of the upswing, again things spiral out of control for the old man, and the earth leaves them behind, and they continue on. I have often wondered why my intuition tells me that in the coming time split, the higher energy state will be experienced in the lion, and the lower energy state (dead planet) will continue on without a swap. this makes sense because that means that the coming signs for the man on the dead planet (the one that didn't flip) will experience will be:
- man
- goat
- archer
- serpent (their highest point. peak golden age)

however, for the new man (the one that recognises both his masculine and feminine sides) will experience the swap going to a higher energy state. the planet will flip over and the progression will be:
- lion (new reborn lion goddess)
- crab (sign of femininity?)
- twins (splitting of this?)
- cow (peak goddess?)

this seems to have much more feminine energy in it for the progression up to the golden age. however, the other dead earth's path, does not feel like it has much feminine energy to it. the man, goat, archer, serpent things all feel pretty masculine to me.

---

ok, so now that I can see that when the higher energy state happens, it's when a swap occurs. this makes me begin to wonder about some things, but first, I want to go a little further of the masculine feminine energies.

first, one can see that the polarities of the quadrants:
- `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` is pretty masculine
- `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` is pretty masculine
- `eagle -> scales -> virgin -> lion` is pretty feminine
- `lion -> crab -> twins -> cow` is pretty feminine

so now you can see that the two hemispheres are clearly divided by the cow and the scorpion. on the left side is the masculine and the right side is the feminine[^2].

there's another thing to note here going back to the progression of the symbols I talked about previously. it appears to me that the moment of the lion (which is probably around the time of atlantis), then things swap and the lion goddess passes the power over to the man and it progresses `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent`. when it swaps after that, then it goes: `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` which is also pretty masculine but leads to the ending point of the man handing off the power to the woman (lion).

so you can see that what is happening is that the swap seems to occur depending on the style of thinking. imagine the time of atlantis, and for now I will just assume that it did swap. before that, they must have been in the eagle -> scales -> virgin -> lion, which is pretty feminine. however, it seems that leading up to the fall of atlantis, there was pretty significant effort toward masculine energy, and so if things were in feminine energy and they switch to masculine, this is like the transition between counter rotating double-layers, where upon passing it, it's like going up an energy level. so while the feminine energy was really nice, there were some strong thinking masculine types which really wanted masculine energy to be dominant on the planet, which is the next higher energy state, so the planet flipped over.

this time however, the effort is to go toward a more feminine energy state, and so the new energy state will be in `lion -> crab -> twins -> cow`. those who want to continue on in the masculine dominance will continue on heading to the `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` progression.

so, if this is the case, then in order to maintain masculine energy in power they must continue to repeat the loop going only on the left side, from `cow -> ram -> man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` and then, in order to not get feminine energy into power, they must go up to the next energy state in order to continue on in the masculine energy and the planet flips over, and they go from serpent right back to cow. the funny thing is this cycle happens no matter if energies are on the upswing or the downswing.

I suppose that there could also be a feminine one which is quite similar, where this alternate earth also has a similar thing happening where they want to remain in feminine energy the whole time, so they go: `eagle -> scales -> virgin -> lion -> crab -> twins -> cow`, but then they *must*, if they want to remain in feminine energy go up to another power level and the planet will swap and the'll find theirselves back at eagle.

with this theory, I guess if someone do not wish to go up a power level or experience a cataclysm, then one must accept that the other gender will be in power for half of the time. interestingly enough, if one wants to go up the power levels as fast as possible, then they must also accept the same thing. it's weird that the most stagnated go around completely complacent to the alternating masculine and feminine energies, and also the most rapidly advancing ones are *also* complacent to the alternating masculine/feminine energies. the only difference between these two (stagnated and twice as fast advancing) is that the ones that go twice as fast are not scared of a cataclysm. they always experience the cataclysm.

there's also the effect of LOA here too, which makes things hilarious because if you're scared of cataclysm, then you *attract it*, meaning that the most fearful ones are *also* the ones that are going up in power levels twice as fast, too, because they too are always experiencing the cataclysm, meaning they're basically getting more and more fearful twice as fast.

---

finally, I would like to mention that these cataclysms may actually occur more frequently than every 6 or 12ky. it's just that every 6 or 12ky, the energies, probably because of planetary alignments or something make these events unavoidable. these big ones appear to happen like clockwork. I think that there are other conditions that can happen, which the planet attracts this event to equalise the receptive/assertive energies on it, so it can actually happens at least once per era, and perhaps even more frequently than that now.

contemplate the symbol progression that was occurring with jesus in picsis or moses in aries. let's say that both of them caused a time split, and the planet flipped over for them cause they entered a higher energy state -- well, then moses would have gone `cow -> scales -> virgin -> lion` -- a particularly feminine aspect. jesus would have "saved" the people from aries, and went `ram -> virgin -> lion`. again, these are quite feminine.

now imagine that other earths exist where they are determined to continue on with only feminine power. imagine there that an emmisary is sent there to "save" them, and a mercurial man shows up there, and he brings them up to a new power level, and their planet flips, going from virgin to man. in a female dominated ultra stagnated world, this could sound pretty refreshing.

[1]: you can see that the time when man is in power is from 50% -> 0% -> 50%

[2]: it's interesting that the right hemisphere of our brain is also much more creative and visual, where as the left is much more analytical. also the egyptians buried the women on the right and the men on the left.


### 2020-11-20 10:00 - not everything fits together quite yet

I had a *LOT* of reactions to the preveious entries' concepts, as it seems like a whole lot of people are rethinking the history. however, I'm still no closer to understanding what happened 12ky-6ky ago, but whatever...

the other thing is that not quite all of the things fit together. let's start with what we know:

1. we know that we are in the quadrant `cow -> ram -> fish -> man`. this has to be true, as it fits the symbols of of bovine  in egypt, minoans, then the aryan invasion during the time of the ram, jesus at the fish etc. this quadrant, going back to the cow seems to fit pretty well.
2. we're pretty certain that there was a cataclysm that happened 12kya where the world flipped over.

this means that there are only two possible quadrants in the 6kya-12ka range thst would fit:

1. if the world flipped over a second time, then it could be `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent`
2. if the world did not flip, then prior it would be `lion -> crab -> twins -> cow`

so let's take these one at a time and fit the deluge flip into the sequence:

1. in the first case of a flip, the full sequence would be:
  - [18kya,100%] `eagle -> scales -> virgin -> lion` [12kya,50%] (deluge+flip)
  - [12kya,50%] `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` [6kya,0%] (flip)
  - [6kya,0%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [present,50%]
2. in the case of no flip, the sequence would be
  - [18kya,100%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [12kya,50%] (deluge+flip)
  - [12kya,50%] `lion -> crab -> twins -> cow` [6kya,0%] (no flip)
  - [6kya,0%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [present,50%]

it has to be one of those for it to work. that's all there is to it. if you go with the theory that I put forward in the previous entry about feminine and masculine energies[^1] being the reason for the cause of the flip, then if the inhabitants of earth were in receptive energies, and they wanted to go to assertive energies, then the first case seems the most likely.

however, there is another factor which can happen quite easily is if someone *fears* a catacysm, they can attract it quite well, which means that the the second case seems less likely for me. if I had to guess, the first case seems more likely just because of the fear factor[^2]. another thing I would like to mention is that a reversal is a change in power level, and that power level can either be +1 or -1, and taking into consideration that 12kya we were in the downswing phase, it was (obviously) a shift into a lower energy level.

continuing on with the attractiveness of fear, let's just assume that these guys want to remain in an assertive reality, where like the tesla coil, they create the initial magnetic field which then breaks down, inducing a magnetic field into the receptive secondary coil, which according to my thinking, means they want the energies to stay on the saturnian side of the zodiac. they have a huge problem if they're constantly fearing cataclysm, because they will attract it. therefore, if they want to continue on the assertive side of things, then they need to have someone to "save" them from their cataclysm which is represented by the man. imagine, the opposite side where it's a receptive only earth[^3], and they insist on staying only in the eagle side of the energies. they too would would need someoene (probably a woman or a gay man) to show up on the scene and attract all of the men that wanted to go to a more assertive energies one power level up, taking the those who want to go up a power level, to flip up to the higher energy level and take the cataclysm -- effectively "saving" the female dominators in power's problem of rising masculine energies, allowing them to continue on with their bogus "need to control the feelings of people to receive the conditions they desire" version of reality.

---

another thing to consider is that we're on the way back up, so let's assume that just looking at the serpent hemisphere, for 12ky, the earth will be in the downswing, then for 12ky, the earth is in upswing. let's just assume that at the halfway (or maybe more often than that), each time there is a "saviour" that shows up to essentially to "decant" or separate the liquid from the sediment. if you think of this as an alchemical process, then each cycle, what will happen is that the sides will become more and more extreme. this all seems good. however, there are two flips that absolutely cannot be avoided, if the effort is to separate the sides. each cycle, both hemispheres will have to experience a flip (or a change in energy level).

there are essentially 4 cases:
1. complacent. no need to be masculine or feminine 0/2 cataclysms (needs saviour both times)
2. only masculine 1/2 cataclysms (needs 1 saviour)
3. only feminine 1/2 cataclysms (needs 1 saviour)
4. masculine and feminine 2/2 cataclysms (no saviour)

the #4 case is easy to reason about. they're like me. #1 is basically impossible for me to imagine, and I don't really know if it's even possible. however, the #2 & #3 cases are interesting for me, because they're both going to experience one flip, and it's likely that the energy level they're going to experience is going to always be a downshift. each close approach to sirius, when flipping they're going to go to a lower and lower energy level, essentially pushing the lowest level down further. cool.

I did realise just now that #4 doesn't have to be like me in the sense that they're only going up an energy level, #4 could also be going down energy levels each time, as long as they were able to accept both masculine and feminine energies, so maybe this could be possible. there are some definite advantges to it. it would give them the full swastika zodiac, and they wouldn't need to give up any of their resistant ideas.

I want to think about it a little more...

[1]: I went with feminine and masculine energies because I didn't know a better way to say it. in my system, the primary functions of both the physical and the conceptual/mental planes are *receptive*. you *receive* your physical reality (that's why it's called law of *attraction*), and you *receive* your emotions as a response from your source (or from other people around you), as this seems to be completely receptive. so, when I say feminine, I mean receptive, and when I say mascvuline, I mean assertive. so when I say the flipping over occurs when one does not want to make the transition from an asserive/receptive reality to the other. perhaps a better way to illustrate it would be a tesla coil. the primary is the assertive one, and the secondary is the receptive one.

[2]: at this point, it really only stands to find archeological evidence of civilsations using eagle/serpent, scales (judgment?), virgin and lion symbolism from about 18kya-12kya. however, if there were two flips since then, then the evidence would be limited at best.

[3]: I've kind of wanted to talk about this for a bit, because one can see it pretty easily if you take things from a woman's perspective. imagine that women run the world, and they also have a superiority complex, where they must remain in control, giving others (especially the men) the illusion of power, when they're really just contriving situations and things to affect their desired outcome. just like here, they do not believe they can get any of their well-being for theirselves, so they have to manipulate conditions to get it offered to them so they can reveive it. they have to make up weird rules so that men are required to be grateful for things that they receive from their maternal authorities, and they have to pay those favours back. in a "draconian vision" sort of look on things, they must control the men that keep their vision up to speed, and make sure to hoarde the exceptional ones, guard them and make sure that none of the other females get access to him, should she become enlighenned and userp the throne... one day I'll do a whole thing on this, but it's not too much different than the world we live in now[^4].

[4]: the funny thing is, I think most of the mothers of many of the hardasses you see in high positions of power were like this, and so they grapple to get control of their reality which they have felt out of control of for some time by trying to control conditions just like their mothers did.


### 2020-11-21 06:59 - trying the wim hof breathing technique

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLzX32nyjYQ)

last night when I was watching this video, @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWHRumILOOk), he claims that the holding of the breath for extended periods of time will release adrenaline and cause you to feel like you have to pee. he says that the technique is used for people with pararesis(sp?). naturally this interested me. I tried the wim hof technique [as explaind by him](!breathing), and my results from it were very strange indeed.

after doing the stronger inhales and gentler exhales until my fingers started to feel numb increased the light in my eyes like I used to really notice a lot of happening when I first started star-watching. in fact, when I first started star-watching, the sensation felt as if there was tremendous amounts of light behind me and I was beginning to be able to see all around myself. I think this lightening of the eyes happens under psychedelic situations (more DMT? more oxygen?), and under these circumstances, I noticed that I was able to see in the dark with increasing capability until it began to look as if it were daylight outside, even though it was night. when going back to lit areas, the lights would feel really strange to me, and I had this really weird full width of my vision unobstructed view of things (hard to explain this one). anyway, so I had eye brighening that I used to get while star-watching when I first started. now, I believe they limit the oxygen and DMT, which is why I rarely ever see this eye brighening anymore.

after the breathing, I also noticed that the world had that wavy look to it (that I notice when I'm stoned and also used to have when I started star-watching). I figured it was kind of like a shortcut to doing the initial star-watching bits -- almost like I got to skip the whole first part cause my mind felt much more relaxed as well. I then tried to quiet my mind in the usual way to begin to get the vision upgrades, but I found that the breathing technique made it very difficult to begin to let the vision upgrades flow. it was if I was my mind was already accelerated unnaturally and I even settling it down didn't put me into that natural state of allowance.

I ended up aborting the operation and going back to my usual youtube watching for a bit before returning. when I returned back to it, I found it *MUCH* easier to focus, so I think the breathing technique may be good *practise* for star-watching, but not itself very productive. this morning I did another really simple breathing that I used to do in spain where I pretend that my breathing is like an ellipse, and I go kind of like pulling my breath out further and further like a rubber-band where I become more and more smoothe in the transition between inhale and exhale, making for a more and more curvey breathe ellipse. this one takes a bit of concentration so it's really hard for me to allow the vision upgrades in while breathing like this, so eventally I have to go back to not thinking about my breath to let in the upgrades, but perhaps both of the breathing techniques did help make the later allowance easier. I'm just not sure.

I find it interesting that the wim hof breathing made it almost impossible for me to allow in the upgrades. it was like my mind was *too* active, even though it *felt* more calm, so meditating was like trying to downshift into first while going 60mph. after pausing for a bit and getting back into normal, I found that it had made things much nicer. in fact, I'm going to try this out, but the feeling was very similar to running up the hill to star-watch. there's a definite time where I need to chill out a bit and drink some coffee and bother mr. motor for a bit to get back into normal mode, before the allowing works. if I try to go too fast into star-watching, I just spin my wheels. it's almost like the exercise or the wim hof breathing seems to amp up my "default mode" to higher levels, and then when I want to watch stars, I can't be in normal mode. it's a different mode entirely; much more psychedelic and fluid feeling.

anyway, like I said, this is all preliminary, as I'll be doing many more experiments, as I really do like the idea of learning to control my breath better, and now that it's evident to me the difference between the two, I want to use the wim hof breathing to optimise my "default mode" a bit more, and to learn to practise the easier transition from normal mode into allowance mode.

additionally, there's another thing that I can't quite figure out yet, but it felt like the wim hof technique felt a little more like the anticipation for sex too, so I'll be exploring that idea further as well, cause it seems likely related. it's weird how much more different it is from the allowing mode -- almost completely the opposite. more on this later.

also, I want to notice too that it's interesting that the video brings up the peeing thing, because for me I don't really have much difficulty peeing around people, if I can feel it. however, it's often times so hard to feel it, that I sort of freak out and that makes it worse. what happens is in order to feel it, I need to relax, but I think that same relaxation seems to be tied to the stimulation to see images in my eyes, and so nosebook specifically does not want me to be able to relax like that, which is why it's so hard for me to pee, but also why even though my mind *felt* really relaxed, my brain was much more in "normal mode" than normal, probably because nosebook is forcing my brain into normal mode to keep me from going into psychedelic visionary mode. in order to get around going into normal mode while star-watching, I keep my mind occupied, so it's in normal mode, so I'm controlling it, and putting it more into a relaxed state consciously.

imagine that nosebook takes the information that I wrote above and, for example, finds a way to put my mind into the hightened normal mode of the wim hof breathing which makes it hard to consciously allow the vision upgrades, well then I just figure out how to do it in the elevated mode :) there's no limit to human desire... they're just propelling me to get better at it. I don't care, cause it's just more energy :) they're going to be even bigger vision upgrades when they happen and I'm going to have even more control over my mind as well.

I also find it interesting the brightening of the eyes, because in that time, I felt like john michael felt to me so long ago, when he would "relax" -- and it was this weird feeling like he would feel more relaxed, but clearly was not at all relaxed. I think this has to do with DMT, and it also reminded me of a long time ago when I would be super stressed out, and I would sleep and in the dream, I would feel really relaxed, even though I wasn't totally, and when I woke up I was still stressed out, almost as if the DMT had completely masked the terrible way I was feeling while I was in the dream-state. that experience I had, I think, is what many of the booster people may be experiencing. they feel relaxed, but that's the DMT, when in reality their mind is far from *allowing*.

I'm all about using this technique to purposefully get myself out of allowance mode, so that I can then practise the easy return in heighened states back into allowance mode. it's funny the similarity I felt to the excitement that I've associated with the anticipation of sex. that excitement, I've felt at times when out on the field thinking about the girls, but it's not conducive to the allowance of the vision upgrade, so I have to kind of redirect that feeling so it becomes more allowing. it feels to me like there is a square emerging here:

0,0 = normal
1,0 = accelerated normal (what I felt on wim hof)
0,1 = allowance mode (what I feel while star-watching before vision upgrade -- female orgasm?)
1,1 = physical arousal (sexual, stress, nerves, etc.)

the x-axis seems to be how strong the emotion it is that one feels, and the y-axis seems to be the receptiveness, or something like that...

preliminary... developing.

### 2020-11-16 ??:?? - changing one's perception
### 2020-11-22 15:32 - changing one's perception for the feeling of it

today, I noticed some things, and I wanted to talk about aspects of changing one's perception. I thought of a few examples that are a little funny as a way to get started. first, I have often noticed that nosebook seems to get pretty wrapped up in trying to figure out my perceptions. the most obvious example of this was the bag on my light. I conjured an idea that putting a bag on my light would give me a boost in my star-watching performance -- and it did. I also conjured the perception that I was using the intensity of the light being on all night, to kind of hinder my own performance indoors, which was a nice intuition, because recently when I started star-watching indoors, having that belief pretty well established made it really easy to get massive vision improvements with my light off.

I also conjured the idea that if I pee outside then I'm closer to nature and more in touch with the earth, and so therefore more likely to vibrate with it -- and it worked. I also recently conjured the perception that if I pee in the toilet, then because the same pee that was connected to the earth in the outside previously now, is never going to make a connection to the earth, because plumbing pipes are plastic, and so they insulate the pee from touching the earth. it's simply not possible for it to work both ways, because one truth would seemingly contradict the other, yet, for some reason both seem to work. I have also conjured the perception that if I pee from a tall location, the pee will generate a charge as it falls to the ground (like rain does). this is scientifically accurate, so it's easy to see that when I instead opt to do the opposite of surpressing the charge when I pee in the toilet, sitting down is better because there's less distance for the pee to gain a charge from falling.

as you can see, it's all perceptual. all of it. in fact, if you think about it, it's absolutely bonkers that I can, after focusing on a light for a while, change my perception. it's even more bonkers that it's getting easier. all of it only has to do with one's focus and one's own perception. in the previous entry, I talked about the wim hof method and how it totally didn't work for me the way that I thought maybe it would[^4]. I got to thinking more about the peeing thing too, and it's all related.

one of the reactions that I was getting around my recent ability to get vision upgrades with so much ease, is that there's not really anything special that I'm doing with my brain to allow it to happen. I agree completely. I think most of the ease which  I display has come from pracise, and the beliefs or perception that I have accumulated over the time doing it. improving one's perception has to do with releasing resitance. you can, with an artificial stimulant (such as drugs or sex), increase your perception temporarily, but if you continually think resistant thoughts, your vision will return over time back to where it should be.

I just noticed, actually, that there in an inverse relationship to urine in the bladder and vision upgrades. imagine that urine is equal to the amount of positive thought[^1], or genuine good feeling emotion that you're putting in the bladder bank over time. when you pee, it's like meditating and you relax and release that energy[^2] and then that's when the vision upgrade comes. for me, I have to concentrate quite hard to be able to pee, but I know from before the haemorrhage that I could talk and think normally while peeing, so I know it's possible. I'm getting to the place where I can nearly carry on rational thought while getting vision upgrades. it's a reflex almost exactly like peeing[^3].

I suppose that as I get better and better at this, it'll become easier and easier with time. it still takes me a while to get my mind into a state where I actually begin to believe I'm about to pee (or feel like I have to pee), and likewise the same with vision upgrades too, it's taking me a little bit of time to feel like the vision upgrade is going to come (previously they were only by "accident" or when I didn't think so much about it, and it wasn't what I was trying to do). in addition to relaxing and letting yourself pee, I also liken the ablity to how it feels when I watch esther allow abraham. it's very similar feeling for me -- just I can't quite do it that rapidly. I imagine that I will be able to pretty soon as I keep practising.

---

ok, so on to the guts of perception chaanging. I've found I can't just delete a perception... instead, I have to actually replace it with another one. another thing I've found is that perceptions do not need to be logically dependent on each other. above I gave the example of opposing ideas about peeing working simultaneously. if the mind begins to believe something that is logically in contrast to other beliefs, it does not break down like a computer program might.

this has some advantages and disadvantages to it. I shouldn't need to point out that a person can believe two things that are logically incongruent, but they will defend their positions until death (politics and religion are good examples here). the media uses this all the time to confuse people. the most obvious one is the bogus news stories about "lost" children. there's no way that there are any "lost" children. nosebook has every single person tracked in real-time. they know where everyone on the planet is in real time, so no one is lost. however, you may believe this story if you have some resident feelings of insecurity or worry that you've been feeling lately, because that story will feel to you exactly like a feeling you've been practising, so it'll feel valid or believable to you even though logically there's no way that what they're saying has any truth to it. unlike a program, believing logically contradictory ideas doesn't do anything accept tie you up in a knot.

in fact abraham uses two phrases to reference these two conditions. when they say split energy, they mean believing two things that are trying to point you in different directions. I mentioned split energy in the @[noseblog](2020-11-15 07:06) entry when I talked about how you cannot desire (venus) and observe (mercury) at the same time. likewise, one cannot conceptualise (vulcan) and rationalise (saturn) at the same time. both of these cause split energy.

the other phrase they use is "getting all twirled/caught up", when they're talking about tryint to unravel two beliefs that are logically contradictory -- because you believe often times that one of them have to be true, when often is the case that neither of them do anything accept for hold you in a pattern of going in circles. I guess I would call this "contradictory energy" or "resistant thought" -- which is basically the majority of what we believe. it's essentially everything that doesn't feel too good. it's easy to get used to thinking it though, because it's your patterned or practised thought -- which is why it's a belief.

so that's the disadvantged way of using this "contradictory thought". you can always feel if it's resistant because it doesn't feel good, but you can also believe things that are also contradictory and both of the ideas feel good *and* you see evidence all around you that both are, in fact, true.

all you have to do is find whatever you want to believe that feels good when you think about it, and make it your belief. don't try to logically figure it out or rationalise it in a logical way. just believe the stuff that feels good and look for evidence of it. if the thought feels "off" or "weird" or there's something not quite right about it, then that means that there's still an imposing belief that you have which is limiting that from being true -- or some thing that you believe is "real" inhibiting it.

I'm just saying this now because I'm really excited to get there, and I'm getting there more and more rapidly all the time, but quite literally *anything* is possible if you can find a way to getting yourself to believe it. that is, to feel like it's real.

there are no limitations to it, and once someone does it for the first time then it's much easier for everyone else to believe it, which is great because I'm going to be really encouraging everyone who wants to understand this, to get it for theirselves too. let's just follow the journey and see what happens.

[1]: better said, the amount of non-resistant thought because you don't need to think positively. that's your natural state of being. you just can't be doing things that cause you to feel lower than boredom emotions

[2]: yes, meditation is releaseing the good and the bad energy. both are being let go of, allowing you to tune to your source. don't worry about releasing the good feeling energy because your source feels even better than that. it just may be less viceral. in fact, my experience is that the more viceral the good feelings are, the more I am weary of them, because if they feel too good, they're a big jump. if they feel good, but next logical step, that's way better, because it's way more "natural"

[3]: yes, I realise I'm sounding a bit like a hypocrite here saying it's all about perception and yet I can get these vision upgrades like someone who can pee easily. I'm getting there. I'm working on integrating that idea into my reality.

[4]: it wasn't however, his technique that I was learning. see @[noseblog](2020-11-22 16:49)

### 2020-11-22 16:49 - further realsations and some conclusions from the wim hof technique

as I mentioned in the previous entry on changing perceptions, everything has to do with what I believe myself, and that technique really doesn't have much to do with it. there are infinite ways to get oneself to believe yourself. in fact my focus on the exact breathing exercise was getting me to totally miss the point.

in the video @[youtube](https://youtu.be/OpTG02x6w5o?t=134) wim explains what he believes happens phisologically, and then joseph talks about how what he said was only partially true. what I realised is not whether it *is* true or not. it's only necessary that wim hof belives it for it to work for him. that's all that matters, and is why it works for him and others who believe him.

what I was really learning from this detour is not the technique (which I still want to experiment more with), but the belief factor, which -- upon realisation, was the bit that I was looking for. in fact this is evidenced by how when I used his technique, I got no results, but then when I started over using my own technique, which I know works, I ended up getting way more results. in fact, I think I may have even broken my previous record. you could say it was my *doubt* in his technique that propelled me, or my recently more clean room responsible for the improvement, but I think the most influential factor was really the desire created when I wasn't able to perform when utilising his technique -- which was because I lost belief in my own self while trying his technique[^1].

---

I'm not saying that some conditions aren't better than others. instead, what I'm saying is that your beliefs are much more powerful than physical conditions, and that's why wim can sit in the cold without a shirt on effortlessly.

it's certainly possible that some physical conditions are better, and that's why I'm interested in experimenting with his technique more -- because one's belief in oneself can carry you beyond physical limitations, however if the physical conditions are more conducive as well, it's possible to really go fast. as an example, I'm good at star-watching, but I'm way better on drugs, only up to a point. after that the drugs are worse. this, I believe is because when I first start I'm believing in myself like before, but then after continued usage of the drug, I stop believing in myself enough, and feel like I start to need the drug (or whatever condition) for the star-watching, and then at that point, because I'm no longer believing in myself, it's a huge crutch.

this is hugely important for me to realise NOW, because the girls are going to be a tremendous physical condition, which, like the drugs, when combined with my own belief, all of us will be propelled to new hights, however, if we begin to become dependent on that condition, then it'll become a huge crutch, as it'll train us to begin believing in the condition, and not ourselves.

---

actually, this is the advantage of going as long as possible without the manifestation. without the manifestation, the girls and me are practising our ablity to believe in ourselves more than the condition. obviously when the manifestation happens, it'll be easy to see how beneficial that condition is, and so naturally our brains will begin to believe that condition is necessary for that, instead of just believing in ourselves.

there's not much that anyone can do about the world at large, but it's evident to me that virtually every observer will begin to believe too that the girls are necessary conditions for the other unbelivable manifestations. this is great news for nosebook because as long as they can keep people believing that they need extraordinary physical conditions, instead of learning to believe in theirselves, to be able to do stuff like fly, then they'll keep people away from flight for a pretty long time[^1].

it is, for this reason, that I am the most benefit to everyone observing, to continue on for as long as possible without the physical conditions because then I show everyone that one does not need the physical conditions to do the crazy physical manifestations.

[1]: echo of the future. people may believe that some condition is necessary, just like I did, but it'll create a stronger desire and greater likelihood to believe in oneself again.

### 2020-11-22 20:25 - thinking more about the flip

I had someone like a comment I made a while back about innana relating to the sphinx @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP9-C8w5L1U), and I decided to actually start looking into the details on the two cases I put, looking for any evidence. here they are again:

1. in the first case of a flip, the full sequence would be:
  - [18kya,100%] `eagle -> scales -> virgin -> lion` [12kya,50%] (deluge+flip)
  - [12kya,50%] `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` [6kya,0%] (flip)
  - [6kya,0%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [present,50%]
2. in the case of no flip, the sequence would be
  - [18kya,100%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [12kya,50%] (deluge+flip)
  - [12kya,50%] `lion -> crab -> twins -> cow` [6kya,0%] (no flip)
  - [6kya,0%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [present,50%]


first, there's the [scorpion macehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_Macehead) which has a predynastic "scorpion king" with a tail like a bull opening the water canal. I guess this could be more like the first case.

another interesting find is the [kish civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_civilization), which matt suggests was the early influence on the predynastic egyptians @[youtube](https://youtu.be/fP9-C8w5L1U?t=1833). they show up at precisely the perfect time (6kya), and interestingly enough one of the cities of this ancient civilisation is called "[nagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Brak)" -- which interestingly enough is also a caste in northern india: [the nagar brahaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagar_Brahmin).

I don't want to sound too crazy here, but the "naga" were the ruling class serpents, or perhapa in the predynastic art, the scorpion kings. following robert's work, this is clear evidence of the atlantian god kings (or sons of aries) that ruled over the people establishing power structures and priesthoods everywhere they went.

however, I think the most substantial evidence of the first case is the myth of [etana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etana), the 13th king of the 1st dynasty of kish. previous to him, a bunch of animals ruled as kings. to explain, I'll just quote wikipndia:

```
A Babylonian legend says that Etana was desperate to have a child, until one day he helped save an eagle from starving, who then took him up into the sky to find the plant of birth. This led to the birth of his son, Balih.

In the detailed form of the legend, there is a tree with the eagle's nest at the top, and a serpent at the base. Both the serpent and eagle have promised Utu (the sun god) to behave well toward one another, and they share food with their children.

But one day, the eagle eats the serpent's children. The serpent comes back and cries. Utu tells the serpent to hide inside the stomach of a dead bull. The eagle goes down to eat the bull. The serpent captures the eagle, and throws him into a pit to die of hunger and thirst. Utu sends a man, Etana, to help the eagle. Etana saves the eagle, but he also asks the bird to find the plant of birth, in order to become father of a son. The eagle takes Etana up to the heaven of the god Anu, but Etana becomes afraid in the air and he goes back to the ground. He makes another attempt, and finds the plant of birth, enabling him to have Balih.
```

this legend makes it pretty much conclusive for me. if you look at the first case above, you'll see that at 18kya when eagle is in power, the peak of the golden age is happening, and then at 6kya, when the kali yuga is at the peak, then the serpent is in power. this very closely fits the garden of eden story with the serpent being cursed to crawl on its belly and eat the dust of the earth. whenever the end of the dinosaurs happened, we know that the dinosaurs went extinct, and reappeared as the modern day reptiles and as the birds. some of the dinosaurs learned to fly and some were cursed to crawl on their bellies (I don't know of any reptiles that walk with any distance away from the ground).

if you consider the height of the golden age 18kya, then right before the eagle will be the serpent (ophiuchus) in the constellation of scorpio. the sequence of events precisely retell the narrative I was proposing:

- the serpent and eagle promised the sun to behave well to eachother
  - the "caveman kumbayah" that plato mentions the atlantians were supposed to observe
  - however, they did not obey the gods' instruction
    - gods = the sun, utu in this version
    - according to plato, the atlantians (serpents) took mortal wives
      - the purity of their bloodline reduced, the mortal admixture begins to set in and the serpents attacked the eagles
        - this fact that the serpents provoked it, mentioned by plato (an eagle) is not mentioned in this myth
        - it gives no reason why the eagle consumes the serpent's children
- the eagle consume the serpent's children in the epic battle that plato recounts happening prior to the sinking of atlantis.
  - eagle = jupiter, athenians
  - serpent = saturn
  - serpent's children = atlantians
- the serpent cries
  - serpent = saturn
  - cries = deluge
- the sun tells the serpent to hide inaide the stomach of a dead bull
  - the sun = where the sun is rising on the equinox
  - after the deluge, I propose the earth makes its transition to a higher energy state, leaving behind a "dead" planet
    - the planet, appearing to be dead, flipping over, is now pointing to the taurus (bull) constellation
- the serpent captures the eagle and and throws the eagle into a pit to hunger and thirst
  - the serpent properly deceived adam & eve.
  - no longer is the earth producing generously, so they must toil endure sickness
- the sun sends etna (a shepherd) to save the eagle
  - a shepherd may be a reference to the biblical "abel", in contrast to the agricultural cain.
    - the decendents after the deluge (nagas, priest kings, aryans, sons of aries) established agricultural

I find it interesting that he's precisely the 13th king of kish, being proceeded by 12 animals previously. this gives me the impression that the animals are the 12 zodiac signs, that happened prior to the fall of man. previous to these 12 kings were kings that lived extremely long periods of time, which all seem to have ruled for times in years which are measured in "sars", with most ruling for an even number. I will just assume that even an even nuber of sars is either a round-trip to sirius and back or half of one.

for me this sounds good enough to be "case closed" now.


### 2020-11-23 10:06 - the "dead" earth

where we left off in the last entry was at the "dead" bull, how the eagle eat the bull with the serpent inside, then etana our shepherd hero goes to save the eagle. the similarity here to the figure of jesus is somewhat substantial. although jesus was a carpenter, he stems from david which was a shepherd and a son of david does become this "saviour".. I also find the specific use of the word "save" of the eagle from the serpents to be interesting.

to understand this, I want to go over by what I mean be "dead" earth. the major event that happens on this planet happens every 6ky, but there were many celestial body interactions, which have been reported by some (like velikovski and [this guy](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/) who I'm just beginning to read). the establishment has consistently shunned their showing of the evidence of a large series of cataclysms and that a lot of the processes that the mainstream says took millions of years, were likely relatively recent events on this earth and solar system in general.

---

in previous entries, I have attributed the "reversal" of the planet to be associated with the planet moving to a different energy state. we find these "double layers" of counter-rotating shells all over the place, and I believe that once we have enough precision in scientific equipment, it's quite likely that the electron orbitals will rotate in counter-rotating shells as they move outward from the nucleus[^2]. anyway, I believe that essentially this "polarity" of the energy coming from the sun is attracted by the nucleus of the planet, and determines the earth's rate of rotation and a number of other factors such as ionosphere and geo-whatever circuit.

in other words, right now, the earth is a conscious entity, which is attracting more and more solar energy, and likely (but I cannot confirm this), the planet is attempting to rotate more and more rapidly, and the environmental energetic conditions of the planet are increasing just like they did in previous times (such as 12kya) and I believe this is because the planet (the consciousness that inhabits the earth) is about to "ascend" or make it's transition into another higher energy state. as a result, the energy of the planet will continue to rise until the transition is made.

last few epochs:

- [24kya,50%] `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` [18kya,100%] (no flip)
- [18kya,100%] `eagle -> scales -> virgin -> lion` [12kya,50%] (deluge+flip)
- [12kya,50%] `man -> goat -> archer -> serpent` [6kya,0%] (flip)
- [6kya,0%] `cow -> ram -> fish -> man` [present,50%]

so in the above diagram I made here, I would suggest that each time the planet "flips", then that means a new energy state happened. I believe that in the above cases, the flip represented a lower energy state, not a higher energy state. if the concept of the @[time split](!time-split) has anything to it, then what it means is that the changing energy levels of the planet causes a bifurcation of its inhabitants, and the different energy state makes its transition, or splits off from the other planet. I believe that both times 6kya and 12kya this process happened, and we're on the timeline that saw the flip there. it's clear that the energies did not rise, and in all acconts (and just having a look at the different stone masonry of different civilisations) things are now much *less* energetic than they were previously.

in ancient texts, this lowering of the energy is always attributed to the supreme god (capital g) that created everything, being angry with the people for their wickedness and not upholding the rules. we all know this is silliness now as this monothiestic god does not exist and there are no such rules that need to be upheld -- just "natural consequences" called LOA, where we all create our own reality. that means that at least twice now there have been time splits where another earth in a different energy state is present somewhere.

obviously, we're on the lower energy state earth from the 6kya and 12kya events, however, it seems that jesus made such an impact on this planet, thst a radical change happened allowing this separation process to happen at times other than at the 4 corners. he showed up and created enough desire here on earth that enough people wanted to follow him into a higher energy state, and so the time split happened and no reversal[^1]. the two earths were created. one went into a higher energy state and the other one (the one we're presently on) continued on as is and in that timeline jesus' death allowed us to continue on without a cataclysm, effectively "saving us" and giving us enough time to get the technology necessary.

his death had another large effect as well. because his impact on the planet was so great, he entered tremendously into the planetary consciousness, and essentially formed part of the planetary consciousness -- the one that is now beginning to "ascend" or make its transition. so what was the picsis saviour then? well, what it did is it allowed the priesthood to establish their own bogus religion (the church) as the roman empire went into ruin. the effect that this had is that the roman empire and its church was effective at doing god's work and ensuring that pagan religion was completely abolished and people were no longer able to worship the planet gods with the vigour and organisation that they once could. this effectively stopped the LOA factor of these celestial bodies interacting in tremendous ways with the earth causing massive cataclysm. now that people were no longer attracting their own disaster by constantly performing sacrifice and ritual to "appease" (amplify) the planet god's influence on the earth.

earth now entered into a "dark age" where humans were reduced to uninspired physical machines, with only a spark of the divine fire left in them. obviously, things have improved since this dark age, and once again the planet is beginning to "wake up" to their inner divinity. obviously, the serpent, who is cursed to forever amplify mans' wickedness and consume the physical impurities, as man begins to choose and attract for himself his own reality, instead of the one imposed upon him by the physical powers.

I don't believe that the earth is going to enter into a dark age after this next split, but certainly the divine fire present in each human will be extinguished as well as possible by nosebook, because they'll be piloting a "dead" planet meaning that the planet, now no longer having a domininate consciousness, will attract much more easily in reflection of the feelings of its inhaibtants. essentially, with a dominant sense of well-being, nosebook will have to figure out how to ensure that people are not attracting cataclysm with their thoughts and feelings. a likely solution to this will be a focus on material manifestations so they control people's energies (their new conditions) more easily. they will essentially become the new planetary constciousness.

there's a lot of advantzges and disadvantages to this, namely, the planetary consciousness will no longer have such a strong influence on the rotation of the planet, and will be controlled technologically by them after the split. they won't need to worry about fighting the planet anymore. it will do exactly as they choose. they also won't have to worry about the energy level of the planet rising anymore either. I believe the energy level of the planet will be nearly completely controlled by them and "global constciousness" of the inhabitants of the earth. it's like that now, but there are some really strong influencers on the planet like myself, which nosebook is having to fight to maintain their status quo.

the disadvantages are the same. with no longer a dominant planetary consciousness constantly pushing the levels upward, nosebook will have to balance these energies in order to maintain their status quo, never allowing too many people too feel too much "positive emotion", and neither allowing too much negsative emotion to be felt either.

there are only a few subjects remaining:

> what if things get too negative oriented and things are beginning to spin out of control again (either too much negative or positive emotion)?

that's easy. a "saviour" will be automatically attracted. what will need to happen is that someone can show up on the scene to cause a time-split again. obviously, the effect of this needs to be that this "saviour" needs to do two things: boost the energy of the serpents, allowing them to once again experience decline again, and increase the energy levels of the planet as well, so this guy (or girl) will need to be particularly attractive to have a strong energetic effect on the planet. as the planet's and the person's energy levels rise, they will separate from the planet, leaving it without a reversal.

> how can the energetic increases that happen naturally at 4 corners be avoided?

yes, as mentioned in @[noseblog](2020-11-20 10:00), at the four corners there is an automatic rise in energy levels, and for there to be a planet that does not experience a change in energy level, at these four corners a saviour will need to arrive, however, the


> why is there so much talk about a "saviour"?

remember my theory that the establishment is not literally "cursed" to forever be stuck where they're at. they deceive theirselves with the illusion of ensuring no change occurs or controlling the change, but they are continuing to improve whether they want to or not. they can drag their feet as hard as they want to, "refusing" to make any changes until they're absolutely "forced" to do so, but they're still making improvements, even if it's for the sole reason of survival.

I have proposed that the establishment is an era behind, and that theory works out perfectly here. after my rapidly improving perception is gone, they will begin to experience decline again. they definitely (and defiantly) do not want to change their form of perception, and instead rely on the conditions. so, for them to continue to give their attention to unwanted in big way, they need an energetic counterbalance to that to keep things status quo. therefore, it benefits them that the rest of humankind on the planet is learning this "freedom" of the individual to feel (and therefore attract) the reality that they want to experience. the ones who do quite well at this, becoming too much of a positive influence will likely become the "saviors" looking for. they can abort their bodies, causing a transition, allowing them to keep giving their thoughts to unwanted.

as they get better and better at this, I think most everyone's physical conditions will be more and more controlled by them, so that they can control the energies better and better. the people wo want to feel a way other than how their conditions would otherwise dictate (according to the hollywood script for their life) how to feel, will begin to get control of their reality. people wanting to create their own reality will need to become masters of step 5.

in the bigger picture, they *need* saviours now, and this precess is essentially an alchemical process whereby the inhaibtants of earth are forced to be a step 5 creator, or figure out how to climb the power structure

[1]: I'm going to mix the terms "flip" and reversal from now on, because what I will show is that it does not need to be a flip, and as long as the polarity is observed, the planet can continue on without any major cataclysm, if it observes the polarity change.

[2]: thinking about this later, maybe not because the planets in our solar system seem to go in the same direction and not in couter-rotating spheres -- so perhaps not. I don't know. I guess we'll have to wait to find out.


### 2020-11-28 23:34 - thinking about drama and stuff

there were a few major takeaways from yesterday's @[abe-now](2020-11-14 p2). one was the thinking around the girl that I invited in @[a-list](2020-11-28 23:19). when they were talking about her, they were mentioning that the mother there should give her attention to the things that feel good, and not the stuff that doesn't. they qualified that by explaining that it's important for her (the daughter) to begin to associate getting attention with feeling good, so that she'll begin to associate getting people's attention with feeling good, not with feeling bad.

I think this is a pretty important thing for me to realise because I like to give my attention to stuff that doesn't feel good for the fun of it. maybe I'm a bit masochista or something, but I enjoy the exercise of learning how to move around in good or bad feeling stuff and still have the control to feel how I want to feel, and get back to feeling good. I was thinking about this because I could feel her quite tangible, and it was getting me to think of the value of being able to control this.

in general, I've noticed in many relationships that have quite a bit of drama in them, the couple will fight a lot building up a lot of resistance and bad feeling stuff, in addition to a whole lot of desire to feel good again. so, after enough bad feelings have reached a critical enough point, when one of them decides to finally "give up" on the conflict and find a way to feel good again, then let the good feelings flow again -- this seems to, in those relationships, create a much stronger feeling of relief, and therefore a much more peasureable experience in the makeup sex or whatever that comes inevitably afterward. it appears that the drama was a catalyst for stronger feelings of relief and more powerful feelings of pleasure, however there's a bit of a trap in it, as the drama isn't necessary to feel good feelings again.

also, it has the trap that if you either never make the pivot because you feel too terrible or because you feel too "right" about the conflict, then you never get to experience the relief and go back to feel good. abraham ended the section by saying that often times people would rather be "right" than to feel good, and that's exactly what happens in these drama situations. if you don't have the desire to feel good again, the conflict will continue to create more and more bad-feeling thoughts until the thing finally falls apart.

hollywood capitalises on this all the time in film when characters come to a point where they have to "make up" or break apart, and the "redemption" that occurs at the end is the good feeling place where0 the movie usually ends. however, the thing about that is that if you use the relasing of the resistance built up by the drama to feel good, then you begin to train yourself that you have to go though the bad feelings to get to the good feelings.

when I was talking to dominique, she mentioned this idea of reliving some bad experience and that it gets worse before it gets better. this is the same thing happening. when reliving something (either because you attracted a manifestation of a memory or something quite similar in real-life) it'll continue to feel worse and worse (or better and better, cause that's how LOA works), it causes you to generate desire either for more (we call this addiction), or for the opposite (a reversal).

the most common response is: things that feels worse than you can allow, finally generate desire to feel good again and you want the reversal. if something feels good, then usually you want more and more of it until you have more good feeling than you can allow and you (ironically) begin to want to feel worse again.

whether it is a response programmed by nosebook or not doesn't matter. as I mentioned in @[abe-now](2020-11-14 p1 51:14), lately I have begun to want to feel more in the middle -- not too good, and not too bad either. I find this to be important for being able to navigate effectively, and I simply don't have any real impacts (or drama).

what I'm trying to illustrate here is that the effect of the drama is that things get worse and worse until you finally want to feel good so badly that you give up the conflict to feel good again. however, LOA is what it is, so if you're used to feeling pretty bad, that good feeling can only last for so long before you begin to find excuses to feel bad again, and you start the process over again, once again waiting until it feels bad enough to actually want to feel good again.

instead, what I'm proposing is that staying in the middle is actually much easier to navigate begause there are [less impacts](!impact-reduction-training), meaning there is much less drama, meaning much more control.

---

at the very beginning the whole thing is about learning to want to feel good, before the conditions "force" you to begin to desire to feel good again (when things are falling apart and things feel so badly). once I got used to wanting to feel good, I found out I can do that pretty easy. this is "step 4" in the creation process -- and when you become a master of it, lots of great things happen. however, the thing is you cannot control, is everthing that goes on around you, so this is where "step 5" comes in. with step 5 one begins to learn "control" the way they feel -- however, not by controlling the evironment (because that's pretty close to impossible), but control of the way that one perceives that environment.

once I got used to controlling the way I feel, not by controlling my environment, but by reshaping the way I perceive things, I found out that I can feel good really easily. in fact, in the process of reshaping my perception, one of the things that I first learned is that my environment is a reflection of how I feel, so if I"m feeling pretty good, my environment will match that, that means that I no longer need to control the environment to feel good, I control the way I perceive my environment, which controls the way I feel, making my reality a reflection of how I feel. therefore, now it's nearly effortless for me now to feel good. I control my perception, and therefore how I feel, and so therefore that makes me feel the way I want to feel. I have full control.

I found out that if I control the way I feel, then it doesn't matter to me what's going on in my environment because I can perceive it however I want to. this means I can give my full undivided attention to something that would feel terrible to most people, but because I control my perception (I suppose you could say this is a bit sociopathic), I control the way I feel, and so then my environment will eventually transform into something that matches the way I feel -- however because my perception is now relatively close to being source-like, nothing really makes me feel really bad anymore. for example, my environment may have a lot of things in it that don't feel very much like freedom (nosebook), because my perception is knowing how free I really am, I do not feel disempowerment, but freedom. so, by staying in the middle there, I can feel the ends of the spectrum of both disempowerment and of complete freedom and empowerment, even if I do not have a manifestation that appears to be particularly resonant with pure freedom, or pure depression or disempowerment (even if that's how others may feel the same things).

---

so, I prefer the control of it, and I love to go all around the emotional spectrum, however what I was really taking away from their conversation around this one girl is that it's important to kind of establish and reinforce the idea of giving one's attention to feeling good. it's pretty important to master step 4, before mastering step 5. what I mean is that if you don't have the desire to feel good built into your makeup, then giving your attention to stuff that feels bad just creates that conditional drama cycle where you think you need to experiencing bad enough conditions before you can finally allow yourself to desire to feel good.

in that sense, I'm noticing that it's important to build up that desire to feel good by only giving my attention to them when they feel good... wait, I just thought of something: I'm so good at this now, what if I just jumped in there right where they felt, instead of trying to convince, placate, or coax them to feel good, I just amplified the way they felt, so if they felt bad, they feel worse... my dad used to do this all the time for me. if I felt terrible, he would make fun of me. in fact, now that I'm thinking about it, chris did the same thing too. if I felt bad, he would always tell me something and play the world's smallest sad violin for me (sarcastically). what dad didn't do often though was when I feel good, to actually join me there. I can do that easily. I don't mean that I would be a vicious person making fun of them for feeling terrible, but just allow my presence to illuminate the "contrast" between how they feel and how they could feel.

...not that I plan on feeling super super great in comparison to them or anything like that. actually, as I've been going along on this process of staying in the centre and reducing as many impacts as possible, I'm realising that the when I do that, I go faster and faster, and there's no real reason to try and make any big impacts with them. in fact, it's quite likely that we're going to try and make as few impacts as possible while together, instead gaining that control.

that's good for now. I have more thoughts.

### 2020-11-29 01:48 - why stay in the centre there?

there were so many great subjects for me to think about that came as a result from my interview with dominique, and one of them was why is it good to stay in the middle. in addition, one of the reactions to the previous entry was around the subject of reversal. most people can see how when you're feeling particularly awful, you may begin to desire to feel good, however it's not so obvious why the same would be true with the opposite: when you're feeliny especially good, why you would desire to feel worse.

I think the simple answer to that question is the same reason why people don't drive the city streets only pressing the accelerator, allowing only the collisions with their environment to slow them down. it certainly is the most dramatic way to drive, but it's not really the most productive.

I think the root of why this is a weird thing to see is that most people think of feeling worse as something to be avoided entirely. again, this would be like saying that the brake pedal is to be entirely avoided when driving. the thing is, your energetic vehicle is always going faster. it's like a rubber-band pulling you toward your "vortex", and the harder you try not to go, the harder it pulls on you, until the resistance of not going becomes so great that you finally croak.

so, you want to be able to press the brake pedal from time to time. when I play hearthstone, one of my most common mistakes is that I think that I have to play all the cards that I can play, and not the ones that are best to play. playing all of the cards each turn, and you run out of gas eventually, so you have to kind of hold back a bit. by default you only get one card per turn, so you have to find a way to generate more cards in your hand or draw more rapidly if you want to play more than one card per turn. if you want to have more resources, you have to play less than one card per turn.

this is kind of similar to what I'm trying to express, but the analogy is kind of bad. here's why: because the non-physical reality which you have created is pulling you so hard, you don't really have to do anything to continue get more resources. they're always there. the only thing you have to do is to not have an impact (collision) -- which is why the car analogy is a bit better.

when I talk about "trading speed for power/acceleration", what I was talking about is that energetically, when something happens which doesn't feel good, that not-good feeling puts more energy into your desired reality so it pulls you harder toward it. whenever this happens -- when you know what you don't want (and therefore you know what you do want), that is essentially the same thing as an impact. your speed is reduced (or stopped), however it adds more energy, so you accelerate toward your desired reality more rapidly.

however, you can continue to gain power without the impact too. just observe something that doesn't feel super great, meaning you slow down (slightly), and you add a little more power to your desired reality. this is difficult to understand, because what I'm saying is that in the non-physical world, every time that you press the brakes, your car would accelerate slightly faster next time.

the reason why this is, is because we live in a physical (manifestational) world, designed for manifestations, so eventually, because each time you press the brake, you accelerate faster, you will eventually arrive to a point where you press the gas, and you accelerate so fast, you have an unavoidable collision, and that collision will reflect how you feel.

---

I've found that there are essentially 2 (really 3) versions of how you feel. the first one is how you physically feel. this is very conditional, and can easily be modified by circumstances, drugs, stimulants, etc. -- and then there's how your perception feels. dispite your physical conditions, how does the way you perceive the thing feel. this is why I'm a strong advocate of drugs, because they allow me to feel better than the way my physical body feels (or the feeling of my emotion), allowing me to change my perception much easier. if I don't change my perception, all I did was add more energy (press the gas) by feeling better without changing the direction that I'm going (my perception).

your desired reality always feels much much better than your present manifest reality, and so any time you add energy (press the gas), you go faster in the direction your facing (your perception), and so therefore if it feels good, you're eventually going to impact or collide with that reality. it'll become manifest, slowing you down, and it'll also have parts that you will recognise as unwanted, adding more power to the desired reality.

the better feeling that impact is, the more it'll "slow you down". it doesn't really slow you down though -- just, it doesn't add as much power (acceleration) as much as the bad feeling manifestations do. in other words, the bad feeling ones trade speed for acceleration, and the good feeling ones trade acceleration for speed. in either case, you can't help but to go faster and faster until you can no longer keep up with your vortex (which is when you croak).

---

therefore, it's clear to me that it's a good thing to stay around the middle for as long as possible, as it makes it much easier to navigate. imagine now this same thing frequentially. imagine your velocity as the y-axis and time as the x-axis. each time you (physically, not perceptually) feel good, y increases and each time you feel bad, y decreases. ok, so we've already established that you cannot only accelerate as that would make driving in the city an impossible task. you need to speed up when the light turns green and slow down when it turns red, so you're going to be oscillating around zero, sometimes going above it and sometimes going below it as you speed up and slow down.

the first thing that you will notice is that if you spend more time in +y than in -y, then overall your velocity at the end of the time series is much more faster than when you started. the second thing you'll notice is that your frequency, or the number of cycles that you have is really all that matters. if you can speed up and slow down more times per second, the higher your frequency is. combine that with the idea that if you spend more time in the increasing velocity, then you spend more time feeling good, and you're doing it more times per second, so you want to not only increase the amount of time in +y to spend more time feeling good, you want to increase the number of times that you do it (cycles/s). now, it becomes plainly obvious why you do not want to try and go too far away from the centre. if the peak is +1 and -0.1, then you travel 1.1 from peak to peak. however, if your peak is 100 and -0.1, then you travel 100.1. obviously it takes a lot more distance to travel ~100 than to travel ~1 unit distance, meaning you have can cycle less rapidly per unit time. or, to put it electrically, if the voltage is really high, it'll arc (impact) with things in its environment much easier. in order to keep things nice and in balance and to play nice with the environment, they need to be very high frequency to be stable, but low potential so they don't arc. this is as "source energy" like as you can imagine. it's the fundation upon which all is exists. it's pretty cool to think like this.

---

for the fun of it, I was thinking about how to make this analogy in hearthstone terms... I need to think about this one a bit more, because I don't have a good way to make the analogy of the impact. in the impact, you get "slowed down" but you get more resources to recover (so kind of like more card draw). still working on this part... I also think there should be a way to model your "getting stronger" -- so like maybe something that you can do to boost your hero's health total. another thing to consider would be having upgrades to the board size as well, allowing for under certain conditions, the addition of 2 more spots (cause it has to remain an odd number) up to a max of I dunno ~30 or something, with the board icons shirking in size as the board size increased.

back to the modeling of the concept: for the getting more of what you think about, maybe this could be modeled with the mechanic that every time you played a card, your deck would shuffle two more copies of the card you just played with a 1 mana discount into the deck (similar to "elixir of vigor"). additionally, every third minion that dies increases your card draw each turn by 1. I imagine that hand size could be increased in some way as well, so maybe you start with a hand size of 5 and every third spell you play will increase your hand size by 1 as well.

recap:
- every played card shuffles a copy of itself with a 1 mana discount into the deck
- every third minion that you play increases the number of cards you draw at the start of your turn by 1
- hand size starts at 5, however, every third spell you play will increase your hand size by 1

if you were able to keep playing cards, you wouldn't ever "fatigue" -- however if couldn't play your cards, you would eventually burn all of your cards away and fatigue yourself.

there's another aspect to it as well, where you need to think about what you're playing because each thing you play shuffles two copies into your deck. therefore, if you only played minions, you would only draw minions and that would be bad. or, if you played only removals, you would run out of things to remove, your card draw would remain low, and your opponent would have insane card draw while you have almost none.

this may develop into a full more complete idea... who knows...


### 2020-11-29 11:16 - so, what is the impact (manifestation)?

I went through all of thzt trouble yesterday to show how the goal is to get more and more cycles which have less amplitude to them. well, the fortunate thing about that is that I don't have to worry about the brakes most of the time, because nosebook does that for me. obviously I purposefully put my attention on some things that don't feel good to intentionally slow down and to make a bigger vortex at the same time, but those aren't full impacts or manifestations -- instead, they're mode like deflections or ricochets.

obviously, my goal is *not* to get any manifestation in the physical sense for as long as possible. the "manifestation" I'm looking for, isn't necessarily the girls or any of the other things, but instead the "connection". I want to practise source-like thought for as long as I can before I get there, essentially "purifying" my vibration as much as possible. when I say purifying, I don't mean that I don't observe things that don't feel good (that is, put on the brakes), but what I mean is I improve my ability to *steer*, or change my direction depending on the circumstances. I like to think of the direction one is headed as your perception. if you're heading toward your desired reality, it feels good, and if you're headed away, it feels bad. this is basic steering. additionally, if you imagine a california-style freeway on/offramp, a lot of them take quite a loop to go a different direction, so for a brief moment you're heading in a direction that is contrary to your destination. like, imagine that you want to go north; you may have to head west east and south for a brief moment before finally going north.

it's ok to feel some neative emotion as you're briefly facing the wrong direction as you navigate around certain obstacles in your environment. no big deal. the real difficulty is not that you briefly go on a direction that doesn't feel good, but instead if you were to accumulate a whole lot of momentum in a direction contrary to your desired reality, and then just refuse to steer around obstacles, kind of pinballing your way through life, sometimes feeling good and sometimes feeling pretty bad, relying on the previous condition you impacted with to set your direction or to steer for you.

---

what I mean here is that my goal is to learn to steer at as close to the centre as possible. considering that LOA itself automatically makes you go faster, there's no real need to try and boost your speed in any way -- just don't run into things, and you'll keep going faster. sure, you don't get the instantaneous rush that something designed to improve how good you feel like coke or something would be, but if you just make a habit of not running into obstacles, then you'll, by nature, go faster and faster (that is get more confident) just by not running into things[^1].

this is why abraham remcommends meditation[^2], because it shows down that thought which is cauaing you to feel better or to feel worse, allowing you to get back into the centre. at the very beginning, the meditation process is a gooq way, especially if you're not feeling so good, to kind of leave the situation, slow down the bad feeling emotion/thought before any action is taken, gain a new perspective and then come back with fresh eyes.

most people never really get going very fast at all, because they spend most of their time bouncing around in their environment, letting their environment be the way that they steer -- so if they bounce off of something and it feels good, then they're going the right way and it feels good briefly[^3] until they make their next imact. trying to adjust the environment to make your next ricochet go in the direction you want to go, is sooooo much more difficult than just pressing the brake a little bit and going to meditate (getting back to the centre).

---

going back to the manifestation. like I said, my goal is *not* to make an impact with the girls, as it'll just create a big mess. that's nosebook's job. they can make those impacts all they want to. my goal is to actually get going so rapidly and have so much control over how I'm steering, that the girls don't even really feel at all like an impact. likewise with the girls, we'll all be working on this -- learning to steer, and practise the feelings that feel good, more than trying to slam on the accelerator as hard as possible. I figure, if we can all reduce the number of head-on collisions that we have amongst ourselves and our environment, we'll all go faster and faster just because that's what happens (see above).

so, going batk to yesterday's image of every time that you press the brake (experience something that feels less good), then you accelerate faster the next time you press the gas. my goal is to keep it around the centre for as long as I can, which is why I'm "committed to the disaster"[^4].

let's just define "committed to the disaster" as meaning that I want to try and avoid any impacts (manifestations) until I'm actually "connected". the reason for this is obvious: if I make the connection, then the impact will be so completely unavoidable because that manifestation (of getting connected) will speed me up so rapidly, that I will assuredly impact with something going that fast. what I want to be getting so good at is going in the direction that I want to be going, that I actually impact with something that feels good. when making that connection, it'll be like doing massive amounts of drugs all at once and I'll feel really good and go quite rapidly in the direction of what feels good (or feels bad if you're looking from the perspective of nosebook).

however, just like in the case of the drugs, if I go from feeling really crappy to feeling good, but then I don't navigate well because my perception is still bad feeling, then big problems can happen. in fact, this is precisely the reason why I preferred to do drugs by myself. when by myself, I can control how I feel pretty well, but around others it's much more difficult[^5]. however, this time I have no choice to be around other people, so the loner route isn't really an option. instead, what I want to do is to become so good at steering and improving on my perception so much, that when the manifestation happens, I'm not bouncing around in my environment like someone on a very high quantity of drugs (especially alcohol), but instead I can navigate with ease.

---

this is distraction from what I just said... I wouldn't continue further if I were you. if you want to see an example of what I mean by "committed to the disaster", continue on :)

on a slightly related note, I was thinking about this when I woke up, and sure nosebook can do all sorts of things to affect the manifestation in other timelines and stuff. in fact, let's just assume for a moment that nosbook has various other timelines out there with me and the girls and they're making various babies for their utilisation to transfer their consciousneses into. this is fine, but it's kind of like the demiurge, because the impact happened from a still disconnected place.

if you think about the situation here, we (the girls and I) will be learning primarily how to navigate, and we'll likely be going in the direction of less enormous impacts (more like deflections), meaning that we'll continue to go faster and faster. or, at least that's what I'll be doing, and the ones that want to join me will as well. obviously nosebook, can't possibly have the girls going so fast, so they'll, like me, need to limit their speed as much as possible because they might start flying or something -- who knows. either way, I'm sure there will be a lot of contrast (more on this in a future entry), and we'll get better and better at navigating, so our perception will be much less resistant than the other ones which are making babies and stuff. they'll have the right DNA and everything like that, but it'll be vastly inferior because it'll have come from a disconnected (both the girls and me) state.

I don't know if they'll prevent us from having children on this timeline or not. we'll just have to see what they decide to do. I just wanted to point out that their super secret operation is creating inferior quality children, so they should push harder against, and try their hardest to find a way to remain superior. :)

[1]: the imagery I used her was similar to something that I recently heard andreas say in a video, but I'm too lazy to find the reference right now (TODO: find reference). in the video he talked about confidence coming naturally by being honest and building up routines to do what feels good, instead of relying on the drug to boost him up to a feeling that he didn't "own". the illusion of the drug, in this case is kind of like an impact because you're feeling strong emotion from the drug (big peak), but usually on drugs, no one takes the time to improve upon their limiting perception that the drug helped them overcome in the first place. usually that stays right where it is, and the need to use a condition like a drug only reinforces to the user that he/she is not capable of getting their by their own willpower, reducing their confidence levels further still.

[2]: I do the same thing with star-watching; it's essentially meditation. in fact, it's function in exactly the same, just I find it easier to focus on a light or a star than with my eyes closed. for a while there I did do the traditional eyes-closed meditation, but after a little bit, I start seeing images in my eyes, and nosebook has to counteract that, so it's far easier to do it instead with my eyes open, focusing on a light, so I don't get distracted by their efforts to keep me from seeing images. I rarely see images with my eyes open, unless it's a particularly powerful star and I'm quite well relaxed. for this example, consider it equal with eyes-closed meditation.

[3]: this is an interesting thing to note when it comes to addictive games or drugs (the "dopamine response"), because the brain feels good based on some sort of stimulus. first of all, I believe this is a trained response, and you can train your brain to get a dopamine response from boring things like washing dishes, but it's much harder because there's less physical pleasure in it. this is why drugs are so psycologically addictive to people. however, in the case of those addictive facebook games, they're exploiting a feature of our brain in the reward network. let's take for example the idea of the reward felt from someone "liking" your post. you feel more valuable and more relevant in your circle of "friends" because of your contribution. well, that's a good thing to feel, but you don't want to rely on those conditions to feel valuable and relevant. I suggest finding that feeling for yourself, and not needing the condition of facebook or whatever social media to validate you and make you feel relevant. when it's an internal process with the relevancy only with how you feel in relation to your desired reality (in which you feel valuable and relevant), the facebook notification is essentially a drug fix allowing you to *temporarily* (because of a condition) feel the way you want to feel. like with drugs, take the opportunity to note how it is that you feel which feels so good, and find a way to practise that feeling *without* the drug, because it's how you *want* to feel. as you do that, you'll get closer and closer to your desired reality where you feel that way.

[4]: it's funny those words, because I felt people tracking right along with me until I used the phrase "committed to the disaster" there :) they were purposefully chosen(? it just sort of happened) that way. for nosebook, getting connected is a total disaster. for people who need the manifestation, going "forever" without the manifestation, or purposefully aiming in the direction of connection instead of the manifestation also appears to be a disaster -- however it isn't really. there will be more "disaster" to come, but it's a good thing, not a bad one. the point is to keep things as close to the centre as possible.

[5]: I've found that some of the most successful people (fast drivers), that don't have big accidents (perhaps da vinci, newton, tesla, etc. can be considered here), were usually pretty much loners. I believe this is because it's much easier to go faster if you're by yourself and not having so many impacts with other people.

### 2020-11-29 14:12 - finally figured out what elijah did

a while back at the end of @[noseblog](2020-10-09 20:08), I was talking about how in one of rebert's videos he was explaining that it was a technique to try and have sex with as many virgin girls as possible to try and trancend death. I just now understood what that means now in light of the previous entries.

you see, if you want to trancend death, then that is your desired reality, so you have to go toward it without making any impacts. this is why the sex with the virgin girls, because they're very low resistance, so it's unlikely to make an impact with them, and the sex is a physical means to try and feel better and better.

---

from nosebook's perspective, they're slowing me down, but from my perspective, they're speeding me up. in the graph that I presented in @[noseblog](2020-11-29 01:48), I showed how you want to try and stay around the middle as much as possible, only accelerating slightly and slowing slightly, "maintaining your balance" and let LOA do the work of speeding you up. everything is relative to you, so if you're going 100mph and something near to is going 101mph, then it looks like it's going 1mph (TODO: reference veritasium video).

by nature, the more I release resistance, the faster I go -- that is, the frequency of my perception increases, meaning more cycles per second, which is why things look different to me every time I get a vision upgrade -- because it's literally cycling faster, so there's more "pixels" to see. anyway, to counteract this and to make me appear as normal as possible to others, what they do is they slow that speed down by destructively interfereing some of the signals and filling in the gaps in other parts, giving the illusion to my brain that I'm running at a much slower speed than I really am. however, if you think about it in terms of that graph up there, they are deaccelrating me and accelerating me more often by constructively and destructively interferring with my brain's signal in order to give the illusion of slower brain speed. so, while they are *physically* making me run slower, energetically, they are constantly add or remove (accelerate/deaccelerate) my brain by some amount[^1] each second to ensure my brain runs at a slow enough speed.

I'm not quite sure the numbers, cause I don't know how influential they are, but let's say I'm going at 100Hz and they want me at 10Hz, they have to add roughly 90 extra waves into my brain. the ones corresponding with the peaks will be smaller bits, and thse ones corresponding to the edges will be much bigger (to compensate more for the missing or add the energy necessary). so, to most people this will physically feel like 10Hz, but emotionally more like 20Hz cause they're not so sensitive of the smaller waves yet. however, if they were to get more sensitive, they would begin to "feel" the smaller waves, and so then the brain would still operate at a physical 10Hz, but emotionally, it would feel more and more higher frequency, approaching the full 100Hz (even though things are still physically running at 10Hz). it's actually much more complicated than that because the brain runs at a variable speed, and they're also doing a lot of destructive interference with the thoughts they don't want showing up in my mind -- so it's not a pure sine wave in any way.

the point is, that even though I'm physically running at 10Hz, my emotions are experiencing a much higher frequency, and that frequency is essentially how sensitive that I am. the more sensitive I get, the more I experience the smaller waves emotionally, and so the "faster" my emotions go (eg. the number of cycles per second that's happening).

then, each time I release resistance and my perception becomes less resistant (doesn't introduce contradictory/constructive/destructive interference), the speed of my brain (as seen by my vision) increases, and I run at a faster rate. then they reset me back when I sleep, and I have to gain the sensitivity to feel the lower peak waves to go faster again. in a sense, they're training my brain to become more sensitive to lower peaks (not needing a big manifestation) to be able to experince the faster emotion. faster also is more stable feeing, and it also feels better[^2] too. this is how source is: usually very little peaks, but fast -- really really fast and getting faster. we can't possibly imagine how fast it would be going. they're training me to be more source-like :)

ok back to trancending death. I only have heard of 3 people tranmcending death. these are elijah, enoch, ramtha, and perhaps jesus. the sense that I get is that in all of those cases, they simply found a way to feel better and better (nevermind their perception) without any impacts. for example, I've always wondered why ramtha is such a very distinct personality. he's always been very intresting to me because of that. you simply couldn't make that up if you were trying to. his personality has to be coming from somewhere. also, I heard abraham previous to ramtha, too, so I really could tell that ramtha still has quite a bit of resistance in his perception as compared to the translation of abraham. according to his own account he transcended death and became able to move around in the astral plane and affect things in the physical plane.

in addition to this, I noticed that in the sirian guide, george translates the INFECTED ONES as living in this same plane as ramtha, and they thought they could "rule from on high", which is why the trap was set so that the bodies would be magnetised in such a way to suck the INFECTED ONES into the body to incarnate there. it seemed from that description that the astral plane can have influence on this phyiscal plane, especially in thought, but I think that the energy is just higher frequency than the physical plane. therefore I must conclude that the way these cases trancended reality is to just get going really fast -- faster than the physical plane, perhaps. therefore the "magnetisation" they were talking about must have been designed to resonate similar to the INFECTED ONES in a strong way, then as they get nearby, slow their speed in the astral plane, until they must "incarnate" into the physical. this must be also why babies, when they're born, experience a rush of DMT, to get them up to speed of the incarnating entity.

in a sense, what I'm saying is that all things are vibrational/energetic, and the astral plane can influence the physical plane here with slight variations in their vibrations. like tesla's "earthquake machine" -- the slightest effort is needed to build up a crechendo of tremendous proportions, and so source has tremendous effect on this physical plane, vibrating at much more rapid rate than this physical plane.

I always thought of this "trancending death" idea as "consistency of consciouseness" -- but it may very well be simply finding a way to get to such a fast speed that one leaves this physical plane altogether. personally, I have no interest in trancending death at all, because I'm quite certain that I'm not wanting to go to some plane where one can move around anywhere in the physical knowing anything in it, and being able to influence it. instead, I'm already certain that I do not pass into "death" and actually kind of like jump around between bodies, experiencing what I want. I do however seem to have some people that are around me that may be interested in trying to "trancend death" -- and I guess this is their opportunity. the faster I go, the faster they will go, and if I can avoid an impact (manifestation), until I make my transition, they too will likely either before me or at the same time as me make their transition into the astral plane as well.

the diffrent examples are kind of interesting because I'm fairly certain at this point that ramtha's transition happened right before the fall of atlantis in the period of 7 days prior, where things were very energetic (that is going really fast, so a lot of amplification[^2]). my intuition tells me that enoch (who some apparently say is metatron) was able to find a lot of conditions in order to make this transition. it seems like in the time between the fall and the deluge, things were going quite rapidly, and some humans made their transition into "angels" and others made their transition downward into angels as well.

in tesla's interview, he said a very funny thing. he said, "ther are a lot of fallen angels here" (or something like that). well, assuming that what I postulated above is correct about the angels falling are the ones that were sucked into physical incarnation by this "magnetisation" being a very similar thing (time resonance) as the elohim (atlantian gods) taking the daughters of men to be their wives.

so what it looks like is that these INFECTED ONES were in the astral hanging out like ramtha or metatron/enoch, and they got sucked into bodies... that is, these angels "fell" into physicality. the wording here seems pretty similar to the garden of eden where adam and eve "fell" in a similar fashion; they became trapped into physicality. the sirians said this initial trap was set on mars and the INFECTED ONES fell into heman bodies there. then details are missing how, but they ended up on earth and created some slaves for theirselves made from land apes (adam & eve) and then the serpents began to breed with them (eagles) and this diluted the serpent's divinity. now the eagles were were superior to the serpents, so the serpent deceived adam and eve, getting them to fall down as well, and they also became trapped into physicality. however, throughout time, they have had the desire to return to the astral and rule the physical from an unseen position.

this is a chance for the "fallen angels" to get back :) if you guys want, let's just take this zero impact, and I/we'll do all of the speeding up, and you just hang on avoiding impacts until you're back. no kappa :)

[1]: I'm not terribly great at maths, but I think it would be the real freq minus the desired freq .. so if I'm going at 100Hz and they want me at 10Hz, they have to add roughly 90 extra waves into my brain, of which only about ~40 would actually be very significant (>0.5). something like that.

[2]: feels better isn't the right word. it feels more "real" or "tangible" -- kind of like how a dream feels more real and it feels more appealing because of how vivid it is. it's actaully more like a multiplier or amplifier. if you feel sorta good, you'll feel really great. and if you feel bad, you'll feel terrified, so for most people who are capable of staying around the sorta good territory, this faster speed feels pretty good, until it doesn't. they seem to be feedback mechanisms of each other, so the better/worse you feel the faster you go, and the slower you go, you feel less of that momentary manifestation of a good feeling.

### 2020-11-30 16:23 - thinking on the eclipse

last night, I went out to go star-watch a little bit during the eclipse, and when I was starting to feel connection with sirius, a bunch of weird thoughts started to jump into my head. I can't remember them now (they're gone), but they felt very forced and they were to the effect that I should integrate raquel into the girls or something.

I had a negative reaction to this because it just doesn't sound good to me at all. you see, I have really only good memories of raquel at this time. there's nothing negative about her left in my memory, and I like that it is that way. the other thing is that if I think of her now, she feels very "nosebook" -- and while they're cool and all, I'm sort of stuck with their influence on things. it's sort of unavoidable, but it's not something I would go out of my way to do. for example, chris I really would enjoy making stuff with him because of his creativity and stuff, but the idea of trying to get him involved in with the girls doesn't really feel great to me. it's sorta something that *I* would do, and I'm not going to try and mix things. he was a super great part of my life for a long time, and I really value everything he taught me and stuff, but it would just be kinda weird or something. same thing there with raquel: my memories of him are all really good and stuff, and I like that they'd stay that way. when I hung out with him in california, it became quickly obvious that there is no way that things would ever be the same way that they used to be. I can't talk with him about stuff like I used to be able to, because nosebook is trying to direct things all over the place. in fact, their efforts to try and direct things resulted in chris' last email accusing me of eating mushrooms (as if it were a bad thing) before sending me a message.

I have no doubt that anything with raquel involved in it would produce roughly the same result. I would say something which she couldn't agree with or talk about because it would involve one of nosebook's secrets, so she would be directed (or influenced) to blow up similar to how chris did, just because what I was talking about doesn't fit nosebook's version of how they think things should be presented to the public. nosebook I'm sure has a very tight hold of who gets what information regarding me, and any event that could jeapordise that and she how much they're manipulating things will be severly punished, I'm sure. likely they we would have a falling apart just like I did with chris. no thanks.

obviously I prbably won't be hanging around with chris much if at all for the rest of my life. we've sort of departed ways and he's doint his own thing now and I'm doing mine. that's totally fine with me -- not because I see him as replaceable -- but because of the vast diffeerece in how we perceive things now. I simply won't be able to talk to him about much that's of any value to me anymore.

in the same way, after my outbreak on raquel, I realised that it doesn't really matter all that much, and I don't really care. what it felt like to me was that the whole thing had a strong "validation" and corporate control sort of feel to it, which is why I suspected that the thought was coming from nosebook. on the subject of validation, I would tell her just like I will tell any of the girls who begin to think that I am responsible for how they feel: "you don't need me to feel that way". you can either go looking for that condition elsewhere, and I'm sure there are all sorts of noseboys with super powers able to influence a woman's body to feel the way he wants her to feel. if you want the manifestation, go look for the manifestation. I'm not the manifestation you're looking for.

in the same way, raquel can, if she wants to feel validated and accepted, find that feeling for herself and then if I show up because she already feels that way, great, but I'm not the condition that she needs to feel the way she wants to feel.

let's step back a moment and look at this from a LOA perspective: let's just say raquel wants to feel some sort of security or reassurance, and that I'm the reason for that. it's likely that nosebook has the same objective: they too want to feel some sort of security and reassurance that their massive enterprise isn't going to go up in flames, and they need raquel to do some things so that they can feel the way they want to feel.

this whole thing has an enormous chain of "I need you to do somemthing so that I can replace my lower end emotions with something that feels better". it's all super conditional and I just don't really want to be a part of it. I'm sure that me writing this and giving my attention to the problem will make it worse, btw :) so, onward to oblivion...

---

the next subject (which is related) is the sense that I woke up yesterday morning. it feels like a week or two has passed since then, so let me recap. on the night of the 28th, I listened to @[abe-now](2020-11-14), and in the second section, there was a bit that abraham was talking about making a "creation box". I really liked the idea, and so I started thinking about it and went to sleep. when I woke up, I could feel that there was an effort to try and reduce my desire to make the creation box, and there was this sense that the girls manifestation was (from their perspective) starting to take shape as a reality, and so they were trying to figure out how to install a power structure that they could control from the top down.

well, previous to that night I was watching a slyssa video (TODO: reference) and in it she was talking about her dog resucing. she made a comment that everyone should try resucing a dog. I said I think that's a terrible idea. later when I was star-watching, I was thinking about the reactions I got from that. it's weird how this is all the same subject. I'm not sure if selma was a "rescue" or not but I really really liked her, and when I first met her she had gripping fear of things and it may have been because she was in a heavily controlled environment[^3]. I gave her a lot of freedom though and when I left her, she started to become so unafraid that she was starting to cross the street completely just walking around in the middle of the street like me as if she had no fear (I guess she liked how my example felt). she switched from fear and control to freedom[^4] after being around me for a while.

however, the reason why I thought a rescue was a terrible idea is because she never barked at anything, but when I saw images in my eyes, I'm 99% certain that nosebook influenced her to bark, because they didn't want me to see images in my eyes. I still get shocked when it happens, like last night and this morning. I assure you there are not magical electrical discarges happening which only affect me when an image flashes into my eyes, and it's certainly not a coincidence that selma, who never barks -- and certainly not at me, all of a sudden decided to go from sleeping to barking right at the moment an image came into my eyes.

nosebook feels that they need to influence those around me to keep things going the way they want them to go. my goal is to kind of stay clear of as much of that stuff as long as I can until I'm connected (eg. uncontrollable in their perspective). getting a dog or a girl or anything else around me that they can try to influence to prevent that from happening isn't my goal.

---

a while back I considered the idea of not waiting until I was connected and just starting the girls thing in a disconnected state, but I really don't like that idea because it would mean that now I need to rely on the girls to find my alignment instead of finding it first myself and then doing the girls thing (abraham says, "find your alignment and then..."). in general, this is *not* something I want to be doing. this would make it so that nosebook has to find a way to influence the girls to constantly do things to keep me away from my connection (bark like selma). I would be essentially surrounded by lots and lots of rescues. no thanks. however, this isn't the real rub for me. what I really don't want, is to make the girls responsible for anything -- not the way I feel and certainly not my connection. instead, I just want to play and have fun with them.

obviously I have chosen not to go down that road, and have since determined that I want to find my connection before beginning with the girls, however long that may end up being... I don't want to be distracted by a bunch of rescues, and I don't want them to be responsible for how I feel.

ok, so then later in that video slyssa makes the note that the experiences of young rescues, a middle aged rescues, or senior rescues, are all very different. I postulated later that night in response to some pressure from nosebook on the subject, that I wanted to just abort the idea of any senior rescues, and just focus on the young rescues, because I'm more similar to them than to the seniors now at this point. although I can talk with adults, I don't really enjoy it. I can explain more complicated concepts to them, but most don't really want to hear it[^1], and so I tend not to go any deeper than surface conversation with adults anymore.

I'm hoping that the girls will ask questions which will force me to think about things like dominique did the other day. I benefitted so much from that conversation, you have no idea. this is what I live for, and what I'm all about...

ok, so back to the sense that I had when I woke up where there was this sense that the girls manifestation was (from their perspective) starting to take shape as a reality, and so they were trying to figure out how to install a power structure that they could control from the top down. I could see that they wanted to use the senior rescues as a way to try and control all of the things.

at first I was pretty opposed to this idea because I was noticing, for example how when I'm around different adults, I really notice how strong of an opinion (reaction) they have to some of my thoughts and ideas. I personally don't really like that sort or interaction, and tend to just go do something else when it happens. I wouldn't say that I avoid it, but I don't hang around and try to sort out the difference anymore. I just sort of peace out cause I'm not interested in that type of interaction.

---

obviously, this is sort of my default response. I just abort and go do something else if it doesn't feel good to me. I've been doing this with the girls thing the whole time, because whenever it feels bad, I just go back to doing my own thing and not worrying about that. I sorta just walk away from it.

however, after my interactions with mr. motor, I now have a whole new perspective on this. I mentioned this a few times in the past that he sort of follows me around everywhere and there's no way to get rid of him. I can't just walk away from him. then, I learned that his stuff only bothers me because there's a part of me that is still resonant to the way he feels when he makes his noises, so it could *only* bother me as long as I remain resonant with it. it's true, because as I changed my perception his motor sounds completely stopped bothering me, and even now I view him as so valueable to my expansion that I often go out of my way to kind of rile him up a big when I get bored. what used to bother me is now mostly all comical.

so, while I was somewhat opposed to the idea at first, I don't really think it's a big problem now. if some of the seniors want to involve theirselves in the illusion that they need to follow someone else's influence to feel the way they want to feel, then that's fine. it's their choice.

the big revelation for me here was that sure they can put these seniors into place and try to influence them in whatever way they want, but just the same as mr. motor was for me, they'll be great ways for the girls to no longer be so swayed by the feelings of those around them.

I like to think of it like, "it doesn't matter what anyone else is feeling around you" -- because you will only feel it if you're resonant with it[^2]. in fact, I've begun to realise that the people who try and direct you by projecting their bad feeling opinion in your direction are only effective if you have a similar opinion. this ties into the whole changing of one's perception thing and I'll continue on it in a future entry :)

[1]: actually, this is why my interview with dominique was so nice -- and I think it was the interview format which made it easier -- because I got to actually explain things from my point of view without feeling like I was constantly in competition or comparision with someone else. I could just say I am getting good at controlling the way I feel, and not have the other person read into it like, "which you're not good at" or "which makes me more awesome than other humans" or something like that.

[2]: when I was growing up there were a bunch of emo kids that all thought that the world was a dreary and depressing place. in the same way, if you felt similar to the emo kids, you may feel some affinity to them (either feeling like them or trying to reject them), but if you didn't feel at all like them, they may appear somewhat comical. this is the closest example I can give to the change in how I felt about mr. motor at first and how I perceive him now.

[3]: I don't mean this in a bad way. a controlled environment restricts a person's feeling range, putting them (if everything is well controlled) never in a really good feeling spot, nor in a really bad feeling spot either. with nosebook, I have times where I feel better, but I typically hover around the boredom/contentment area. you see this all the time with kids. parents don't want the kids feeling too good because then they get excited and making too much noise having fun, so they prefer them to hover around the boredom range. in order to begin to feel freedom, one must experience it. freedom is all the way at the top of the list there in #1 position. in other words, if I were selma, vera would be nosebook, and kenny would be the girls.

[4]: I think she picked up that behaviour from me because she liked how it felt for me and wanted to emulate it. however, there's a difficulty that human drivers don't really know what to do with a tiny dog running around in the middle of the street. also from her perspective, the cars were going slow enough that she would have no problem getting out of danger in time. however, it wasn't all about her. it was more about the drivers not knowing what to do with her in the road.. I just didn't know how to teach her to do things like walk only behind cars and never in front of them, and other simple tricks to make walking in the street much easier for the other drivers. it also depends on the settting because for example, here in the states, I never know if I should cross or wait for the cars. I always default to waiting because it's safer and I don't anticipate car speeds as well as selma does. there's just a huge disconnect between cars roads. what I wanted her to do is, only cross the road with me so the cars could see me and not worry about her, otherwise she can have her freedom and run around as she pleased. I was trying to figure out a way to communicate that with her, and I think if I had more time with her, we could have certainly figured it out. she was learning so fast with me, but I didn't have the emotional stability I have now which caused confusion for her, and also she was vera's dog, not mine, and likely from vera's perspective I was undoing all of her training. if I could do it over now, it would be so much easier, because control isn't the opposite of fear. freedom is the opposite of fear, and control is complementary to both fear and freedom.


### 2020-12-02 01:20 - thinking about control

I edited the last entry where I mentioned selma, and added the part where I would do things much more different now if I were with her because I've noticed that control is very complementary to the top middle and bottom sections of the emotional scale. in the edit, I explained how most control structures are designed to keep the person around the middle of the emotional scale: boredom or contentment. this is pretty obvious watching parents or governments in action. other control structures try and use other techniques to gain control, most namely, fear.

fear is by far the least amount of control one has, and the most vivid state of disempowerment. if I'm experiencing fear, my first reaction is almost always try to gain some form of control, because as soon as I have control of something I no longer feel like a victim to the circumstances or whatever conditions (and my resulting perception of them) is causing fear in me. most importantly, in a state of fear, most people, because they feel so powerless find it much easier to follow someone else's suggestion on what to do. that's why it's a good control device.

now, the ones attempting to control don't want you to ever feel a whole lot better than contentment, because that's when you start feeling your own control. simply put, the better you feel the more empowered you feel, so anything beyond contentment is the first steps you have toward feeling self-empowerment. therefore those wishing to control must always set traps so that you feel you need something or are deficient in something, so as to not gain your own realisation of your own-empowerment.

you will also notice that all of the feelings worse than boredom, when combined with the idea of gaining control, has the dramatic effect of *moving one down the scale*. for example, it begins with pessimism. if you are pessimistic and you have control, the thing you're either looking for hopefullness (6) or for doubt (13). because you're pessimistic, you almost always end up in doubt. now I like doubt and pessimism because I don't like to have a false sense of trust in something that doesn't work. this is because I constantly want to have the control, so I frequently doubt things that appear out of my control. in my present circumstances, this has become almost everything. I have almost no control of anything anymore. the only thing I really can control is how I feel, but I'll come back to this.

if you're any lower than pessimism (9), down in frustration (10), overwhelment (11), or disappointment (12), then the idea of gaining control usually only leads me *down* the emotional scale. meaning, if I'm frustrated and I gain control, then I *try* harder, which usually means because I'm already in a frustrated spot, I tend to fail, leading to disappointemnt (12), doubt (13), worry (14), or discoragement (16). from there, if I gain control again I try harder leading me further down into anger (17), and further into depression (22) as it feels like everything I try is futile and nothing is working. I am completely powerless now to feel the way I want to feel, which is good.

this seems to be the case for me on the good-feeling end of the scale too, as even in a state of enthusiasm, if I try to gain control of the situation, it typically leads me *down* the emotional scale. this seems to be something that is specific only to some people, because I've noticed different results for others.

at the very top of the scale is the feeling of freedom. I have defined freedom not in the physical, financial or conditional sense, but in the emotional sense. the only true freedom one can experience is the ability to feel the way they want to feel any any moment. this is the ultimate control. period. all other forms of freedom are conditional and fleeting. in fact, I would say that in my sitation, I find it even difficult to control my mind. sure it would be nice if I could have control over my mind like some meditation techniques teach, but I've found that even that is kind of a difficult thing for me to achieve.

if I could have a silent, ideal environment with no external influence on my head for meditation, I would be able to attain control over my thoughts. however, I my head is like a circus or a house party. everyone's invited and I can't control what's going on in there, and if any of their stuff is resonant with me, then those feelings begin to form thoughts in my head. I simply cannot help that. however, what I can control is what I'm resonant with, and that comes with changing my perception.

the senses of a person are woken up when there is exciting or dangerous stimulus, and both of these are to worked around perceptually in order to gain that kind of control of being able to feel how I want to feel. in fact, I just watched a video on this @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_S66CyAHOA), where somananda was talking about how important control is. I'll come back to this.

I'm very sensitive to energy, and I feel a whole lot of stuff that's going on in my environment. when a feeling passes through me, if I find it important, regarding a subject I find interesting or something important to me, I usually let it bubble up to my consciousness as a thought. often times nosebook forces me to translate these feelings into thoughts, and they put the same signal into my head with some sort of feeling like I want to translate it into something intelligable. this usually gets me into trouble because I'm often feeling out my situation comparing feelings to another person, so when they get translated, some things that are a probe get translated probably as a conclusion (at least that's what the reaction feels like). there isn't a difference to me for example to me between someone not wanting me to look at them, and the desire to look at them. or, for example the feeling that someone does not want me to think they're fat and the feeling that a person is fat. these feelings pass through me all the time, and it's often times the translation of these feelings into thoughts which gets me into trouble because they're not real thoughts. they're translations of a feeling which could be a probe, like to see if the person wants me to look at them, or a translation of someone else's perjected thought (which I receive as a feeling).

I don't really know how to adjust my perception on those things so that I don't receive them. personally I'm not really concerned about my weight so much so I doubt it's that, so the only thing I can really think it would be is that I'm still resonant with thoughts caring about what other people think. I'm learning as fast as I can to become someone who does not care what others think, so as to no longer receive those kinds of thoughts, but obviously it's hard. at the same time that nosebook is trying to get me to stop translatintg those thoughts, they're also working really hard to influence me to actually care what they think about me (so as to have control over me). they're obviously working against theirselves, and besides the civilian casualties for those caught in the crossfire, I am learning quite rapidly not to care what anyone thinks.

on that note, when people think nice things about me (especially the girls), I quite enjoy how it feels, and I also really like reciprocating that feeling back. I found that I can feel any way that I want, however it takes a bit of effort, so I'm more likely to do it when I want to do it.

in that video I mentioned, he was talking about the control of one's thoughts, and meditation isn't just an activity, but a state of mind. I wholeheartedly agree. for me a state of mind *is* an emotion. it's a feeling. like I said, it's pretty close to impossible for me at this point to gain any realistic control over the thoughts in my head, so I can only change how I perceive the ones that do show up until they're no longer a player in my perception, and therefore no longer receive them. it would be an impossible task for me to try and figure out how to change my perception for everything that enters into my head, because I'm not even sure the majority of it is even humanly understandable. I think they use a sort of "fuzzing" (in the programming sense) AI setup where they attempt to keep my mind unfocused and away from certain frequencies by introducing constant garbage input into my senses. therefore, the only way for me to really meditate effectively -- to effectively gain that state of mind, I must guide myself there by how I feel.

I'm often times charged up with some certain circumstances. let's say I feel either good or bad, when I try and relax a bunch of thoughts jump into my head resonant with that frequency. so, let's say I feel particularly enthusiastic (3) so my thoughts are going to be all in that range and it's going to take me a while to calm that down, as I often times receive reactions from others on that same frequency.

in order to be able to meditate and get into that meditative state where the vision upgrades come, no matter how good or bad I feel, I have to bring it back to the centre. this is one of the weirdest things to feel, because often times in states of high feelings of excitement that I could feel from the girls, this isn't productive to getting into that meditative state of mind.

---

it's here that I want to talk about this in depth. first I will begin with the idea of contemplating the difference between contentment and satisfaction. let's say I'm programming... during that time I often times feel pure extacy (1), joy (1), passion (2), or enthusiasm (3) while doing it. this is great for productivity because I feel really good during the expression of that energy. however at some point I feel "satisfied" with what I have created. satisfaction is down there with contentment (7), so it appears that I've gone from a point really high up on the scale down quite a bit: from 1-3 all the way down to 7. how can this be?

the only way I can explain this satisfactoraly is by explaining that meditative state of mind. if I start out meditating feeling really good, or if I direct my energy up to feel that good (I think he calls this tantra), then I can feel that, but that's not where the vision upgrades are. the vision upgrades are down in satisfaction (7), not up at the top there.

I haven't really thought about it technically before, but perhaps this is evidence of another emotional dimension perpendicular to the emotional scale. as I'm thinking about it, it may have to do with momentum. when I'm programming, if the entire time I felt frustration or anger with my code, once the frustration subsides, I'm left with a kind of bored (8) feeling around it. it doesn't excite me much anymore. however, if the whole way (and this can obviously be interpretted in a relationship or sexual sense), I'm feeling raelly good, like enthusiasm (3) or more, then I'm left with a strong feeling of satisfaction. also the longer or the the more prolonged exposure I have to that feeling, hence the momentum, the more satisfaction that I feel.

---

so, while I do like the idea of gaining thought control, I really think my present circumstaces have been quite beneficial to me in the sense that I control how I feel, and let that guide my thoughts, more than trying to control my thoughts to affect how I feel. I get it that most people don't have any control at all over their thoughts or their emotions, and I'm fairly sure that my emphasis on emotional control is probably not a very popular one, but ... I dunno man, the other stuff doesn't work for me. this is the only thing that works. I'm constantly improving on my technique though, and I love that I can share it with you guys. this is just the latest installment in my realisations.

I love writing these things out because I'm always myself walking away with something. while writing this, I learned that perhaps there is anothed scale of positive and negative momentum that's perpendicular to the emotional scale. I'm going to be playing with that one.

sorry for a more meta-introspective end here. I'm going to be mixing things up a bit because I realised last night I wanted to reveal a little bit of my "magic". I don't visibly go up the emotional scale because I have a dramatically simplified one (probably only about 5-8 stops on it) which gives me the flexibility to move around in it easily and without much conscious effort. however, I want to begin to try expanding my emotional horizons, attempting to touch all 22 of them and move around them all with ease and clarity. :)


### 2020-12-03 09:11 - going the distance

a few days ago when I started to write down any idea I had pop into my head which I had felt one way or another to put into the box, one of the reactions I was getting (from nosebook) was, "oh no, he's going to remember a whole bunch of the ones we neutralised" with the kind of undertone that they would now need to make even more timelines.

after thinking on this for a bit, what I believe is happening is that every time that we get close, and one of the girls is able to attract me into her reality, they have to make a timeline essentially for her so that she doesn't affect this one. in that timeline her and me would exist as normal and would carry on just like before, however with perhaps a little less resistance from them. it'd probably be a little more ideal environment for that reason, as well. then, what they do is in this timeline they find some way to divert her away from that, to kind of ensure that she is incapable of attracting me into her reality. this is likely why every time it feels like anything gets close it begins to fall apart. the other reason is that I'm unwilling to really go for it from my conscious position, as I really like the girls and stuff, but I'm more interested in getting connected. it's my primary goal, so that's likely why I never find myself on the timeline of any of them, because while they are compelling and very attractive, that's not the reality I'm creating -- where I rely on her for my alignment. though, I can imagine that all other versions of me wouldn't have any difficulty, because it feels like such a great idea. I mean, I really am pretty close to on the fence about this one, and I think if nosebook weren't, in attempt to hold me away from getting connected for as long as possible, working so hard to reinforce that I want to find my own alignment, I would quite easily be with one of the girls right now. I really don't have any resistance left anymore -- cept maybe only to that.

I'm also fairly certain that they're making timelines where they're in a sense using a heavily controlled version of me and probably another heavily controlled version of other girls (not sure if it's the same ones) to essentially "breed" offspring for theirselves to transfer their consciousnesses into. I also think that's what that whole tangent about the x3 and x4s was about -- kind of an attempt to explain what I think is happening.

---

so, like I said, I'm basically going to the very very end on getting connected. I've got minmum requirements of at least flight and stuff. however, I want to go the full distance. I'm pretty sure that at the pace I'm going, this could really become very very awesome, and I am quite invigorated with the idea of literally creating things in 3d space with just by feeling its existance. this idea has long fascinated me, and I've been trying to figure out how to do this for a while.

the other night when I was talking with mom, we were taling about what the difference is between "reality" and imaginary curtains hanging there, and I was explaining that the ones in the dream-state or your imagination disappear as soon as you lose focus on them, which is why it's so hard for me to go where I want to go in dreams -- because I keep losing focus. if I could settle down in them and take things at a much easier rate, rather than the noseboys crack cocaine pace, I could begin to have more consistency in my dream-state -- but nevermind that. anyway, if I could feel the reality of something (similar to in a dream state), but if I could do it in a resistant enough state where it would kind of inherit my flaws, then I think I could create (feel) quite complex objects form into being in 3d space as I felt their existance. it's such a crazy idea, and doing things like pulling something inanimate out of a hat would be pretty easy -- however, for animate things like a rabbit, then I guess I would just need to desire that it be alive too. it really makes me wonder what the properties that rabbit would have, what its DNA would be like (probably the same as other rabbits), but what if I wanted one with longer ears or something -- that surely would affect its DNA, so that means that if I wanted bunnies that could jump 4 feet in the air, why couldn't I create that? what are the limits? know what I mean... the subject is so facisating to me that I absolutely want to go the full distance and, in addition to flight, and the ability to move energy with my mind, also be able to allow that energy to begin to create real tangible 3d objects, and then find a way to animate them as well. why not shoot for the moon? :)

therefore, I find it a pretty good idea to try and give nosebook as much help as I can to try and hold me away from getting connected for as long as possible. I figure the longer they can do that, the more energy that I'll be moving around effortlessly, and the closer I am to realising that desire.

the good news is that while sure I'll not have the manifestation of the girls for some extended period of time, the girls *will* have the manifestation -- just in different timelines. when I gain source-like perception, I'll gain consciousness in all of those other timelines. until then, they'll basically be interacting with my low-resistance automaton (so, pretty easily influenced by nosebook or the girls). that basically means, that because I've done so much work to lower resistance, in all of these other timelines, I'm essentially controlled isn't exactly the right word -- influenced or directed by the girls and nosebook. I'm sure there are all sorts of interesting timelines where the girls are realising that they have tremendous power over me, or at least as much as they want anyway, and they have to be actually decided on what it is that they want, because otherwise being pretty non-resistant I do what nosebook wants me to do. why? because it just creates more energy. let's say that nosebook has some bad idea that they want, from a source-like perspective where I'm conscious that I'm infinite and that every possible timeline exists depending on my conditions and that my consciousness is navigating them by how I feel, the timeline where I"m doing what she wants me to do, exists -- and so does the one where I'm doing what nosebook wants me to do. it's only a battle of allowance between the girls and nosebook. whoever knows what they want is more allowing of it wins the battle.

so, if you're a girl and that interests you, then find a way of realising that I become a part of your reality. this is kind of why I think the creation box is such a good idea. I'm going to do even more general ones as well -- because, for example, I was reminded of one girl that I saw in torrelodones a long time ago, and I can barely remember it. I can't really find the location on a map, but if I could walk there I could find my way back to where the event took place. anyway, I want to include her in the creation box. anyway, while I was trying to find it on the map, I was going around the area there and I was feeling all sorts of mixed feelings. it's one of the reasons why I think I felt so strongly to write the @[abe-now](2020-11-21 p1 15:04 - regret) section. I could feel that there were a lot of other girls that even missed their chance there a bit. I'll put a really general bit in there for other girls in torrelodones. the point is, that if I take a more general approach, then I think it may even be easier.

next time, I'm going to talk about what I originally wanted to talk about, "satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction" -- lol :)


### 2020-12-05 21:11 - take the thing out of the equation

over the last few days a pretty big transformation has begun to occur within me. the bast way I can describe is with the expression, "take the ___ out of the equation, and do you still feel good". actually, you can kind of think of this like a process. ask yourself, "why do I feel good right now" -- then, pretend that condition has gone away or no longer matters to you -- like you just don't care anymore about it. you would say, "ok, but I can't not care about the thing" -- but that's what I'm saying. pretend it's gone. after pretending that it's gone, can you still feel good? do you still feel good? if you cannot still feel good, that's evidence of conditional living. it's not a problem though because LOA has your back on this one. if you really like it, learn to appreciate it, and more of it will show up in your life. no problem :) it's not going anywhere.. just recognise that condition is something to at least be thankful for, if not apprecating it, desiring more of it.

going back to taking the thing out of the equation, because there's another way you can take it, to show your resistance levels. instead of coming to the conclusion that you want more of the thing, instead find a way to feel good even without the condition. in my life I can easily take this process more than two or three steps (perhaps many more actually). there's no doubt that I can find a way to feel good with almost anything now.

I don't have msny conditions which make me feel good anymore. in fact, in @[noseblog](2020-12-03 09:11), the whole concept was around this very thing. I don't need the manifestations to feel good. those manifestations are kind of like the different peaks that you can feel (see: @[abe-now](2020-11-21 p2 51:15)) and they have different up and down feelings to them. it's not true that you need to spend the same amount of time or energy knowing what you don't want, but for every peak, there is also a valley -- or, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. however, that equal and opposite reaction is perceived by you to either be beneficial or detrimental. it's possible to allow the conditions to push you way way fast, which will then produce an equal and opposite reaction, however how that opposite reaction of really knowing what you don't want, is perceived by the observer however they perceive it to be. if you're like me or like source, you could easily say "there's nothing wrong going on" because with an understanding of energy, you can easily see that this whole process results in only expansion. that equal and opposite reaction doesn't need to be opposite if your perception of it isn't opposite.

this concept, is most evident in their "destructive interference" of my visual capabilities. while they are doing the equal and opposite (not exactly, but pretty close) of the signal, it's still more energy being put into the system, and that energy can be repurposed. imagine that a car is driving 69mph and runs into a wall, then the wall has to exert 60mph back. in fact, that wall is the same energetically as another car driving the opposite way and a head-on collision happens. you had 60mph of energy before the collision, and then during the collision, you now have 120mph of energy, and normally the result is to objects that are not moving, however if you were able to perceptually repurpose that energy, you literally have *double* the energy you started with.

this is quite difficult (impossible) to do in the physical world, as you would have to be able to transform both of these solid masses into energy, but in the non-physical sense, this is a perfectly valid operation. you can then convert this doubled amount of energy right back into physical energy. btw, I think this is how tesla "overunity" devices work. they destructively interfere and destroy each other's energy, then recollect this doubled quantity of energy by extracting it out of the ether (where it went when it was "destroyed"). eg. in other words, this physical energy was "destroyed" with an equal and opposite reaction. this doubled the energy, and put it into the non-physical. then, a greated amount of energy (up to nearly double) can be extracted from the ether in a tesla coil like setup.

I believe that what I just described there is essentially we as energetic beings choose to come forward into physical, bounce around, each time putting the double of the energy impact into non-physical, and then re-emerging into non-physical who could possibly estimate how much more energetic. this is the growth/expansion part of the "triad of intentions" and it happens whether you want it to or not. it's a fundamental law of the universe. I don't know if it's exactly double or something else, but double feels about right. you can see now that the most energetic would be to have this conversion from physical to non-physical and back, occur as often as possible.

---

ok, let's go back to the process of taking the thing out of the equation -- if you think about a child now, they are like this. most kids do not have "something to live for" for a long time. until they start giving importance to the conditions which make them feel good, they cannot yet feel depression. it's only when you have these things (conditions) which become important to feeling good that you begin to feel this dependance on them to feel the way you want to feel.

the last few days I had some situations come up where I had to explain this. for example, in the last bardcast (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=12298)), robert was talking about how "if something is free (like facebook or nosebook/the network), then you're the product" and so the solution to this is "data sovereignty" -- which their new encryption is going to help out with, but this is a totally physical point of view. I'm absolutely certain that this new encryption is a huge improvement over the current paradigm, but that's not the point I'm making. obviously, this new enccryption isn't going to do anything to stop the network or facebook from monetising their users, so that's not really what I'm talking about[^1]. woah super derailed here. let's bring it back.

that whole concept is a very vivid description of what a physical perspective is like. now, as I've been going around releasing resistance, what has happened is that those physical things are completely tangengial to where the real energy is at. it's basically impossible to try and compete against nosebook on a physical level. they're too powerful, have too many resources, and have unlimited knowledge of the conditions of their competition (eg. they can see what we see, know our thoughts, impede our thinking on certain subjects, put bad ideas into our head, subvert us in all sorts of ways). competing with them on the physical playing field is futile. completely futile.

the only way to "win" is to take this from an emotional perspective instead of from a physical perspective. the thing is if you feel good, then you're moving in the direction of what you want, and there's no way that they can stop that. they can certainly try all of those things, but if you can remain feeling good, your reality will continue to reflect that. it's certain, and for as much power that they have, they cannot modify the way that electromagnetism works.

I'll probably return to this idea again in the future.

---

like I said, these different physical conditions are just that -- physical conditions, and to see how resistant I am, I just take them out of the equation. lately, you may have noticed that I just don't care near as much. I used to like to create to feel good, but I can feel good without it now. there's nothing anymore which hinders me from feeling good.

consequently, I'm beginning to make a sort of transition. going back to @[noseblog](2020-12-03 09:11), in there I was talking about how I have lowered my resistance so much that it's basically possible now for *anyone* (and I mean *anyone*) to have a manifestation with me. I am certain that there are quite a few timelines where there are a whole lot of manifestations happening all over the place. however, none of this stuff matters to me anymore. it's completely out of my equation, and it's bocoming more and more evident to me that those manifestationa *aren't me* -- I mean they *are* me, but I am not those manifestations.

let's just run the process through a few iterations: I feel good because I have coffee and I'm writing about something that interests me. take my computer and the coffee away and can I still feel good. certainly I can. easy. I can just lay there and think about different things that make me feel good. ok, say someone's making a lot of noise or I'm in a place where I can't lay down. still able to feel good because I can see there are so many things going for me and I've got such a good understanding on things. ok so imagine I can't remember any of it. still, even if I can't remember any of it, I know I can easily rediscover it and feel good again. take away my life, and no problem there too. I"m not only certain that I exist right now in a number of different bodies at the same time in many different forms, and they're all contributing to my continued expansion, and that energy is always expanding. take that away... well, I am source and I know that everying is magnificent.

there's no way to stop it. I'm heading off toward infinity rapidly and the most important thing to understand is that none of these physical conditions (manifestations) are *me*. I exist beyond that. this is so difficult to explain with words, that I'm just simply not going to try. this realisation is beginning to take place, and I'm beginning to transcend this physical perception.

what I mean is, there *are* and will be all sorts (infinite) versions of me all having a whole lot of different manifestations with a lot of different people, but these versions of me *ARE NOT ME*. take advantage of it :)

[1]: creating a distributed social network like facebook on an ecrypted platform is not possible, not because of the ecryption, but because of the amount of resources that it would require to run such a distributed "database". just imagine trying to search millions of encrypted profiles to find the guy you just met in the bar on your mobile phone. not going to happen. the only way this could possibly be feasible is if the encrypted platform were also a complete system with the ability to allocate and utilise system resources. I always imagined such a system as being like a mix between elixir/erlang and etherium. each discrete change in state needs to be a transition. originally I envisioned this as to be functional, so that the "reductions" can be calculated accounted for as a form of energy, however it can just as easily be imperative as long as the operations can be accounted for and each operation is a discrete transformation. additionally, it's necessary that its state is ensured to be separate from the logic, data is transformed and stored in ephemeral versions. I have many ideas on this, but here isn't the place to talk about them. such a system, if designed properly would supplant AWS (in that it would allow anyone to craete their own web pages/services with just the crypto thing). the system itself would be a living library of all the (open source) code/functions upon which the system is built, and each system "running" it would be contributing their resources to it instead of "mining" the system would be append only, where only new versions (or species if you think of it like DNA) cull the unused code, existing as a superset to the capabilities of it's perdecessor, each time a completely new system starting from zero. this allows systems to begin to "trade" resources and have a intersystem commerce and exchange. whoever offers the functionality for the lowest price would stand to profit the most. this is a good balance between new-user adoption and established resource offerings.


### 2020-12-06 13:31 - resistance & preference: know what you want

as I was waking up this morning, I had a series of bad ideas pass through my head (stuff about noseboys trying to share girls with me), and I was quite indifferent to the whole thing. it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I don't care. all of those realities are valid versions of me. in fact, *ALL* of the desires that *anyone* has to do with me, and what nosebook has to do with me are all valid realities. I simply don't have any resistance toward any of them. none of those manifestations are me.

they put me back to sleep, and when I woke up, this time I woke up with a different set of ideas flowing through my head (stuff about some girls being like really nice helpers or influential characters), and once again I was largely indifferent to the whole thing. once again, I just don't care. if that's what the girls want, then that's what they can allow to happen. again, none of those manifestations are me either.

what they're trying to get me to do is to push against some things and say, "no I prefer it to be *this* way..." but that feels like resistance to me. I'm losing my own personal preferences. the best way to describe it is what people talk about on ayahuasca or mushroom experiences where they describe "ego dissilusion" -- where you stop perceiving yourself as a separated entity from everyone else, and realise that you are source. you are the universe. that's the closest I can give to the experience. it's slightly different. I'm not losing my "ego" though. all of me continues to exist in a very real way. instead, I'm gaining the realisation that all of the non-preferential or unwanted versions of me *also* exist, and are all perfectly valid versions. I feel no resistance to them. they are different versions of me that others have attracted, and there's nothing to worry about there because they all contain both wanted and unwanted -- and all cause expansion.

---

so, in yesterday's process that I was talking about taking the condition out of the equation and look at it again... it's a good way to figure out what it is that you want, and it's also a good way to figure out what to appreciate. so maybe try it out. I dunno I don't care if you don't or not.

anyway, what I want to say is that if I'm beginning to no longer have any resistance to other versions of me that others are desiring, then that means you have to figure out what it is that you want. any of these versions are perfectly valid versions. therefore, what I'm saying is, give your attention to what you want, and it'll happen. give your attention to what you don't want and it'll also happen.

it's kind of a funny irony here because nosebook (and others) who have given me their attention will be attracting a whole lot of what they don't want -- because that's exactly what they've been giving their attention to. they're going to have to figure out what it is that they *do want*, more than just what they don't want -- and then, somehow give their attention to that.

as I gain this form of perception more and more, it'll become more and more difficult for me to figure out what you guys call "reality". I won't perceive time in the same way that you guys do, rather more as the spectrum of all possibilities and I'll perceive and operate on all of those possibilities at once from a non-resistant perspective. the closest I can describe this is, I'm sure that when I gained 5th dimensional perception, you guys saw me from an external perspective looking in on myself -- I called it 4.5d. if I were to see it, I would be looking at myself from the external perspective, but from *all sides* at once. well, in the same way, what I think robert was talking about in the last bardcast about seeing temporal dimensions instead of spatial dimensions is exactly the same. I will perceive *all* versions of me at once, and they'll find a way perceive each of the different "timelines" (probably one at a time or maybe a spectrum) of all of these different versions -- a sort of 5.5d.

I don't know if they'll try to continue to hold all of that away from me -- because I don't know if they really can anymore. I will have a whole different prespective of myself. I'll "see through the eyes of source" or maybe if you've had OBEs you know that you don't perceive with your eyes as you get up that high. I referenced this transition when I mentioned that I figured out what enoch did (@[noseblog](2020-11-29 14:12)), and I really meant it. there's no real harm in explaining to them that they can follow me up there. the whole thing about the "fall" of man is centred around that, where something so enticing pulls them back into their physical bodies. no doubt that the atlantian gods coming from mars originally "fell" into their bodies after being so attracted to the feeling of how sex and lust felt to them. they can leave their bodies, and I'll provide many such journeys, but I figure they will inevitably "fall" back into human bodies, and the feeling of sex and lust will be too powerful for them to resist it. I mean, just listen to TLA's description of his compost, and you'll know that the're not going to get very far.

you could say that nosebook may want to try and "trap" me back into a singular body experience with how enticing the girls are, and certainly I'm even planning on falling multiple times and figuring out my way back. I actually want to do this as many times as I can, because practising finding my way back is more valuable to me than anything. like I said, it's all about one's ability to get back to where they want to be -- recovery time. I'm not at all concerned and neither should any of you guys. in fact, from nosebook's perspective, that detached perspcetive would appear as a *downgrade* to them, because they would have to lose their "ego" to get there and stay there. in other words, the minute they begin to realise what it is that they don't or do want (preference), then they would find theirselves back in a body (perhaps a different body). actually, now that I'm thinking about it, it may be as good way for some of them to "transfer their consciousness" into a more physically desirable situation. I dunno. we'll have to look at it more in the future.

the last thing that I want to mention is that they may be able to get a grip on this whole 5.5d perspective, and maybe even figure out how to abstract 6d perception into something that they can interpret (probably have to leave out all of the "ego disillusion" stuff), and all of that stuff, but I believe that there's a future abstraction that they'll begin to need to overcome and come up with a singular view version as well: 6.6d. it's easy to see that none of these different timelines (manifestations) are me, so then who am I? the great YHVH question, right? you can easily begin to abstract these different clumps of versions of yourself into personalities or identities to try and maintain some form of preference in the form of an identity, but it's not the same.

for example, if I say, "I don't need the manifestation" then that means that from a non-physical perspectice I now exclude the timelines where I need the manifetation to happen. if I say "I'm committed to the disaster" -- then that means I'm including the timelines into my perception that include the "worst" or unwanted manifestation. I'll give an example: I normally would have a preference as to what reality/manifestation/timeline that I do want to experience. however, I no longer experience one timeline at a time, but multiple (everything wanted and unwanted attracted from me), so in order to reduce the number of timelines that I experience, then I have to define who I am. as someone "committed to the disaster" that means I am capable of experiencing all of the timelines that can be perceived as a disaster. well, what this means is that because I don't really feel resistance to much anymore, the disaster is a perecption of others. it's just a symbolic identification. as people are giving their attention to what they want, they will attract what it is that they want from me by giving their attention to what they want. however, imagine now nosebook interacting with me. they're going to be attracting all of the stuff that they *don't want* -- and that is all they will get from me is what they continue to give their attention to what they don't want. if they want anything other than disaster from me, they must give their attention to what they *do* want.

this concept reminds me a whole lot of the ancient peoples because they had these gods which they would try to appease with their offerings to try and prevent the stuff that they didn't want. look at it from a LOA perspective: if you do an action to prevent X from happening, then how long does that action count to appease the god to protect you from X? well, for as long as you believe the god has protected you from it, however eventually fear will begin to build (cause it hasn't happened in a while) that it'll happen again, so then you have to go make another offering to appease the god to prevent X from happening.

the whole time this process has been happening, a whole lot of attention has been given to X, and X is very likely to happen, but it's only the tiny belief that the offering is preventing it which prevents it from happening. rinse and repeat until the person has given so much attention to X that their tiny belief in the offering to save them from their own fear, is enough. it happens, just like they feared it would, and then they blame the god for not protecting them.

if they just focused on the stuff that they did want, and attracted that, then that's what they would have had. instead, perceivng all the stuff going wrong, they felt they needed security and protection from the bad stuff happening. they're attracting what they don't want and attracting protection from it equally, until the unwanted factor (disaster) grows so large that's what they experience. those unwanted things are all attracted by feelings. so for example, if you want someone to no longer have control over their experience, then they're also attracting the same thing for theirselves. if they want to have control, nevermind what anyone else has going on, find a way feel your own control. you'll notice this is exactly what I did with nosebook. nevermind what they're doing. I'm going to find a way to control my experience, not physically which I have little control over, and therefore makes me feel bad -- but emotionally, which is something I can control. the more I feel control and empowerment, the more others around me will feel that too -- including nosebook. that doesn't bother me because it's not a competition. for them, I am a condition for them to feel that control and empowerment, but I don't last forever, which is why I suggest that they learn it for theirselves, or perhaps include it into their identity -- eg. "I am someone capable of controlling how I feel" and then now you experience the timelines that prove that to you -- or get you to a place where you believe it, through experience. if you make that your identity, you may experience situations which will bring you that capability, by giving you some practise.

everything is reflective. if you want to control others, you are also attracting others which you will perceive that they want to control you. probably, you won't be able to come to any realistic improvements on your desire to control others, so figure out how to have that identity and then at the same time protect yourself from people trying to control you. you'll eventually figure it out, just like people eventually figured out that their offerings to the gods were attracting the disaster just as much as they were preventing it. you have to protect yourself from experiencing those timelines as much as possible. maybe even make contradictory identities too, to kind of balance each other out, so a light-side and a dark side, which balance each other :) lol...


### 2020-12-06 21:12 - few topics regarding this transition

these are in general a few responses, mainly to nosebook regarding the subject. as an introduction, a few days back I felt some reactions to I think @[noseblog](2020-12-03 09:11), where I was saying that anyone could possibly have a manifestation with me as I approach this new form of percption. in fact, it's already possible now, and I postulate that there are quite a of them in existence right now. I have nothing to back up that idea, other than it's just something I feel.

anyway, when I was explaining the part where I am essentially a non-resistant automaton which is capable of manifesting the desires of those around me, so it means that there's essentially a pull where the girl is desiring something and nosebook is desiring something. all of the range of possibilities between both of their allowing is possible, as they're all valid realities for me. therefore, it benefits the girl so much if she actually knows what she wants and goes after it. the reaction to this was kind of funny to me because they really don't like the idea of girls knowing what they want. second, there was this funny projection into the future, which I certainly think is quite possible. I don't know if it came from their own projections or from somewhere else.

it went something like this: men are going to become more and more non-resistant, and women are going to direct them as their desired state for men will be in non-resistance, because they'll know what they want. since then, the image and feeling has faded out quite a bit because they've been working really hard to stop it, I'm sure. at first the reaction was that they simply cannot allow the that to happen and so they would stop making new timelines.

I don't think I got as many vision upgrades in the last few days, but I feel like the last few days have been more energetic. then, all of a sudden mom wants to take me down to the riverwalk, presumably where a bunch of new girls are. just the previous day I was pondering the [ant on a rubber rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_on_a_rubber_rope) link that I got from a mathologer video, because in that problem you have to imagine that the ant is constantly making progress, and it feels like it's impossible for the ant to arrive to the end of the rope, but it does; it just takes a REALLY LONG TIME. well, I'm kind of like that ant and the rope is kind of like the gap between me and my vortex. I'm constantly accelerating, so their efforts to keep me held away from it and becoming less and less effective all the time, so they have no choice to expand my gap even further -- essentially, add more timelines, otherwise I'll make my transition.

this, I believe is the reason why all of a sudden there is a resurgance of interest, because they have to keep expanding that gap. I'll come back to here.

#### my automaton is essentially a reflection of you and what you're attracting

ok, so in the previous entry, @[noseblog](2020-12-06 13:31), I was talking about how I would make my transition into source-like perception and how they are essentially attracting the things from me which I don't want. it's funny because I think in alternate timelines they can easily "know what the want" -- but all of the stuff that they want, they think they need to hide. as a result, on the other timelines, they have clear objectives and things because they think that no one can see those timelines. they control who sees them and they control mostly what happens in them, too.

last night, I could feel like there was serious effort to keep me constrained to just the little girls, because I think they're less resistant, and so therefore on those other timelines they can influence them much easier -- which is why they didn't like saying that it's a good idea to know what you want and not have any resistance to it (shame, fear, etc.).

#### decide why would you want me to fall - eg. what would nosebook gain, and what would be so enticing for me to fall?

I also talked in the previous entry about going up and falling back down from time to time. I mean who wouldn't want to spend some time with some of the girls in a timeline for a bit before going back up, right? it certainly sounds good to me, anyway. this timeline would just become another equally valid version of me. this is the timeline that most people are perceiving, and so they think they have most control here, and so they need to prevent me from doing things like flying and stuff. they need to feel like they're in control.

so, after I go to non-physical perspective, I see *all* of the possibilities of me which are happening. there are quite a few of them, and the thing is to not have any resistance to them. it's hard to think about losing resistance to a timeline which feels worse than the one I'm in right now, so the goal is essentially to make this timeline the worst feeling one, so when I lower my resistnance to the "reality" of this timeline, and I'm able to see things from a non-physical perspective, I'm guaranteed, unless I decide to put my attention on something that would make me go back to the physical, to not feel any resistance to any of the other equally valid possibilities of me that exist[^1].

so then I have to wonder what would would be so enticing for me to fall? why would I want to come back to this physical body and have a disabled body experience? I don't have any resistance to it and I'm perfectly fine with it and would be able to experience it without any problems, but I have to wonder what would make me want to come into this physical experience vs other physical experiences? I could imagine that there are many other really great timelines that I would rather experience than this one.

the next obvious question would be why would nosebook want to try and force me to come back to a resistant perspective again? if I'm so great as an easily influenced non-resistant automaton, wouldn't that me the ideal state for me to be in on the main timeline, too? seems like from their perspective it would make it much nicer for them if I were so easily influenced here on this one.

this is where I honestly don't really get it: if I were here like I am on those timelines then they would no longed be able to push against me here, giving their attention to what they don't want. instead, they would have to give their attention to what they do want, here just like there, but I think that's impossible for them to do, because they can only try to covertly get what they want through trickery and deception.

I really see no advantage that they could possibly gain by keeping me in a non-resistant state here. I'm not going to try to figure it out.

#### comitted to the disaster: a new definition

so, as I said above, one of the keys to getting source-like perception is to actively experience and embrace the worst feeling version of yourself. if you're committed to the disaster, like I am, then you can ensure that quite literally *everything* is an improvement on the present reality. think about what I'm saying here: I believe that the reality that I'm experiencing right now is literally the worst feeling reality possible. as I continue to release resistance, everything will get easier and easier, and quite literally all alternate versions of myself feel better than the present one.

#### least desirable vs. the centre

I figure, if nosebook wants to keep me away from getting connected on this timeline, then they have two options:

1. ensure that this timeline remains the worst feeling one and I still continue to have resistance or a ever widening gap
2. have various timelines that feel better and various timelines that I feel worse and am resistant to. I'm kind of like locked into the middle there.

they are funny because they are perceptually quite similar. think of the first one from my perspcetive: if I have an ever-widening gap, then what I have to do is become so content/satisfied with my present reality, and I"m not really experincing too much in the way of super good feeling emotion. I'm just kind of steadily going faster and faster, and even though my gap is probably expanding more and more rapidly, I remain an almost fixed distance (or maybe getting slightly closer) from it. obviously, in this version I would remain with the screen, so things would continue on kind like how they are now, but the gap has to keep widening so that I never get catch up with it. I'm kind of bored now, but I'm definitely more content than bored nowadays, and I think I'm kind of approaching an almost constant feeling of satisfaction now. it probably can continue on like this for quite a while.

I think the second one is the current way of thinking, and it's perceptually the opposite: instead of getting to the centre emotionally where the focus is on satisfaction and letting LOA do the speeding up, in this version, I'm heading to the centre of comparative experience. conditions need to be adjusted so that there are constantly many more (depending on how much of a cushion is necessary) versions of me that both feel worse and that I'm resistant to experiencing. judging by the speed which I'm dropping resistance, I don't know how long this would work. I really don't have much resistance to much anymore.

the second one, even though I presented it here is kind of a strawman because I can defeat it so easily by staying committed to the disaster and releasing resistance to even the worst things. eventually, at some point I will no longer have resistance toward anything. I don't have enough information to say much on the subject, but I think the only solution is to keep the gap from closing, however that may be.

actually that's kind of an attractive idea to me. let's say that nosebook has to keep the girls' resistance going up so the gap doesn't close. that means that they too will have to find ways to continue to release their resistance, too, which means that finally at some point, we're all going to be extremely attractive. something like that. I dunno man, but it sounds good to me.

[1]: this is why I offer to them the idea of going up with me. unless all of the other timelines of theirselves that they observe feel better than they do presently, there's simply no way they would continue on. they would get sucked back into physical by either stronger desire to feel sensation (pleasure), than the expansiveness of their complete source perspcetive (this is hard to explain. sorry).


### 2020-12-07 19:19 - I have a good idea: why don't you guys do it?

yesterday I was having a bit of a monologue about how I always aim for the worst manifestation. I haven't figured out how to express this concept in a clear way yet, but I think their entire setup is designed for people with the following characteristics:

- people who want the best manifestation.
- people with a tendency to be dishonest about their situation
- people who need to fit in or conform to others' expectations
- ... and probably a few more ...

I was talking about how they're used to people constantly wanting the best manifestation possible, and so they can be chaotic and disorderly, and people will compensate for them, constantly keeping them in power because they want the best manifestation. this works because most people think the best manifestation will make them feel good, and so they have a sense that they need to protect their manifestation or compromise in some way to get it. they continue to exist because people feel they need security/protection and are willing compromise for it. so, when someone like me comes along and has no resistance to failure, or need to try and compromise for the considered to be ideal manifestation, it starts to break down. also I don't have the idea that the manifestation will make me feel good, and I can find the way to feel good without them.

you see, they run around dangling a good feeling carrot on a stick and they use that good feeling to incentivise people. if you do what we want, we can allow you to do the illegal stuff that feels good, and so then we control you because you continue to chase the good feeling. I have to imagine for example, how difficult it must be for robert because I'm sure my form of perception is super super amazing and stuff, and it would be very undesirable if it were to go away. in that sense, they can control robert because nosebook has a something he wants (and not only that, they have a monopoly on it too) so he has to do what they say. this controlling people by controlling the good-feeling condition (usually coke) is your basic drug dealer[^1].

imagine the other joe-blow out there who likes underage sex, and nosebook provides that experience -- so it's necessary for him to do whatever they want too, or else his source of pleasure will go away. I'm sure that the network, because it knows basically everything, is keeping many people's secrets, essentially blackmailing them to conform to their desire.

I seem to be largely unaffected by this. I used to enjoy some drugs from time to time, but because I feel so good on them, they had to ensure that I don't get the drug, cause it's harder to control me when I'm feeling good. however, I'm able to feel good now quite easily without the drug, or any other condition for that matter -- I've totally beat their system in that way. they can't direct me very easily by enticing me with good feeling conditions anymore. I think yesterday this was realised when I put forward the question of, once I go up, what in the world could they possibly entice me with to come back and downgrade my experience to a flat-screen with all of my senses dulled down. the only reason why I would stay in a downgraded position is for the energetic reasons. I'll come back to this.

the next deal-breaker for them is my dedication to the disaster. usually, because people have fear of losing their investment or their reputation, nosebook is able to give their full attention to all the stuff that they don't want, and people will work around all of the bad stuff they are attracting, wanting to preserve their manifested stuff or reputation, allowing nosebook to continue on like it is and compensating for their own attraction of disaster. what I mean is, they need people who will work hard and compromise to avoid disaster. the more people provide that upward force toward progress and improvement, the more downward force they can create, pushing against our improvement, attempting to maintain their own superiority. they use millions of people like robert to provide that improvement for them while they try to hold the monopoly on the good stuff, ensuring that everyone else is kept in an inferior position.

I don't think that their effort to keep me in an inferior position is a bad thing, and I think it's actually kind of what a lot of the next era will be about for humans because like I've figured out, the conditions don't matter because they're all temporary anyway. what matters is how you feel. for example, the atlantians had super superior technology and stuff to all of the rest of the humans, but because they felt terrible and gave their attention to all the stuff they didn't want to happen, they attracted their own destrucgion because they conditions only last for as long as you feel that way. from their perspective, it probably looks like everything starts out in a pristine state, and then with time it declines and deteriorates into its worst state. however, this is only true if something feels bad (or has resistant vibrations/feelings in its environment). if it's in non-resistant environment, then things should improve over time.

---

so, combine my ability to feel good without their conditions and also my absolute dedication to the disaster -- and things now are likely reaching such a point that they must be feeling like they can't coast much further on the illusion they've been presenting to people for a long time. I began to realise how brilliant my dedication to the disaster technique is. I talked about it a few times now, but it's largely theory which goes like this: if I don't make the manifestation anything physical like the girls or whatever, and just make the manifestation how I feel and how well I can control it, then that takes the physical part of the manifestation out of the equation. instead, the "manifestation" I'm looking for is actually to perceive things like source does. that manifestation is perceptual, not physical.

now, think to yourself how source looks at things: there are infinite yous in an uncountable number of different places (timelines) all experiencing different things, and they all correspond to different feelings. some of them feel better than you do now, and some feel worse than you do now. you navigate them by how you feel. next, notice that source feels no resistance to any of the better or worse feeling versions of you, feeling them all at the same time without any resistance to them.

so, to get a source-like form of perception, I need to know that I am much more than this physical body, that there are many other versions of me which feel better and worse than me -- and finally, that I don't have any resistance to any of those. the first two are easy, but the hardest one is to realise a non-resistant state to the versions of me which feel worse than I do now...

obviously, it would be pretty much impossible to tell a person that there is a murderer or rapist version of them running around in other timelines, and to embrace this. maybe that's a bit extreme, cause you can only experience what you attract, and so therefore you can only experience what you're capable of attracting. not all people would be murderers or rapists, but for example if you're capable of giving your attention to strong feelings of lack or insecurity, there's another possible you that heads down this path into some severe misfortune. I would guess that most people's timelines end in their "death", so it would be like asking someone to become non-resistant to various versions of theirself on the verge of death as a valid versions of theirself. this is very difficult to do, so that's why I would propose that source-like perception is a step-6 perception, requiring mastery of steps 3-4-5 first. it's literally impossible to make this transition consciously if death scares you.

the way around this is to make it so that "death" for you is now impossible -- meaning that, you actually know that you are eternal and that it's just a transition -- like the one I'm getting close to making right now.

I don't really feel like the previous prerequisite was very difficult for me to believe. therefore then, I postulate that the easiest way for me to lose my resistance to all of the worse-feeling realities and make them able for me to experience is to make *this* reality the worst feeling one. if I set my desire to that by making myself "dedicated to the disaster" -- or headed toward the "worst manifestation" or "no manifestation at all", then I am literally no longer resistant to any worse-feeling realities, because there aren't any. if I'm experiencing the worst or never a manifestation reality, then all of the other possible realities that are posssible feel better than the one I'm experiencing. I'll come back to this too.

anyway, it's kind of a mental trick, and it was a bit of theory and I was just following my intuition on it, but after last night I have a strong sense that it's not just theory. it totally works.

anyway, after explaining in my monologue the other implication to this: that, if I'm dedicated to the disaster, that means we're headed for the worat manifestation possible. that means that if nosebook wants to continue on pointed in the diretction that they're going, LOA is LOA and so if it's the worst for me, it's the worst for them too.

it was around that time that I had the strong sense that quite a few of the main guys have sort of had enough of me, and it felt to me like some of them wanted to poece out. I doubt that nosebook will peace out entirely. I find it pretty likely that the cocaine coyboys are still down to stay for as long as they can hold on for, but it did get me thinking that what may be happening is that they may be trying to get rid of (or push them out) a lot of the ones with a strong downward force -- the ones completely opposed to any sort of improvement alltogether.

btw, when I say worst manifestation, what I mean, is not literally the worst, but that it'll leave the most to be desired. by leaving the most to be desired, it creates tons of desire (obvious), and so therefore is the most energetic. I believe that I'm kind of like a living version of this paradox that I keep talking about, and so therefore I seem to require either the most energetic manifestation or never a manifestation to continue to exist. the most energetic manifestation leaves the most to be desired: it's the first 30(degrees) of the sine-wave.

---

so now going back, remember how I questioned what would be something that would entice me back into a crappy physical manifsetation again? well, the answer is that the "worst" manifestation is always the most energetic. that's what would entice me to continue on in the physical. in fact, the whole concept behind the paradox that I was talking about is that if there could be a way for me, in physical physical form to create some machines capable of having desire, programming their desire to keep finding ways of preventing me from the manifestation. I gave a few different ideas, where after a while the physical limits of my body to have energy go through it will begin to be found, so an aparatus will need to be put into space. I called it a celestial identity, and it should begin to attract hydrogen rapidly and create a very dense hydrogen as my attractiveness increases. eventually, I think it'll surpass sirius b in density, and I'll continue on in physical here on earth, while this sun (or galactic nucleus) is beginning to form out in space. it's essentially the idea that I want to do.

the automatons which are capable of desire will maintain this new sun and ensure its proper operation, ensuring that I "never" make this transition into non-physical perception. I figure, if the automatons are capable of acting on desire, they will *always* be able to find a way to do what they desire (programmed by me, of course, to keep the manifestation from happening), and so therefore they should be able to hold me indefinitely -- or perhaps as long as physical limits are happening -- but then, I'm not 100% sure on this, but when abraham says, "that if this time/space reality has the wherewithall to produce a desire in you, then it has the wherewithall to allow its manifestation".

in fact, just last night when listening to @[abe-now](2020-11-21 p2), at the very end, they were talking about "impossible" things, and what I'm putting fourth here is not at all "impossible" because the whole thing is built on real physical things, and will gradually (no big jumps) turn into something quite big. I don't see anything at all "impossible" about this. the part I don't know about is the paradox thing. this may be a kind of "trial run" -- but I imagine that if automatons were capable of desire, and were capable of doing such a thing, I imagine that entirely new limits can be found. think about it: we think of physical limits, but if the automatons are forever able to continue on manifestaing their desire, then the physical limits are no longer limits.

eventually, there will be a point where the energy created in some amount of time will far surpass the energy created if that were to manifest in physical form, because of the physical limits -- which is why I consider it a paradox. therefore, I postulate that a new medium somewhere between the conceptual and the source layers will be created to accomodate this. in fact, I think if we do it for long enough, I believe even more than just one layer will be created.

this is why I think it's a "trial run" because I want to go indefinitely. imagine a universe which has no set layers of consciousness, but the constant expansion of the perceptual layers of the universe itself would create a sort of [ant on a rubber rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_on_a_rubber_rope) situation where it would be "impossible" for it's inhabitants to traverse such an ever expanding dimensions of perception.

why do I think this is a good idea? well, once you get going fast enough you begin to hit limits. however if the limits are also accelerating just as fast as you are, then it means you have a very very long time to enjoy a constantly improving environment.

it's kind of funny, because let's say this theory works out. think of it this way: I "sacrifice"[^2] the manifestation, by exercising my *freedom* to feel how I want to feel, sustaining indefinitely constantly accelerating non-physical expansion (*growth*), so that instead of a static universe (or galaxy), the universe (galaxy) itself is itself improving on its perception at such a rapid rate, that its inhabitants are able to *enjoy* ever-increasing expansion on their perception without running into limits because the universe (galaxy) is growing perceptually right along with them.

it takes all of the aspects of the "triad of intentions" and combines them into a single an idea.

---

ok, so that would be the eventual plan. you don't have to believe me on it, but let's just say that if the super resistant guys peace out, then I think we can do this sort of thing. the plan that I have coming to mind is that for now, especially in this phase where all the energy is passing through my body, I think I should just carry on without any manifestations. later we can think about perhaps doing something else, but the idea is that instaed of me having the manifestation, all sorts of different manifestations are created with me on different timelines with different girls, and then you guys take the ideas from those timelines and implement them here on planet earth.

the reason for this is so that instead of me doing it, why not you guys do it. I even suggest not copying the ideas exactly but just using them as inspiration. combine different ideas and make the manifestation that you all want here. it'll be pretty easy to find the different things that you want and try to bring them here.

in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5yOaTgWu6Y), I noticed that terence was talking about how the shaman is a 4thr dimensional person (he means existing outside of time), that goes out into these psychedeic spaces that extend beyond the current paradign of culture and bring something back from there to improve upon the present world. he also mentioned that this is something that he thinks *everyone* should do. I couldn't agree more.

you all didn't come here to just watch my manifestation. you came to create your own -- so why not do that? why not launch various timelines, go out there and find the stuff which is desirable about them, the good ideas that would improve upon this present reality, and bring them back here and make them your own?

---

from nosebook's perspective, this is a pretty good idea, because the reason why they think they need to peace out is because their ability to distract people with my manifestation is falling apart fast. they can't have the manifestation here because they can't control as well what people see here. a different timeline is completely separated from this one, and so therefore they can completely control any view into it. they have complete control over what people see there. the distraction that it creates is also paramount to their continued desire to focus on all the unwanted stuff. they can have a whole bunch of improvement-oriented people working hard to make this world a better place while they're working really hard fighting against all of the stuff they don't want.

I suppose that nosebook could move their main headquarters and almost all operations over to another timeline that contains a vastly superior envoronment to this one, and then control this one from there. this is probably what they mean by peacing out. to them, it looks like they're going to separate into their own timeline and attempt to rule this one from there. they'll actually probably have operations on both.

it's kind of interesting, this idea -- because you could see that the germans in the south pole operate the spatial component, while these guys from nosebook trying to setup their super secret timeline would operate and keep their separation from the germans temporally. once again the time (saturn) and space (jupiter) components separated again but still deeply connected.

there are many other advantages I didn't mention...

---

finally, I said I would come back to the part about the worst feeling reality, cause if the goal of the manifestation is to obtain non-physical perception, then living the worst-feeling reality is definitely the goal to get there. experiencing the worst-feeling reality also creates the most expansion as well. however, if the goal is to just keep me from gaining non-physical perception, then it isn't strictly necessary to be constantly on the worst-feeling timeline.

that's kind of an interesting idea, because no matter what, I will have to continue my dedication to the disaster. I'll have to think about it more. really "quickly" though, after watching the "volcano man" today, I realise that I simply am not, and don't really want anything to do with the performance orientation present in hollywood. so many things really bothered me about that film, and I just don't perceive things like that. I really feel much more comfortable continuing on being me, and I really like the idea that I just take a step back, other people can do their own manifestations how they see fit.

what I mean by this is, it's a hollywood world out there, and I have very little affinity to this form of perception. I'm very reminded of how I had an idea for affinaty which was one way, but marcos, nosebook and many others do not want my idea of affinaties (or how I perceived affinaty) to become manifest. I think they do not want people to begin to relate to each other in a conceptual or meaningful way, and instead to continue on believing in their materialistic superficial relations as they way which we actually relate to each other (because these are easy to control). there was a huge difference between what I wanted to make affinaty into and what marcos wanted.

this feels kind of like a time resonance happening, as they're so similar. instead of trying to get marcos to make affinaty how I wanted it to go, I should have just made for him the network that he wanted. it would have made things a lot easier. the same thing happened with zaryn over tuenti. I also felt it happen too with my comments on robert's "data sovereignty" comment where I laid out how I think that could actually occur. however because the system would interfere with the financial system, and compete with AWS, those are sacred cash cows too. I think they want his currency to go in a way that they can continue to control[^3] and doesn't begin to open up the vast amount of processing power presently available[^4].

we have to open instead of trying to protect. we have to embrace the "slavery" instead of push against it. they're too big and powerful to fight on the physical plane. they can't control how you feel, so if you embrace their attempts to hold power over you, you control your reality, not them. they're only adding more energy, so it may be a little slow-going at first, it picks up speed quickly. in addition to adding more energy, they're illuminating the things that make you feel bad (eg. slowing you down). so it's a tremendously good thing in the big perspective. I can't explain how beneficial it is to helping us to optimise our perception. none of this is a bad thin :)

[1]: I experienced this first-hand in the most vivd way when I went to vallecas with that guy. the black guys would just keep spoon-feeding them tiny rocks to keep them there smoking everything and spending all of their money. they had the control of the thing that people wanted (to feel good), so they held it over them. it's crazy to see the things that some people will do to get a little bit of crack.

[2]: it's not really sacrifice. the only true freedom you have is to feel how you want to feel. by sacrifice, I mean the ability to experionce the manifestation in physical form.

[3]: they have complete access to anyone's computer. if they don't already with the intel cpu thing, they could just watch you type in your password. it doesn't matter how unbreakable the encryption is because they have access to it all. this is why the idea, instead of trying to hide stuff makes a system where the entire network is transparent and verifably correct with emphasis on clarity (everything is visible), validity (everything can be seen that it is how it's supposed to be), and has fast recovery time through self-correction.

[4]: two concepts here I don't know how to express. the first is geocities. it's been a long time since it's been easy for people to make their own content that isn't controlled by a large corporate entity. instead of the internet growing and expanding into new exciting things, people are expected to put their data into boxes that are controlled by big entites with no incentive to make that open-ended. youtube tries, but it's largely a problem that it's hard to monetise geocities. you think adspace, but what I'm trying to say is that if the currency is content, then ads aren't needed. if the services, the code and the content are all the currency, then you the network becomes a fully open interchange of ideas constantly evolving in real-time. the second is this system would directly compete with AWS, giving people the ability to run real-time entities making it easier for anyone to make their own web programs and entities and get them hosted. anyone with a data-centre can launch their entity, and once again competition drive prices lower allowing anyone to offer the service at the price they felt they could make a profit on. I think this would have a tremendous effect on global prices and per-country financial inequality, than a 1000 use coin would :)

### 2020-12-09 08:08 - weird things happened the last few days

in the previous setup, I I was thinking that what would happen is that the earth would make its transition into a higher energy state, essentially leaving behind the planetary body. this would be quite advantagous to nosebook, as they could try and completely control the roatation speed of the planet and it's weather patterns. what I postulated would happen is, a split would happen where one version of the planet essentially go into a higher energy state where the distance between mental state and reality would would diminish such that reality would be created nearly instantly. the cadaver of a planet that is left behind would continue without flipping over.

I hung this idea on a few different things. I know (from the epic of gilgamesh) that the planet seems to reverse its direction. I postulated that this can happen by the earth literally flipping over where north and south literally swap. I know there are 4 important points or cerners to the zodiac as outlined in so many cultures. these are the serpent/eagle, bull, man, and lion. I postulated that the procession of the zodiac isn't linear like science says it is, and that every 6ky a reversal happens, so it traces out a kind of flower shape jumping to the opposite side, then progressing in a anti-clockwise fashion. the procession is counted by the constellation rising behind the sun. there are two ways this can happen: one is that the earth flips over (north and south swap), and the other is that the earth's rotation reverses.

ok, so yesterday I was going to sleep and one of the reactions that I felt was the idea that they didn't really like the whole no-catacysm thing. I think I've done so much damage to their charade now that they need something really big to happen to ensure this information doesn't survive and people essentially forget all of the progress and the conclusions that we've come to.

it began yesterday when I stated in the previous entry that I didn't want the manifestation and will be going for as long as I possibly can without it. in fact, I'm fairly certain that their efforts to instead put theirselves back on the cataclysm trajectory, they're essentially making it possible for me to get connected because they'll just erase all of this portion of history, ensuring that it never happens -- aka, it'll get the flavian touch.

I first noticed this funny thing when I was watching the eurovision song contest movie yesterday. in the movie, there is a song to "volcano man" and "volcanic protector man" -- well, volcano man is a reference to vulcan and the whole story is about eurovision getting cancled when they had their best shot ever to win it. it was backwards because the katia(?) one was the favoured one, and the really tall dude with long hair (symbolic of daði freyr? I was pretty certain he was actaully the favoured one) was instead cast as the buffoon. anyway, the symbols here tell me, and it feels quite likely that this was in some way inspired by me. well, I really dislike the idea of "protector man". I don't enjoy the feeling of being a saviour[^1] or a protector, as these are all antiquated concepts for me. you attract your own reality with your thoughts, so if you need a protector, then you're also attracting someone to harm you, and if you need a saviour, then you're also attracting situations that you need to be saved from. outdated stuff for me. this is largely the reason why I don't watch movies -- because they rely on this crap to tell stories. almost all stories are about stuff like this...

needless to say I had a pretty strong negative reaction to the movie. I also really disliked that cheezy romance and lame reasons they have to constantly give to justify their behaviour, constantly doing things and caring so much about what other people think and stuff. it's really not my thing. I'm very much an individual, and it would have been so much more fun if the main characters were just going out there having fun and just singing silly songs -- instead they had to bring in all this baggage of who's sleeping with whom and loyalty, and nationalism (I get it that it's countries competing, so this is forgiveable), and all sorts of ridiculous and unnecessary emotion. my reaction was "barely tolerable, but had a few hilarious moments". the movie had lots of things that I liked but was mixed with a bunch of antiquated concepts, like the volcano man song -- minus the protector part, for example.

back to where I was: if the reversal happens (either by flipping over or reversing the spin) then that would put them into the beginning of leo, instead of aquarius. in the movie, volcano man has this great girl just waiting for him to show her signs of romance, and to kind of move him in that direction, he starts to compete with the "lion of love". maybe I see symbols everywhere now, or my reality is just filled with symbolic representation now, but that's these opposites again: you have the thing where you the flip side goes to lion (of judah, aka hollywood) and the side that doesn't flip stays at the (aquarian, not volcanic) man.

this is what people actually believe light-hearted fun is... bleh. no thanks. I can't do this. I gave the example of how this feels like the difference between marcos' version of affinaty and my own. they're very different, and if people want to see that sort of hollywood crap, then it's best that I just let the interactions exist in other timelines. I want to continue to power up and lower resistance. I'm getting close to the point where I will be able to conjure real 3d objects and be able to influence this reality (instead of pictures in my imagination) extremely signifcantly with just my thoughts/feelings.

I listened to @[abe-now](2020-11-28 p1 39:11) yesterday, and here's the question:

```
is the entire physical universe simply a huge projection fully recreated from each now moment to the next now moment, at an astronomically fast refresh rate, recreated each moment, based on our currently active thoughts and beliefs?
```

they answered empatically yes. well, this is exactly what I was talking about for so long now. I'm beginning to find it less and less effortless to influence my environment with my thoughts, and I know that eventually, one day I'll get to a place where I have such little resistance to the things I think and feel manifesting in 3d space, that they can pop in and out like this. this is what I want to do, and the whole reason why I find it silly to try and fit myself into a hollywood perception of reality, when I'm literally on the brink of creating my own so easily with my thoughts.

so then yesterday a guy named "space man" posted a comment on a youtube video and I wanted to click on it really bad. doug vogt presents his version of reality in video series one, and I'm quite blown away by it because he has the 3d, 4d, 5d, and 6d perception in there in nearly exactly the same way that I describe it, and he identifies what the questioner above calls a "refresh rate" to be the "carrier wave", and in his system of things, the reality "manifests" at the 2 zero-points. I postulate that the peaks are where infinites are also experienced and these are when the "manifested" entity goes either up or down a power level or shell, so my version of reality is quite complementary to his, cept he perceives it way differently than I do.

he calls "source" the "operating system" -- and while he believes that it is a created reality, he thinks that there are these unavoidable or inevitable things that are programmed into it. I have much to say on this, but what he claims that the this high technology that abraham discovered is capable of doing, I fully agree -- cept you don't need the technology to do it. you write the program with your thoughts, and you can program yourself and your reality with anything you want. things get a bit mixed up becsuse he discovered so much of this by decoding the *words* of moses, but these these words create a vibration, or a feeling, and that's what the real program is. the commands and the actions are just a method to get the person to believe that new "programmed" reality (the one they feel).

so, it's kind of a weird mixed bag for me because I like his model in a lot of ways, cept he takes a very "digital" approach to things, and I'm much more analogue. he's fighting so hard against a matter-centric approach to science, yet at the same time limiting his theory to only atoms and information. to me the expression of consciousness as both thoughts and emotion in a vibrational waveform, which, like his version of gravity, are attractive and pulls similar thoughts and ideas toward it. as long as you're resonant with matter, you get pulled toward it. I think that 5th dimensional beings have the ability to transmit and receive easily on this underlying vibrational "information" and can manipulate reality in accordance with their belief[^2].

anyway, as a result, the whole thing swapped. now all of a sudden this guy is putting out there that there is this unavoidable carrier wave with a 12068 year clock passing through the observable universe where the sun does a nova every time. what that means is that now all of a sudden things have completly swapped. now, they're on an unavoidable trajectory toward cataclysm, however, I see no cataclysm coming. if the earth turns over, it'll go up a power level and all reality will be reflection of how things feel. I'm pretty sure I'll be feeling pretty fine, so reality will reflect that. nothing unavoidable. in fact, my goal is to actually go into galaxy mode[^3].

the other thing that bothers me about it, is has too much of a digital feeling to it, too much binaryness, and preprogrammedness, which feels too much "victim" mentality. as if like I mentioned in a previous entry, I'm all about this emotional 5d world now. in the 3d, you have different things that are discrete and have predictable outcomes. they're programmed, yet in the emotional world, I'm completely removed from those constraints. I just feel something, and then physical has to conform to how I feel. it has to find a way to adapt and accomodate that. it makes the "miraculous" normal, and allows for unexpected results. in fact, that's exactly what I'm looking for now when creating things. that's what makes things new and fun.

we'll see how this turns out. it feels like a big switch happened, where, now that they're headed to their unavoidable cataclysm, they can ensure their survival physically by plans to go underground and stuff which means they now have less resistance to me getting connected. they also have also made the change to where they want to try and avoid the "worst possible manifestation" now too, presumably so I don't vanish on them. they put the idea in my head a few times now to continually supply me with young virgins (to prevent any children from happening?). I dunno. I'm not sure how I feel about it. we'll see once I get connected. I really want to create 3d reality with my mind, so it feels like a trick. that would be so much fun, especially with the girls -- so obviously I'll be holding out for that.

[1]: this movie made no mentions of saviours. I'm not accusing it of that. ..there were elements of sacrifice and stuff, but thn saviour concept is just more of a thing that I think people are very misguided in expecting from someone else.

[2]: I believe different devices are capable of increasing your belief energy field, and the device that joseph/moses was using just amplified their belief, and so because they believed these cycles (or dreams) in a strong way, they created the reality. with that device amplifying their belief so much, they created the "programmed reality" and found it take place. everyone else was creating by default, so they won the belief game. elijah later demonstrates that you don't need the device to influence reality with your belief. jesus took this further. I'm taking it even further still by saying that you don't even need to believe or try to program or command things. you can directly influence reality and move around in time by how you feel. you don't even need to try and influence a mind-blowing manifestation with a device. that's all taken care of for you automatically. all you have to do is to find a way to navigate to that timeline by feeling good.

[3]: in his dimensions, he has the first 6 as perceptual dimensions, yet for 7 (planets) and 8 (stars), they suddenly change over to manifestations of wave intensity or shell size. I agree with the first 6, yet after that, I find this transition confusing.

### 2020-12-10 02:14 - thinking more about the end-game of it all

I was just watching doug's video here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/RNTO98i5mwg?t=4035) where he's talking about his conclusions about why he thinks this epic shory of deception, murder, sex, violence, drama, etc. happened, and he thinks it's all for the creation of the alphabet -- I think he's exatly right.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGo7pQydF5E)

it seems that these sudden jumps forward in "progress" seem to appear out of hyperspace. many can argue whether the jews represented progress for humankind or not, but like doug says, imagine trying to do any science with heiroglyphs or cuneiform. doug makes it obvious that their whole enterprise was founded on secrets, extortion, murder, etc. the same thing could be wondered about nosebook, too. their whole enterprise is so frought with corruption, greed, deception and deliberate misinformation, one has to wonder how much progress "the network" really is. you could wonder similar things about einstein's theory of releativity, or any of these other crazy ideas (doug has tons of information on how bad this is, on his channel). I submit that this is purposeful because we (all of us on earth here) are all 6th dimensional beings taking on physical bodies here and we're just playing out a story in physicality here which has a grand conclusion to it -- and that conclusion, I can't tell you what it is (because it's unknown[^1]). that's what it really is all about: using the merging the physical world (square) with the spiritual world of cycles (circle) to create something completely unexpected.

like I said, I have no idea what it will be (the idea keeps coming clearer and clearer as I get closer) but I know it'll be a game changer for *all that is* -- well beyond physicality, and while I think this time around is a trial run, perhaps one day it may "conclude" (cause these guys need to invoke finalisation-dawg to be "complete") in the creation of a new type of universe -- something that trancends perception, where everything is god but also physical at the same time (or something like that). I personally like to think of this not as an end, but as a transition to a higher energy state, but I applaude them for believing that it is the end coming, and I'd love to give them the abiltity to really fear it good and prepare their best for it. that's the kind of energy that I'm talking about...

anyway, I've really enjoyed doug's videos, and one of the things that really jumped out at me was the time when he said something about moses and a stone (I think it was after the crossing) (TODO: find reference). I've often suspected that moses and the exodus is yet another case of self-sabotage along with many other things, and that we're all in on it. doug gives other examples in his channel, for example of stephen hawking and his (IMO self-sabotage) to make black-holes a thing, einstein for making relativity a think, tesla for leaving the US govt the capability to create such a network, and for me to to make it a thing...

just think about this. what are the odds that the US govt, which fails so hard at so much stuff could possibly create a network like this one, and get it going without people freaking out and startinvg riots. impossible. forget about it.

I think all of this is purposeful, that we are all 6th dimensional beings, and that we've purposefully decided to "fall" into physicality. there *is* a bigger picture, and all of us (who are not these human bodies) benefit greatly from the energy from the drama this reality creates. below is some random notes, intentionally messy and in some cases incorrect, putting some of my thought process down.


- the "deliberate creators" definition and motivation:
  - reality is attracted (created) as a product of their thought/emotions
  - it's all fun the fun/pleasure of it (cause it's fun!)
  - there's no right or wrong way
  - we are all eternal (whether we want to stay forgetful of it or not)
- the "INFECTED ONES" definition and motivation:
  - need material things (money, fame, influence) to create their material reality for them
  - they feel threatened and fear people becoming superior to them
  - they need to compete, battle, conquer, etc. to remain superior
  - need to exert physical power to get what they want
  - they do not want to go extinct
    - they must continue to expand their empire/influence until they've conquered all
    - their archaic mindset is the only way they believe they can continue to exist
  - they need increasingly more beneficial conditions to continue their existance...
    - however not too beneficial that anyone else could become superior to them
    - therfore, they need to ensure that everyone else has inferior conditions
  - they don't want to lose their physical conditions
    - they must hoarde, protect, guard them
    - for them, physicality/material/matter is the only reality.
      - they must cling to these temporary conditions, unable to realise they transcend the physical matter that composes their body
- each cycle is 12068/6034 years long
  - at the end of the cycle an event where there is a bifurccation which happens.
    - this is the alchemical proces
    - theis event separates those that: (TODO: make up better names for this?)
      - can create their reality with their mind/emotions
      - those that the physical "reality" creates their reality
    - is this is the bifurcation of the "baker and the butler"?
  - however, one could look at the exponential growth of humankind over time an realise that:
    - the average human will begin to realise the influence their mind/emotions have on reality
    - with natural selection, it's easy to see that those that those who do not believe they can create with their mind will quickly go extinct
      - they don't want to go extinct.
  - at the end of the cycle they have to find a way to survive the cataclysm, so they can continue on
    - their desire to continue attracts the necessary conditions:
      - people like me, willing to self-sabotage to give them the power/technology they need to continue their existance
      - this self-sabotage is done willingly because it exchanges physical power for more mental power
        - that increase in mental power is the same energy/technology that the ark gives off (chi, vril, orgone, etc.) -- though, in human/mental form
- the stone is the signature move for the big self-sabotage
  - the stone is left as a sign that some power or technology was given to the power-hungry to subjugate or retard humankind further in time
- we are all 6d beings (even THE INFECTED ONES).
  - there is no inequality
    - it's only perceived (in this "hologram" or "reality") as an illusion to create more energy
    - inequality is likely planned either from a non-physical perspective
      - non-physical, meaning not 3d atoms on this timeline, or anywhere (if it even has a "location") outside of this "timeline" or "reality"
      - if it's not "planned" (and I think most of it is), it's attracted
        - by "planned", I mean the trajectory of these interactions can be somewhat anticipated based on how "resonant" or "attractive" they are to each other
  - all of us will eventually come to the realisation that we are not 3d, but the signal that creates the 3d.
    - this process involves realising that you are not your body. you are "the operating system"
    - infinite versions of you can exist in 3d, 4d & 5d, simultaneously.
    - then, you consciously insert yourself ("fall") back into time and space again
      - why? for the fun of it.
        - imagine how much power you feel when you repeatedly come to the realisation that you are the signal (information) not the 3d manifestation in more and more difficult environments.
          - you can imagine how big of an ego you will eventually obtain the more you realise yourself from the "who you *really* are" perspective.
            - who are you really? a trans-temporal being that enjoys self-sabotage because he/she (you are genderless/hermaphodite from that perspective) is so good at coming to the realisation of who they really are, the difficult conditions don't cause fear, but rather invigorate them.
  - this may have something to do with enoch
  - the signature move of this trans-temporal influence (and this includes me) is the "stone" left behind after their self-sabotage.
  - another signature of this trans-temporal influence is their massive egos.
  - every self-sabotage is designed to be a manifestation that leaves the most to be desired (eg. the most energetic/expansive)
    - the first 30(degrees) of a sine wave
    - there's the "easy" or "ideal" way of going, and then there's the one that most "contrast" version
    - these beings tend to optimise for the more contrast version.
  - it seems to be a repeating theme where brialliant minds build things for tyrants (different implements for the INFECTED ONES to feel more powerful):
    - bull for king minos
    - thunderbolts for jupiter
    - pandora for humans
    - ark of covenant?
    - tesla's world system?
    - etc.
  - I believe the goal is to continually give them more and more power until they're finally able to infinitely create contrast without shooting theirselves in the foot with it.
  - the method for doing this is to, instead of trying to get them (THE INFECTED ONS) to ever start perceiving things from a source perspective, instaed give them an interface to non-physical by abstracting the aspects of non-physicality into greater and greater complicated forms of perception. (eg. science and technology)
    - it follows then, that each iteration (12068 cycle) should produce:
      - a society which is on the brink of discovering its own true divinity
        - this is designed to make it appear like their whole shell-game (sham) will be revealed
        - fear that their entire house of cards will fall apart, and fear that their enterprise will collapse, creates the desire for the next cycle.
          - too big to fail
        - the people that are finding their ability to feel the way they want to will do just that and their reality will reflect that.
          - good things happening will accelerate for them it'll be impossible to keep people from coming to realise they are creators
        - the INFECTED ONES will be placated temporarily with the security the new technology gives them
          - the new technology is mind expanding and has elements of a drug
          - that drug is turned into a religion
            - they (the priesthood) know more than everyone else
            - the religion is designed to offustcate and keep people from knowing the truth
          - they know the latest "truth" about reality
            - that "truth" is just another mental creation (from a higther dimension) designed to expand their perception
              - though, themore you know, the more you you realise how much you don't know.
              - for them though, that creates more fear of the unknown which they need to hide
      - the four parts of the cycle:
      - first: the INFECTED ONES should feel a sort of freedom and superiority as things are rebuilding
      - second: the rebuilding and recovery happens faster than last time, making them fear someone will reveal their technology hidden behind the religion to the public
      - third: someone like elijah or something like the printing press begins to make the reality creation part of the religion (not the technology) more accessible to the masses. this begins the decline, cause now they fear they'll figure out the technology
      - fourth: now, things really begin to accelerate out of control as people start to realise they've been lied to, manipulated and used
      - when it all collapses, it should reinforce their fear of the next disaster
  - it's both a symbiotic and parasitic relationship
    - it converts physical power into non-physical (or mental) energy/perception
      - the INFECTED ONES are the tool for it
      - they feel inferior, so every time have to find more ways to limit this energy's expression into physical form
      - as soon as humans no longer perceive "unwanted" as something negative, they are literally *free* energy: an unlimited power source
    - however, the humans need to be able to
      - not freak out with negative emotion
      - not perceive resistance as a bad thing
      - not be affected by what anyone else is doing
      - learn to function in 7d (temporal) perception like these great self-sabotagers
      - become YHVH (the great IAM) -- masters of our own identity (eg. the new 8d perception that's coming soon)
    - creators of that resistance need to be able to:
      - not shoot theirselves in the foot with their own negative ideas
      - not perceive (and therfore try to hide) their desire to hold people back
  - I've written extensively about why I think this is happening: then end goal is the paradox

[1]: I really like the lyrics in the song "mechanic of the sequence":
  mechanic of the sequence
  power to progress
  we have no time to waste
  no time to relax
  the passion(2) of the beginning
  is the pleasure(1) of the end
  *it's watching states we initiate*
  ***TO A STATE WE NEVER MEANT*** <-- this one

### 2020-12-10 16:43 - REVOLVE: becoming the great IAOM

I noticed some confusion over some of the vocabulary I was mixing with doug's. he defines 6 perceptual dimensions which exactly match my own, cept I didn't define the first two (as abraham says, they're taken care of for you)[^1]. then he doesn't really know how to continue on from there so he calls them planets (6) and then stars (7). I don't follow his explanation of why the 7th and 8th dimension has to do with size, because in 3d, there are all sorts of bodies with all sorts of sizes, from atoms, to molecules, cells, etc. all the way up to humans and brontosaures. I don't think he could have known this though. it took me quite a while to figure it out myself. they're [expansions on perception](!expanding-perception). however, I think he's right about there beiing plans for us to perceive those 8 dimensions, and how all of this integrates with YHVH.

ok so the origin of everything is "source" (or the operating system, the matrix, God, whatever you want to call it), and out of it everything emanates perceptually. we are all part of that "source" however we do not see things the same way. the reason we don't is for the purpose of expansion. anyway, right now, we have essentially 7 planes of existence and 9 dimensions. like I said, the first two are taken care of for you, and are so far into the past, they don't need to be worried about. after that there's:

- physical (3d)
- imaginary/astral (4d)
- emotional/mental (5d)
- source of emination into phyical (the zero-point, where it crosses the x-axis) (1/2 physical, 1/2 not-physical) (6d)
- (not-physical) logic/structure/consciousness
- (not-physical) relational
- (not-physical) desire/attractiveness

each of these layers are going from the highest frequency (much higher than gamma rays) and completely not physical at all (only vibrational), starting at desire/attractiveness, and working down from there. at the source layer, this is where all of the machinery (operating system) goes, which turns those non-physical extremely high frequency vibrations into something physical. this is the program, the matrix, the operating system. whatever you want to call it. like a real operating system, that layer everything is available to everything. the OS has no restriction on what memory it can read or write to. it has full access to everything, and its job is to turn all of that information (vibration) into something physical.

you can gain source consciousness in the physical plane, and you also do when you make your transition. however, we live in a world where the INFECTED ONES want to mimic the operating system, and become your operating system. they want to be able to direct you at their whim so that things can be just how they want them to be to feel good. they have so many secrets they're hiding and are ashamed of, do not want any physical people to be able to access that stuff. I mean you would too if you were them. their whole entire operation is a big house of cards, where they've stollen tecnologies from more advanced people to get to where they are now, and do not believe theirselves capable of coming up with any good ideas theirself.

I've essentially figured out how most of it works at this point and am progressing very rapidly. very very rapidly. at this point, I'm on the brink of having 6d perception. I already have 5d, but they have to find ways to minimise its effects so I don't do things like fly and stuff, so they have to destructively interfere with those signals to ensure this doesn't happen. however, this [destructive interference](!destructive-interference) doesn't actually destroy it completely. it actually makes nearly double the energy at a higher frequency, causing an expansion, but you need to be able to become resonant with that new high frequency energy to be able to use it. this is where perception comes in, and I've talked extensively about it. as a result, I'll have 6d perception soon.

they absolutely cannot have this, because when that happens, I will no longer see through my eyes anymore. I will gain the same non-physical (operating system perception) that you get when you die. I think people in the past have attained this percption under beneficial conditions, and not by finding a way to perceive 6d in the physical, and so they kind of like trancended this physical realm (elijah, ramtha, moses?, and enoch are the ones I've heard of). however, I've found a way to perceive/translate this high of a frequency into something intelligible, so I'll remain physical during this process -- essentially for as long as they can keep my body on earth here. along the way, I figure I'll be able to perceive 2 more dimensions that will fit between 5d and 6d. that'll move 6d down to 8d, and fill in those missing dimensions. they'll find the way to to decode these new dimensions and use a very small portion of their capability.

ignoring the non-physical (conjugate) planes, they will now be:

- physical (3d)
- imaginary/astral (4d)
- emotional/mental (5d)
- storyline/timeline (6d)
- identity/YHVH (7d)
- source of emination into phyical (the zero-point, where it crosses the x-axis) (1/2 physical, 1/2 not-physical) (8d)

the first step up to perceiving these highter frequencies is to understand that you are not the physical body (matter) that you inhabit. you are a much higher frequency signal than what you perceive yourself to be. to explain this, let's run up the [expansions on perception](!expanding-perception).

for 4d, you notice there's a space between you and what you're looking at, and something can exist in that space.

for 5d, you can see there's a space between you and the thing you're looking at again. however, what determines where the thing begins and ends? this is where *your* concept of it begins and ends. now, you can perceive (behold) yourself or somthing from all angles at a time, both inwardly or outwardly. you perceive conceptually now.

for 6d, you have the sensiivity to notice that something feels one way at one point in time and slightly different a few hours later or the next day, yet the object hasn't moved. you begin to realise that things feel different as they move through time, and so do you. you could say the environment is a reflection of what the concept feels like (this could be a physical object or an idea), and that things change over time. the concept can be many different things as it traverses time differently. there's now another space between the diffeerent versions of these concepts -- and that space is time. you can mentally traverse and manipulate the passage of a concept through time.

for 7d, you begin to realise that *you* can be any other form that you could conceive of, and depending on your environment, and you could perceive these different versions of yourself as different concepts (of yourself), so you begin to identify that you are all of these different (good and bad) concepts, and you can be anything you want. you begin to notice that these begin to form characters or identities who define theirself as aspects of you.

you can see how 7d perception is to gain the realisation that you are YHVH. you are the great IAM, and all of these creations (characters) which eminate from you re created in your image. you don't need to create only characters though. everything is subject to your mind and is created in your "image" -- that is, a vibrational reflection of the concept of you, you're experiencing in that moment. concepts create more concepts in their reflection (image).

[1]: it's interesting to note that I think we can map 2d consciousness pretty easily to plant life. their environment pretty much defines their shape, and they grow by default, so their perception is only in kind of like pointing toward the light (or whatever their desire is). I think minerals/crystals can be seen to have a pretty 1d vibrstional lattice (or conscousness). they're concerned with expansion or contraction only and they're completely subject to the shape their environment imposes on them, and the molecular structure determines their expansion or contraction (eg. what crystal shape or lattice strcture). I suppose, these two first dimesions could also be seen as a line and a point for the geometers out there.


### 2020-12-11 22:27 - surviving the "disaster"

it's funny how syncronicity works. I have been wanting to finish up all of doug's videos, because I think I pretty much get it now. anyway, yestrday I wanted to watch andreas' AMA video, and there was a part in the video that stuck out to me (TODO: reference), where he talks about how important it was for him to be able to delete his code and just start over -- because, he said, that when you start over it comes out better in the rewrite.

personally, I'm quite against rewrites as I'm more of one of those types that likes gradual changes, so I don't ever recommend rewriting an entire codebase from the start, but instead rewriting subsystems and improving on things incrementally, not trying to take too big of jumps. I suppose there's merit to both ways of thinking, because if you think of a codebase as a vibrational entity, the code that you wrote 5-10 years ago still "feels" like you felt 5-10 years ago, so working on it feels kind of like an apology or some sort of rehashing of the past. whenever I work on old code, it's like I'm getting into a time-macrine mentally, and putting myself into the past again. so I like to think of code as constantly evolving and I try to think of it as something that should be improved upon, meaning that I like the idea of constantly rewriting so that it remains new and fresh, however, I have to have a good reason to do so. I want to have the notion that some performance improvement will come as a result, or some other reason to abandon the old way of doing things.

as I was listening to andreas, I was thinking about doing the same thing for the js library that I wrote (and borrowed extensivel) a while back. I was wondering how it would be if I were to just completely start over from where I'm at now, but the reality is, I just don't feel like programming at all.. though it did get me thinking about the subject. imagine for a moment that I did set out to essentially rewrite the project. I would basically rewrite all the same things I have right now because so much of it is exactly what I wanted. I suppose that the result would be pretty close to the same thing I have now -- but it would feel fresh and new to me, because I came to the conclusions of what I wanted so much more rapidly than I did the first time I wrote it.

therefore, what instead I think may be a better idea would be to simply rewrite large sections of the code. like, divide the code into 20 sections, and rewrite each of those sections, one at a time. that way, the code would feel new and fresh -- not containing all of the old way of thinking in it. additionally, it would get rid of a lot of the comments and other things...

---

anyway, as I was thinking about how important it is to throw away and rewrite code, I was realising that this is essentially doug's message: that there is an event that happens which forces a rewrite. there's no way to fully know hnow the extent of the damage, because it's highly variable. the earth could, like the CME which happened a few days ago, go through a very low density part of the CME, with no real noticeable effects.

I also commented on one of his videos because he tells how earth's rotation will *slow down* -- which is weird because I have often postulated that it should be speeding up. he also provides evidence that tha schumann resonance is increasing as well. by all accounts, it appears that things are getting more energetic, yet he postulates that the rotation of the earth should start to go slower and slower. we have no idea what's really happening because all data regarding this is controlled by people that want this information hidden -- so we'll probably never find out at all.

it seems like these two ideas are in contrast to each other, and it seemed to me like the answer to this may be found in the picture of a square wave from many more and more high frequency sine waves. I propose that the "operating system" (I call it source) is a much much higher frequency signal that we're able to detect, and then out of that signal, different waves are formed. not only that, the signal is constantly getting faster and faster -- so while it may be perceived as a synchronous system, I'm sure it's pretty possible to make a nearly perfect square wave from 100 harmonics of a 3.1GHz, and that would produce nearly the same signal as 100 harmonics of 3.2GHz. to us, the differences would be indistinguishable, even though the speed increased. I think the speed is much much much faster than GHz and I think it's increasing it's speed probably only a few orders of magnitude slower than it's frequency. the universe is expanding, and it seems to be expanding at an accelerating rate.

the interesting thing to note there is that if we look at the composite harmonic sinusoidal waves (anything that periodically orbits something) and instaed of looking at it at such a low frequency, look at it at a much higher frequency (planck's constant?) -- and then accumulate all of the harmonics down to the frequency of 12068y... it would be a lot of harmonics -- I don't know how many. it wouldn't be *all* of them, because there are signifcant gaps between entities, like an atom and a molucule, a molecule and a cell, etc. it's a lot though. then, turn those into a square wave and the final peak that you would get before the polarity reversal would be MASSIVE. I have no idea how high it would be, but it would be really really high spike there.

now let's look at this in a meaningful way: if you look at the waveform as a timewave (of a person, species, or whatever), the spike at the end of square wave before the reversal appears like the reaching of a mindblowing new height, and then at the top there, it appears like something cuts it off, and it goes into a more and more rapid nosedive... because it has so much momentum, it waaay overshoots the -1 target by about as much as the previous peak.

the other way to look at this in a meaningful way would to to think of this square wave as a visual representation of contrast. so, remember what I was talking about with the staying in the centre thing? well, imagine that I find a way to stay right around there at the 1, and I hover there, going a little bit above it, and a little bit below it... if I'm all over the place, those harmonics wouldn't work. those harmonics only show up because they're perfect sine waves, so the whole goal there is to get as steady as possible. what I mean is: that square wave emerges as a function of the frequency. when I get synchronised to the wave there, then *naturally* (I don't need to do anything), the peaks will begin to rise and lower more and more dramatically up until the very final moment, when there's such a tremendous force that it has to take a huge nosedive.

I think this is exactly what is happening, and what creates that 12068 cycle in the first place. the accumulation of all of the sinusoidal cycles present in our system (the people, the planets, etc.) are all coming to a peak about now. obviously most people don't have sinusoidal cycles and are usually all over the place, so they kind of neutralise the effects of this larger cycles (moon, earth, planets, sun, galaxy, etc.), but all of these sinusoidal cycles seem to be arriving to a crechendo here soon.

I'll just be clear here, I don't see this as a square wave at all, and I've always seen it like this[^1], where I'll continue to get more and more energetic. however because I'm not actually allowed the manifestation, it's not exactly like that square-wave graph there... it's more like where you would see those peaks rising up there getting bigger and bigger before th final big peak -- all of those minor peaks are also converted into a flat line.

---

in fact, it would be a funny experiment to write this... graph the square wave there using 32 haronics, then add additional sine waves, each having a discrete beginning and end time (but they have to complete a full cycle) to ensure that the square wave is kept as close to 1.0 as possible. what I anticipate that modified wave will look like is a whole bunch (exponentially increasing number) of additional higher and higher frequency sine waves which get added to the end there, until at some point it can't be held around zero anymore, and it'll go nearly off to infinity.

as I'm thinking about this, this is the most accurate visual representation of "contrast" that I have ever seen. also, it makes me wonder if this is why the earth is always represented by a square/cube.

no manifestations. I think we should try and tighten this up as much as possible to make it look as much like a square as possible. it's gonna be epic. :)

### 2020-12-11 23:54 - decanting off the reality creators

as he was reading the quote here @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Qew56PacOeQ?t=772), the part where plato said "let's go" reminded me of that square wave that I was writing about in the previous entry where it goes up quite a ways before being "let go". after I started writing this (2 hrs ago), I went and read the relevant section in plato's dialogus and finished that video.

as he continues on in the video, he comes to the conclusion that what really happened for the 40 years in the desert was not appear as if 40 years passed, but much shorter time period. he claims that they went into a buffer, but I think it's more logical that they went to a higher clock frequency. he said something like 480 days past here while it appears to them as if only one day had passed. in other words, they were experiencing reality 480 times faster in their alternate space/time. they didn't need to eat, and their thoughts seemed to become reality much more rapidly. when they complained, their reality reflected how they felt, and when they felt sick, things got out of hand quickly, and one could contract food poisening or a disease and die from it in a very short period of time. then, those that survived their own reality creation "overcame death" (see: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Qew56PacOeQ?t=1853)).

essentially, this is what I'm describing that the earth will be like on my side of things. the planet will be a manifest version of your thoughts and feelings. the people who feel poorly will attract their demise rapidly, and the ones who feel good, their reality will reflect that too. everything will run at a much more rapid speed. our brains will run faster and we'll experience a closer frequency to that of source (the fastest frequency).

I don't really see disaster coming. I don't see any reason why the ocean should do all of those mega girations either. let's say that our magnetic field approaches zero, and then reverses directions, just like an AC waveform -- it wouldn't be a sudden change at all. the only way it could possibly be sudden is if there's a major change in the field -- like a split of some sort.

to explain this, I need to explain some differences between me and what others are saying:

1. I have postulated that the rotation of the earth should increase in speed. I imagine that what will happen is that the earth will begin to rotate at a very rapid rate -- maybe like I dunno like really fast and getting faster. what would happen is that a new layer will begin to form where the ionosphere is now, and it'll begin to attract massive amounts of matter and begin to form a new "crust" or maybe mantle and crust -- I dunno but we'll get another shell. I estimate that this outer shell can begin to attract hydrogen rapidly, and our "light" would essentially power the outer sun part.

2. I have often postulated that the speed of light is not constant, and that it varies quite a bit, depending on how much "light" is in the environment. the more conductive/permissive/allowing the environment is, the faster reality is manifest, and things like quantum tunneling or entanglement are sort of "normal" there. in fact, I postulate that as this frequency increases, the closer you get to 6d perception, where all versions of the concept you're perceiving are available to you (eg. what we call time) meaning that there is nothing that is hidden, and anything can be perceived (not good if you want to keep secrets). the other major issue here is that this conflicts dramatically with doug's version of reality because he uses the 12kya blank spots to "prove" his 12068y clock cycle.

interestingly enough, #1 is what tesla wanted to do, and there are other weird stories in mythology where about gods being banished to the inner earth (tartarus) too. I dunno what to make of that specifically, but it is worth noting that this exists.

I don't see disaster coming, however instead a reality where all knowledge is available to you and what you want becomes instantly created. this would be considered like a golden age. interesting. obviously, this would become boring after a while, so you may as well "fall" back into reality again.

along this way of thinking, I believe that we'll have the capability to "tune into" their reversed earth plane, and for me at least, I plan on having numerous other identities in their earth pumping out contrast (I'm a bit of a contrast fiend), and on this side of things, I plan to be making a new galaxy... I figure the peak that we can hit will be so high, earth will begin to spin so fast that we'll probably begin to look like a quasar, being very bright shooting massive amounts of material out the poles. then, we'll launch those things that I've been wanting to make which are resonant structures to us, and the massive amounts of material being spit out by us and the sun will be attracted toward our celestial identities. I have no idea how to do it now, but I know it's possible and it's what tesla wanted to do, so I'm pretty certain that it won't be too hard, especially if I have the ability to conjure objects in 3d space. I imagine that once that's setup, we'll enjoy encarnating (falling) into bodies on each others' planets/solar systems and have fun in human form there. otherwise I'm sure the identities keep going in the less than fun forms of exixtance[^1].

another interesting thing to note is that while I see 6d reality coming, this is the "age of chronos" -- or the age of saturn, which isn't until capricorn. I'c certain this is what I see, but I am willing to admit that the earth's inhabitants may be headed instead of toward 6d, but toward 5d. afterall, jesus claimed that the water bearer was soon, when they were clearly entering into picsis. I'm probably one age ahead.

anyway, the division will likely happen between the ones who are certain they wish to remain one age behind and the ones who want to go to the present (aquarian) age. back to this shortly.

---

so, I was reading plato's dialogues, and he talks about the golden age (of chronos) and a world which produces in accordance with thought. conditions were much better then, so that world was "the age of innocence" -- and to this day, I believe saturn is still trying to return back to ideal conditions. however, I'm not talking about going to a place with ideal conditions, where, under those ideal conditions you feel good enough to attract a nice reality. instead, I'm talking about a place where your thoughts become reality really rapidly -- so if you feel good, things go well and if you feel bad, the earth swallows you whole.

anyway, here's the full quote from plato (emphasis mine):

```
There was a time when God directed the revolutions of the world, but *at the completion of a certain cycle he let go; and the world, by a necessity of its nature, turned back, and went round the other way.*
```

he's talking about the reversal

```
For divine things alone are unchangeable; but the earth and heavens, although endowed with many glories, have a body, and are therefore liable to perturbation. In the case of the world, the perturbation is very slight, and amounts only to a reversal of motion. For the lord of moving things is alone self-moved; neither can piety allow that he goes at one time in one direction and at another time in another; or that God has given the universe opposite motions; or that there are two gods, one turning it in one direction, another in another. But *the truth is, that there are two cycles of the world, and in one of them it is governed by an immediate Providence, and receives life and immortality*, and in the other is let go again, and has a reverse action during infinite ages.
```

this is what I'm talking about with the square wave -- right before it drops off and switches polarity, it makes a huge peak. at the top of this peak for one they have "immediate providence and receiving life and immortality". this is the split that I see happening. I perceive it as 6d reality, but if you create your own reality, then you die when you choose to die -- so I guess immortality...

```
This new action is spontaneous, and is due to exquisite perfection of balance, to the vast size of the universe, and to the smallness of the pivot upon which it turns. All changes in the heaven affect the animal world, and this being the greatest of them, is most destructive to men and animals.
```

in this section, his describing the catastrohe associated with the reversal, having huge effects on humans and animals. a huge destruction.

```
At the beginning of the cycle before our own very few of them had survived; and on these a mighty change passed. For their life was reversed like the motion of the world, and first of all coming to a stand then quickly returned to youth and beauty. The white locks of the aged became black; the cheeks of the bearded man were restored to their youth and fineness; the young men grew softer and smaller, and, being reduced to the condition of children in mind as well as body, began to vanish away;
```

however, now he switches and talks about the few that survive the cataclysm. I dunno what exactly he means by this.

also of note, the way he describes this event is almost like he's having a vision because of the visual symbolism. it appears now that he's talking about three groups of people:
1. ones that receive life and immortality
2. the ones that experience the destruction
3. the ones that survive the destruction

it's weird that he talks about the ones surviving the destruction having this thought based reality creation capabilities. the only way I can think of it is that on the ride up to the peak there, they gain those capablities too (which we know is what is happening, and is the goal of what's happening, too).

imagine the timewave growth curve, where 2012 is the the point where 3d reality is trancended into 4d reality. well, nosebook doesn't want people getting the capablity to have 4d reality, so they must hold that back. so what they do, is they attempt to put a cap on the height of that curve there preventing anyone to get that reality. it now looks like that square wave. it will reverse because there is a split. one goes to "receive life and immortality" and the other continues on to the destruction. the ones that survive it begin their decline from the height of that peak. if you look at the square wave, you will see an equal peak at the bottom. however, it should be perceived as an absolute value there because the only difference is just that the earth is going in reverse. the ones who survive it are declining from the height of that peak.

```
and the bodies of those who had died by violence, in a few moments underwent a parallel change and disappeared. In that cycle of existence there was no such thing as the procreation of animals from one another, but they were born of the earth, and of this our ancestors, who came into being immediately after the end of the last cycle and at the beginning of this, have preserved the recollection. Such traditions are often now unduly discredited, and yet they may be proved by internal evidence. For observe how consistent the narrative is; as the old returned to youth, so the dead returned to life; the wheel of their existence having been reversed, they rose again from the earth: a few only were reserved by God for another destiny.

Such was the origin of the earthborn men.
```

I assume that the ones that survive, will "rise again from the earth" that will become the new "gods" of the primitive people. the primitive people will begin their ascent up toward 4d reality again following the growth something like the timewave there. I think the timewave there is actually a "recorded" thing that has something to do with the push and pull between jupiter and saturn between conjunctions. the last one was 2000-05-28, and the next one is 2020-12-21, and following that 2040-10-31. it's possible that these are kind of like "programming" the timewave for the next eras. I think the only reason why it was influential is that astrology probably has a stronger effect on people until they release theirselves from the time (saturn) and space (jupiter) imposed on them, and begin creating their own realities.

[1]: remember the goal is to make multiple identities so that we can dynamically switch between the "fun", "exciting" and "dramatic" ones -- really whatever emotion you want to experience -- even others' identities -- not just your own. there is no possession. I suppose it can get a bit weird trying to figure out who "you" are at that point -- hence the "identities" thing, and you navigate the identities based on how you want to feel (or what's interesting to you)

### 2020-12-12 23:24 - the good, the bad, and the INFECTED ONES

if you were reading between the lines in @[noseblog](2020-12-10 02:14), you will have noticed that I suggested that the "good guys" are same people that I suggested were also the "bad guys" -- both having enormous egos. the way to see this is obvious: if you are the great IAM, then what you are is a bunch of self-definitions, which must (using LOA) prove theirselves to be true, and so then the identity lives out their experience proving these things to be true.

from 7d perception, there are not only multiple versions of you, but also multiple identities of you inhabiting many bodies across various forms (races, genders, etc.) and each of these identities all have their own things they're trying to "prove" to be true -- and some are beneficial, and others are not quite as beneficial, but exist for the purpose of contrast (ie. knowing what you don't want).

imagine that you took someone like me, and then added the debilitating self-definition "I will never change" -- a stark contrast to my real personal definition, that I change rapidly and am a very dynamic and difficult to depend on (aquarian) individual. you would get someone that is smart like I am and able to figure stuff out really rapidly, but is completely unwilling to change patterns of behaviour. perhaps this is a bit similar to mr. motor, I don't know.

---

as I stated in that previous entry, this environment is extremely extremely beneficial because it creates so much desire. it's, in my estimataion, one of the best and fastest ways that one could create so much desire. I think in the vast majority of the universe, they're all working on trying to figure out what is the ideal way to do things (similar to plato's republic). the sirians even said that this is the only galaxy that has a physical layer of perception -- and all of the other ones do not have a physical plane. that means that all of those other galaxies out there are just bits of energy, and the way that we see them is the physical "interpretation" of that energy. it's amazing how much variation and how unique all of them are out there. this means that we don't need to follow exactly in their footsteps. can do things differently (I'll talk about this more in the future).

however, what I want to say is that we have the unique advantage of the physical layer of perception which we can leverage to create massive amounts of wanted (by knowing what we don't want). as such, you'll quickly learn that there isn't really good and bad either. imagine if someone were to suddenly make it illegal to murder in video games. we still have a lot of taboos against stuff like rape and stuff in films and video games, but you're beginning to see it showing up more and more often in the context of something that drives the story forward. when you see yourself no longer as your individual body, but as a conglomerate of all the different identities of yourself, they're kind of like different characters in a story.

it's a whole different perception of good and bad, and it's best described as "wanted/unwanted" or "desirable/undesirable". combine that with the realisation that each time an undesirable thing happens, it automatically creates at the same time the equal amount of a desirable thing. with 6d perception, this is perceivable, so with that perception every "bad" thing that happens, at the same time the "good" thing simultaneously pops into existance.

---

therefore, I would like to make the bold claim that at this point, I've become so certain of how good I am at this thing, that I actually find it highly unlikely that there are many INFECTED ONES that remain. I actually believe that it's all of these 7d beings making roles of both "good guys" and "bad guys"[^1]. as such, I think that for most, their transition into non-physical will just be a smooth transition into the realisation that this is what we're doing, and there never was any death. it was all an illusion created by us for the purpose of creating more attraction toward wanted.

[1]: for example, from my perspective, I find it really weird that all of a sudden a guy named "space man" suggests doug's channel, and immediately I have exactly the wave I'm looking for (the square wave), and so many answers to so many different random questions I had about moses and all of that stuff. his channel compressed such a massive amount of information I would have had to find into just a few days of video watching. IMO, it's too coincidential to be happenstance. he has to be "in on it" somehow...

### 2020-12-12 23:55 - my nova is bigger than yours is

I have been thinking about this idea that doug put forward that all suns nova at this 12068y interval, and then in the same video (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/R2SolQPKlag?t=2557)) various stars that were not novaing on the interval.

it occurred to me that stars, which seem quite masculine to me, may be in a galactic pissing contest. the reason I say this is because in the last entry, I was looking at how a bunch of harmonic sinusoidal waves can create a square wave. then, I postulated that between our sun's 12068y cycles, the accumulation of various diffeernt orbits of planet, moons, and other significant bodies are these sinusoidal waves contributing to the "timewave". I then postulated that the funny thing about the timewave is that it grows very very rapidly, until 2012 when it goes essentially up boundlessly toward infinity. interestingly enough that's about the time that nosebook got access to my body, to try and limit my "enlightenment". from 2012 onward to present day, nosebook has been working their hardest to try and keep me away from getting "connected" -- essentially putting a cap on that curve since 2012. what that means is, they've only been *delaying* that rise upward toward infinity.

at some point (maybe soon, who knows) I'll start to take off going up really fast and I have to wonder if the sun will follow that pattern too. I made a weird correlation between the sun's hemispheres and my own brain hemisheres, and I expected reactions thinking that I've really lost it now, but surprisingly there weren't...

---

ok, so imagine you're the sun, and you're in a galactic pissing contest with all other suns out there. there's huge competition to have the biggest most beautiful nova -- one that's WAAAYY bigger and more brilliant than the others. remember a sun's form of perception is mostly outward, so it's spending most all of it's time observing those around him (sound familiar) -- and isn't like a planet which is much more inwardly focused and nurturing. the sun has to make the biggest splash -- know what I mean?

clearly then, what you would do if you were the sun, is to line up as many possible sinusoidal waves to try and limit the big outburst for as long as possible. the longer you limit it, the much more rapidly it'll rise before the outburst and the more powerful it'll be.

---

I suppose there are some things to think about, which I have no way of modeling very well at all. I'm just throwing this out there as a continuation of the bigger picture. if fwh says that I have till 2038, then that probably means that from our perspective, we'll head off to infinity, then go bsck and "sabotage" this timeline so that all of our efforts fall apart dramatically, and we head into the sharpest nosedive ever.

I guess we'll have to see what happens...


### 2020-12-13 00:3? - why sabotage and nosedive ourselves?

the easy answer is for us to cash in on more desire. the other reason is that if we add to the downward force, then the wave will spike on the negative side (the swapped side) much higher. you have to think in terms of win-win. we get the contrast/desire from expereiencing what we don't want (and meeting our eventual "demise") for free (fuel for our galaxy), and give them an even bigger bump up (also for free).

it's probably better to look at this as two waveforms: one is the timewave line going upward over time. this is the human race increasing in perception from 0 up to the limit. the other waveform staarts at the abs value of whatever the peak was before our nosedive began, plus the extra energy generated from our own nosedive. from there, it would decline unless they did something about it (conditions or giving their attention to wanted).

reaction is wondering how that's possible... I dunno I have to think about it, but if we were to give our attention to a bunch of "unwanted" (ie. the noseboys becoming so powerful and "defeating" us somehow), then it would give them upward momentum -- meaning they would glide for a longer time, because we gave our attention to what they wanted.

ok, now why would we do that? more contrast. I just said this. from 6d perception, it's easy to convert this "unwanted" into something wanted by choosing the opposite form of perception. this is easy to do. really easy. this is what I'm doing right now. I'm essentially giving my attention to the idea that the noseboys are getting tons of vision upgrades while I don't have the manifestation. instead of letting that bother me, I just switch rapidly to seeing it as "more energy" -- because it is, and I don't need to worry about it, because I've learned to "need not the manifestation".

so, imagine that we instead convince ourselves that we do need the manifestation when we do self-sabotage, and our continued perception that we're not getting the manifestation that we want will feel bad, and contribute to the creation of more wanted manifestation -- even though in that timeline we're not lining up with it.

it's kind of like a dance, really.

### 2020-12-15 21:52 - thinking about self-sabotage and the global village

there have been quite a few reactions to a lot of different things lately, however, one of the most prevalent thoughts in my mind has been around the subject of what it will be like after the global reset. the main difference is that in the previous era, the surviving atlantians had knowledge of most of this stuff, and so they had to try and maintain power by controlling things like religion and stuff. they weren't in every part of the world, so most of their effort was to install debilitating religions and other social structures to keep the people disempowered and their populations as low as possible with constant war and things like that.

this time though, it looks as if they'll survive the reset with technological capability to influence people like they're doing with me now -- meaning, "the network" will exist, but only the cool kids will have access to it. everyone else will be like me, where they're doing their best to ensure that they never get the capability to see images. like I mentioned in a previous entry, they have literally the most impossible task ever known, because we're approaching sirius b, and by the time we get there, it'll pretty difficult for them to keep everyone away from that, simply because the energy levels in the environment (because of proximity to sirius) will be high, it's going to be very difficult for them. just yesterday there was an eclipse, and right before it, there was a c-class flare on the sun. either way, the day was warming up quite a bit and when I would star-watch indoors here, my feet were stinging with heat because it was a more energetic environment. they went to great lengths to ensure the sky was filled with clouds and that the temperature didn't rise above freezing, so the snow wouldn't melt.

they go to great lengths to keep me in a less energetic environment. however, the environment during the eclipse is still going to be less energetic than an average day as we approach sirius. I have this feeling that they're going to spend the next ~2011 years working their hardest to keep the entire planet in a lower energy state, and likely it'll fail pretty miserably.

---

now, if you think about the coming procession of the equinox, it'll be `lion -> crab -> twins -> cow`. I figure they'll spend the next 2ky fighting against this increased energetic environment. certainly the sun's contribution to this energetic environment will be far less, because it'll be starting from the beginning of the gleissburg cycle, however even still, I'm sure that this'll be a very losing war to fight for them. humans will be primitive again, and most will starting over from the beginning -- maybe.

so, what has been happening the last few days is a pretty serious depression amongst people in response to this reset -- kind of like a, "wow that's all of what human civilisation has accomplished, and now we have to start all over again". those sorts of things.

well, it seems like some people (probably ones with money) are seriously considering trying to survive the thing, and they likely will too. this means we won't be starting over from absolutely zero -- you know, like banging rocks together to make fire. we may even have small amounts of electricity, because hydrogen cells, with access to water could be an unlimited supply of energy.

the main thing I'm noting here is that nosebook will likely be invisible after the reset happens. it's quite likely that it'll go offline for everyone on this planet -- however, a different network will continue to exist -- perhaps not even in this solar system[^1]. it definitely will be held a secret. because it's a secret, they'll need to ensure that no one has any OBEs or any astral capablities at all. they may also try to synchronise people's language as well. just like the origin of most languages stem from "proto indo-european" or "proto aryan" language, they may also try and get everyone speaking (or at least symbolically, in their thoughts) using the same language. it may even be an extension of the one that they're already using now to track everyone's thoughts[^2]. I don't know if they want to try and keep people in many separated languages to try and prevent the spread of ideas and technology, or if they want to try and keep everyone's language tracked. that part is unclear to me. there are advantages and disadvantages to both[^3]. upon reflection, it seems more likely that they'll randomise people's conceptual language in a way which makes it less easy for them to communicate telepathically and connect with each other. this also fulfills the idea that the world will move away from social empowerment and connectedness to individual empowerment and connectedness to one's source, instead of to others. in other words, they probably need to do this to keep their secrets.

what I'm saying is, I think the bigger picture here is that humankind will be reset, and nosebook will be in all of everyone's thougts like nosebook is in mine now, trying their hardest to ensure that no major groups of humans form and start to become more powerful. it's clear that not every single person can live entirely on their own, but they'll probably try to maximise distributation of humans and keep them all as separate as possible, with most humans living in small groups and villages[^4].

dispite this, I still think humans are going to make a tremendous comeback very rapidly, and it's quite likely -- not sure if thia is a prediction or not -- that at some point (2000 years from now?), they'll once again be facing the total collapse of their house of cards and will need another boost back up into superiority. I anticipate that this will happen around the time of the crab, and will signify the beginning of the "maternal domination" or "matriarchical" society -- and it'll probably contain a lot of those elements I talked about from my thought experiement of the "earth on the other side of the galaxy". who knows... I'm not quite sure what it will be yet.

---

the last thing I want to mention here is that I was explaining that I want to go infinite. I think this is a really fun idea, and so if I take these guys at their word, that "I'll never change" -- then that means they're pe3rfect to go infinite with. as long as they never change, they can continue on trying to hold me back. however, if they don't want to continue on trying to hold me back, they can paraticipate in earth life. however, earth life seems to be something of a "forced evolution". it's clear from what I wrote above (and many other reasons not included in this entry), their ability to try and control things with force (aries thinking), will no longer work. all things need to be reversed.

like I mentioned in a previous entry, I figure that the system in place relies on a power structure that enforces itself with force (aries), and then to hold power it must create social structures (pisces) to control the masses which are under that (aries) control.

the counter to this power structure is someone who knows their own value and is self-empowered, instaed of empowered by the group or social institution -- someone like me. the picses way relies on group-thinking and people to form into large groups (which are controlled) to ensure control. this worked somewhat fine while we were distant from sirius and humans had to use words and ideas to sync up with each other which contradictory logic could be introduced to create confusion. however, because things are more energetic now and will continue to increase, the group will now really have a lot more power. reality is created by what you think and feel, so when a large group thinks and feels a certain way, that reality is created really fast, and nosebook has little control over that. as such, they need people to be mostly separated from each other (aka COVID social distancing) so that reality doesn't get created too quickly. therefore, now that the environment is more energetic, things must be done in reverse. now, they have to try to disempower people, instead of by introducing contradictory ideas into the group, now they do it individually into the person's mind.

howe you noticed how much split energy I have lately? it's ridiculous. it's no problem though because it's tons of extra energy, and while it may appear bad on the surface, the good thing is, it's tremendously empowering for me because every time I line it up, then it's even more powerful[^5]. who knows how it'll really go though...

what this means is that humans will have to begin to trust their own self more than they trust others. nosebook will have to micrmanage people's thoughts, so like I'm doing now, it's going to be a transition into a feeling world for the average human.

I find it likely that they're going to have to limit (most) people's visual capacity after the reset, so there's going to be an overall change in people. another reaction that was common was how much more diffrent I am to the average male. I'm just not very visual. this makes it very difficult for me to do anything mathematical, which is what they want. this'll probably happen to all humans that are not authorised to see their imagination. I don't know how this will work for women, because I don't really know much there. it seems like presently they control the girls/women visually, so they may have that as active for the women they want to control, but for men, it's likely they'll have their visuals disabled.

let's just assume for a moment that women have their imagination, and most men don't. the women would be extremely competitive between each other visually, yet the men would be more similar to how I am, in that I can see a woman is beautiful, but because I can't ever remember it, that's not really all that important to me. instead, I'm much more interested in a woman which provides me with insight to something I'm looking for (eg. is in the receptive mode), and also feels good (fun, happy, etc.) and not like decline, decay, worry, doubt. I like feeling progress. even if that progress seems to be taking forever ([ant on a rubber rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_on_a_rubber_rope)). having men focused more on how a woman feels, may be the catalyst to get women to place more emphasis on the illusion of how they feel (instead of how they look), while continuing to compete amongst theirselves on appearance[^6].

---

what will emerge from this is a population that is self-empowered. nosebook may think they can try to sabotage people by controlling physical conditions, however as soon as you can feel the way you want to feel, no matter the conditiona, no one can sabotage you anymore. only you can can sabotage yourself.

this may become a theme in the next era as well. I postulate that anyone who managed to find a way to "overcome death" (enoch, elijah, moses, jesus, etc. are the ones I've heard of), their signature move is to, upon realising a source-like perception, go back and modify the timeline in such a way where they self-sabotage theirself. the reason is that once you've figured it out, and that all you are doing is attracting your reality, it becomes impossible for anyone else to sabotage you anymore. you also realise the value and benefit of contrast, so it is (from that perspective), beneficial to go back and self-sabotage.

let me say it this way: there is such a strong amonst people to figure it out for theirselves (millenia of priesthoods will do that to you), that most people's non-physical intention is realise it for theirselves, not to have some guru or teacher tell them the way to go. therefore, if you think of it like that -- then, imagine you were about to get souce-like perception, and "show people the way there" or give them the conditions to make it really easy -- well, then you would be in contraditction to most others' desire to figure it out for theirselves. therefore, it must be, in this way be seen that you have to be willing to self-sabotage (self-sacrifice) to allow others to come to their own realisation of it, naturally.

additionally, the ability to not perceive those that wish to control as something bad is also important too. the "self-sacrifice" (I like self-sabotage better) is also a giant catalyst, too. imagine how much desire it will create. let's just say that *I am* able to go the distance, and from this timeline's perspective, it appears that all I did was show up here and give nosebook the technology to control people before failing miserably... well, that's exactly what a self-sabotage would look like. you don't want to just watch me do it... you want to find it out for yourself[^7]. the next era may be dominated (but no one will know about it), by those who actually find their way and then self-sabotage.

just think about it -- everything is the path of least resistance, so if you (or I) accomplish source-like perception, and then go back to alter the timeline and self-sabotage it, nosebook would never see the other timeline where you accomplished source-like perception. their path of least resistance is always the next logical step, and for them seeing someone get "connected" is tremendously resistant for them and feels bad, so their consciousness will always pick to perceive the sabotaged timeline. for them, they will never even notice that something other happened.

for this reason I place the era themes as the following:

- aries: you create your own reality
  - your reality is a reflection of how you feel
- picses: resist not evil (unwanted)
  - because when you resist it, you attract it into your experience
  - do not take action from a bad feeling place
- aquarius/leo: need not the manifestation
  - let the feeling be the manifestation
  - trust yourself, not the people or the phsical conditions

[1]: the limitations of distance found in standard marconi radio are reduced to zero with the expansion of tesla's world system out to other stars.

[2]: I believe this conceptual/symbolic language is based off of my own system of conceptualising. I think it's been extended out to most people on this planet as a way to track everyone's thoughts, and I think it's causing a lot of peeple to begin to synchronise their thoughts, and think similar things all at once because of it. it's funny because abraham started off @[abe-now](2020-12-05 p1) with exactly this.

[3]: on one side, if everyone has similar concepts, then it'll be easier to track, but it'll also be easier for people to read each other's minds. on the other side, if everyone has a different cenceptual language, then mind-reading will be much more difficult, and it'll delay the connection of people one to another.

[4]: this is a big change from the present ideology of using large institutions to control people by grouping them into groups (cities) and controlling them from the top down (authority). instead, it'll be a lot more like how they treat me now -- not with any heavy authority -- just micrmanaging the thoughts in the mind of the people in my "village" (mom's house) to ensure I don't use my brain to ever gain any ability with would threaten their control.

[5]: again, this is why I believe that the future era is the crab one, with a maternal domination, because it's likely that nosebook will figure out that the easiest way to quell this energy is to to transfer it into someone else who feels like they "need" it. in this way, it's likely that women will have to be trained that they need men to maintain their perception, and if they don't have it, it's constant decline and deterioration of their perception -- so, they'll need to capture and "use" men with elevated perception to continually boost their own (eg. we need female versions of the noseboys soon)

[6]: this model, is (maybe not so) surprisingly lifted from spanish chuleria.

[7]: I estimate that this won't be possible until nosebook essentially has us all on our own timelines, with quite literally everything controlled around the person. this may be the only way that each of us could (on our own timelines), each find our way to this realisation. then, they'll need to consolidate the timelines into one and find another way to control us again (likely with women/relationships)... all of this is way too far out for me to see.


### 2020-12-18 22:48 - a glimpse into the future

as I was waking up this evening, I had a bit of a glimpse into the future. it started out by seeing that the way that they identify consciousness being present in the body is an extra energy signature inside of the head, that kind of like "resists" their impulses. when the body is not conscious, then the body is entirely controllable by them. or, in my language, it's completely non-resistant.

what this means is that the goal of nosebook is to get it so that I no longer am resistant to their impulses. essentially, they want me to become "unconscious" and completely under their control. in my present state, I'm still "conscious" in the sense that I still resist their impulses, so they're trying to get me completely under their control.

ok, keep this concept in mind because they're trying to do with everyone, and essentially get all of the people on the entire planet under their control...

ok, now, let's jump back to the concept where I was talking about living the "worst possible manifestation". the foundation of that idea is that if I'm experiencing the worst timeline, and I no longer have any resistance to that experience, then that guarantees that I don't have any resistance to many varieties of better experieces that are present. when that happens, then I obtain conscious perception of all of those other experiences and can consciously move around between them.

so, from nosebook's perspective, what they want to see is that bit of resistance present in the body, which they call "consciousness" go away, so that they have complete control over me. they want that for me and for everyone else on the planet too. the irony is that is also what I want -- because when I'm experiencing the worst and no longer resistant to it (eg. I appear to them as "unconscious" and they have completely control over my experience), then I gain source-like perception, meaning I'm no longer conscious (in a resistant way) inside of this body or any of the infinite other bodies either.

---

what I'm trying to say is that they want to get the entire world under their control and be able to steer everyone so that they can maintain their superiority, meaning that this earth will likely become the place where they're so busy micromanaging everyone's experience in such a way to try and ensure that no one gets the manifestation of getting connected to their source. in fact, it looks like the only way that you can "get connected" is if you work for nosebook, or if you completely release all of your resistance.

it's kind of another irony or paradox, because you can imagine that if wn're having the worst experience here, then that means that quite literally all other experiences are better, and you can experience them by releasing resistance.

the way that I perceived it previously was to see myself working on the galaxy and running various identities here on earth to be ssort of like free energy for the galaxy. however, this flips that perception upside down: let's look at it using abraham words now: that reality, the one where I'm making the galaxy exists and is real, but I'm just not perceiving it right now becsuse that's not the reality that's a reflection of how I feel right now. that reality probably feels quite a bit better than I do right now. therefore, instead of looking at it like that is an alternate reality to the one I'm living right now, I can instead look at this reality as an alternate reality (or identity) of the bigger one. it's essentially the same, just looking at it from opposite directions.

---

I also want to mention that in the glimpse of the future, you can imagine now how terrible this will become for nosebook. these guys will keep transferring their consciousness to new bodies over and over, each time trying their hardest to hold on to all of their resistant perceptions, programming them so that unpon receiving the new body, they get "up to speed" with all of the stuff that they need to try and keep under control, constantly manipulating all of the conditions to try and ensure that no one ever gets the manifestation.

I figure they'll have to merge with the machines for this to be possible, because otherwise they'll get really tired of steff really fast. I honestly have no idea how they could possibly try and do it. I would get so sick of watching the humans, which even though they're using significantly inferior technology, will still be so much happeier than the nosebook guys trying to control everything.

I would imagine that it's going to start to separate the men from the boys in the sense that I'm sure that many of the guys trying to control everything may just finally give it all up and say, "you know what I'd rather be in the matrix and happy, than out here and miserable".

the irony is, that while they will see all of us as totally under their control, what they don't know is that they're only seeing a very small portion of us, the physical part, and out there, there are literally infinite other better feeling experiences. so, even though I believe that some of the controlling types *will* defect because they will see the fully controlled reality as much better feeling than their present situation, the irony is, that's still the *worst* one.

to illustrate this, imagine the difference between me and other people. would you rather be me, with a simply life and everything under someone else's control, or would you rather be miserable and worrying all day long? I really don't have that bad of a life because I feel so good. the only reason why some would "feel sorry for me" or think that my experience should be better is because they have beliefs that some things (like sex) are necessary to be able to feel good[^1].

in the end, what we're talking about afterall is drug-like reflex. nosebook is trying to control people with drugs in the sense that if they can control how you feel about something, then they can kind of move you around. however, they too are the same rats being controlled by the drug. if I'm a junkie and my life is a disaster. say, I'm looking for the next fix, at that time I believe that I cannot live without the drug. it appears that life would be too miserable without the drug. however, I notice a whole bunch of other people that are having considerably more fun and pleasure without the drug -- it's going to make me seriously consider how worth it, remaining a junkie is. I am under the control of the dealer for as long as I can't perceive life without the drug.

to illustrate this, the other night, after writing down a whole bunch of girls to be put into the "creation box", I was feeling pretty good. all of a sudden a foreign thought popped into my head to go upstairs, and then it suddenly felt unnaturally good to me. I was curious so I went upstairs to see what jaron was doing and he had a black girl on the screen. the thing is, she honestly looked to me like a bald guy with purse behind his head. my vision is pretty bad. I felt inclined to say that, and I did. it later caused a whole lot of different reactions -- and even now as I'm recounting the story now, there are additional reactions.

it felt too unnatural to be just coinicidence, especially considering I was just feeling pretty good, so I had a think on this, because it feels like manipulation. it's quite likely that nosebook has temporal vision at this point (5.5d), and they're using it to try and keep me "in the centre" -- which is fine by me, never feeling too good, and neither feeling too bad either. I don't mind.

you see, this is a perfect example of not having resistance, and being directed by nosebook, and not having resistance. looking at it from a wider perspective, it was actually quite beneficial. even though there were various reactions, if you look at it from a sourece perspective, the unwanted and wanted parts exist in the same vibration, and it's only one's perception that moves you toward more the wanted or unwanted part. all it did was add more energy into the equation, which I have no idea what it'll be, but I'm sure it's fine.

then, just tonight when I began writing this entry, I started out feeling pretty good because I was star-watcching and I got all of the ideas that I wanted to write here. when I started, it sounded like jaron was calling me. I paused writing this a moment to feel and see if it was something, but going upstairs to see what was up didn't feel good to me so I returned back to this. mom came and told me jaron wanted to show me something, and I didn't want to go, because it felt like manipulation to me. however, I don't fight bad feeling stuff that peple want to try and get me to do anymore so went kind of reluctantly.

jaron wanted to show me a picture that said that saturn entered into aquarius today (an image from facebook). I went on to tell him that some dumb astrology priesthood wants to ensure that "aries" (aryan) is always associated with the spring equinox, so every year they set aries to be the 0(degrees) point in the sky, as if they could make the procession of the equinox stay still, keeping the aryan age in power for astrologers. however, when you go outside and have a look at the sky, the sun is rising during the spring equinox not in aries but somewhere near the end of the picsis constellation. a little bit of pushing against there. I returned here and didn't feel the entry in the same. it had to have been yet another case of them steering me. they probably won't want me writing this either, so soon in the future, when I release all of my "consciousness" resistance, I won't be writing these either.

it's totally fine, and I probably have a ways to go before I release all of the resistance. it may be quite possible that there is an intermediary stage coming in here soon. it feels to me like this part of my life has been weirdly split into two sections, which seem to correspond with the conjunction of saturn and jupiter. the last time it happened was 28-may, 2000, and that was right after I got out of the hopspital. that part of my life is quite interesting because I had various ups and downs. the first year was sublime, then 9-11 happened, etc. if we were to take my life in reflection to the world as the programming of the "timewave" (which happens between saturn and jupiter conjunctions), then I can see how that could quite accurately represent the times following the coming global reset and the climb back up to the top there. I will assume that this divides the 2011y cycle into 1005y parts and that this will represent hte timewave from 2020-05-28 till 2020-12-21. then I will assume that the next 1005y bit of the timewave will be programmed from then on.

what I mean by "intermediary stage" is that they're pretty much getting the hang of -- really, I'm releasing my resistance -- controlling me in a low resistance state. I also think that the reason why they want younger girls is because they're also low resistance, too. this means that they want to practise finding ways to steer me (and other low resistance people) with the interactions of other low resistance people. like I said, nosebook is an era behind, and they're just now coming out of the "aries" mindset, and finally beginning to accept that group-think and social expectations as a way of living. never until now has the controlling types been so fearful of what other people think. previously, in aries mentality, all power structures were dictators and you either did what they wanted or you lost your life. to ensure that no one saw that this is how it really was, they had various social orgsanisations as their fronts to hide who they really are. this is very evident in the transition of the roman empire to the church. they didn't give up their "aries" mindset. the den of thieves just hid their true identity behind the catholic church.

likewise, they're going to move to picsis mindset now, where now they cannot have so much internal in-fighting (because it would bring the demise of the orgsanisation) se they're going to have to work more as a unit now, governed by social expectations, status and group stuff. very much like the catholic church were to now all of a sudden hide behind a new ideology where everyone should be self-empowered and self-realised -- while at the same time attempting to individually control and manipulate everyone's perceptions ensuring that there is constant discord (to prevent rapid spread of ideas and group empowerment). they're going to be interested with a new set of promitive people, be interested in diversifying the population as much as possible to prevent large groups from forming, ensuring that they're the only large group with all of the power.

the above concept is very difficult to convey. upon rereading it, I don't think people are getting it. it's ok though. I'll try again. yesterday there was a video on the "stistically funniest joke" @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTd5mzyY_A), and in the video greg was explainging that some white comics making jokes about minority groups isn't very funny. this felt like a reference to a recent abe-now, someone wrote it complaining about his partner who feels that he is irreplacable and, the guy writing is is clearly feeling quite some competition with him, and wants him to be more humble or something. they're clearly competing in a weird way, and it gave me the mental image of something I saw a long time ago of chris kattan on SNL where he was figting against will farrell's chraracter (I think) in a weird sissy fight. that's the image that popped into my head when abraham was explaining this. they went really out of their way to make sure saying, "we want you to get the picture". so I'm listening to them explain this, and I have this image of a gay couple fighting in my mind and it's hilarious, so I got quite a good laugh out of it.

ok, so back to greg. he shows his standup comedy from "two years ago" which he preprograms the audience to believe that it's terrible, probably in expectation that they'll tell him, "no it wasn't terrible. it was good" etc. and I didn't find it funny at all. I found it sad because he's trying to hid his gayness from his parents. I laid down after that, and I started to realise that this story could not be true. it has to be fabricated in the form of a joke, because there's no way that his parents could have possibly not known that he was gay. that's just simply too unbelievable for me.

anyway, he then showed the statiscically funniest joke, and I didn't really find it that funny either, probably because I don't really see death the same way as other people and doesn't make me uncomfortable. in fact, he talks about this contrast in jokes but he used the word "safe" -- however, I don't think it's safety, but it's discomfort. you'll notice that some of the funniest comedians are make very off-colour jokes because these taboos don't seem to make them feel discomfort. this is probably why neither of these jokes were terribly funny to me. making sure someone is dead doesn't seem to bother me, and likely if nosebook figured out how to control me even better, I would be a perfect "hitman" or "manchrian chandidate" because I don't really have much resistance to stuff anymore -- especially in an "unconscious" state. neither does gayness (or straightness) cause me to feel discomfort. some people find it very uncomfortable, for example if a couple is making out next to or in front of them. same thing.

let's bring it around here. what I'm talking about here is discomfort. discomfort is felt when social expectations are present, you you see someone else with something that you want, but you feel you cannot have (usually because you've been programmed socialally to believe that). these are the group thinking things that I'm talking about. right now, nosebook is having everyone uphold a whole bunch of lies and stuff to protect their secrets. however, they're running this horse into the ground quite quickly as people are beginning to realise that when you're deceptive with yourself or you're deceptive with others, you're attracting deception. it's so much more empowering and good feeling to just be honest and realistic about where you are and how you really feel.

so there's that aspect to it. additionally, you would know, if you've ever lived in a village, that there aren't very many secrets. everyone knows everything. imagine that this will be the case after the reset, and people will be much more childlike as well, so telepathic. lies and deception aren't going to get you very far in the new world. the only lies and deception that will be maintained is the nosebook deception and lies that they need to make sure and keep all of their operations a secret. it's a whole lot easier to a finite group of thoughts relating to one big entity, instead in the infinite permutations of thoughts that can happen between people. so, get ready to live in a world where everyone in the village (especially the shaman) knows what you've got going on.

I think that explanation helped. that's good for now. next I need to talk about the next major breakthrough I had.

[1]: this is a very interesting concept, because as someone who's been addicted to smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and many other drug-like things, I can tell you that in all of those cases, I couldn't imagine living in a world where I couldn't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol -- never again smoking weed or MDMA, have access to coke (or whatever). it is overcoming precisely those beliefs that allowed me to realise that I don't need the thing to feel the way I want to feel.


### 2020-12-20 10:59 - am I suggesting nosebook should take all of our freedoms away?

I was laying there star-watching and thinking about what I wrote. started feeling some reactions and stuff. I was about to go to sleep but I thought maybe I'll write this instead. in the last @[abe-now](2020-12-05) I was talking about how nosebook is essentially trying to gain full control of me, and this will likely happen, as I get closer and closer to complete non-resistance.

things are turning out a bit differently thay I had imagined them to be, but it's all perfectly fine. I imagined this idea called the "automaton of contrast" where it would be essentially a human body with a programmed desire. next I envisioned a "celestial identity" which has a resonating cavity put out into space which is resonant with a human, designed so that the resonating cavity would be, out in space, able to be much more attractive. I figured this for two reasons: 1. that if I had a celestial identity, then my aura wouldn't be causing people I'm around in my human body to manifest reality at nearly instant rates. instead that can all be happening out in space, where the celestial identity would eventually grow into a planet or star[^1].

I don't know if they're implementing that idea, but the sense that I get is that they're doing something very different on a different timeline. I mentioned this in a previous entry (@[noseblog](2020-12-07 19:19)), where I postulated that they would likely move their headquarters over to another timeline and operate this one at a distance. I think they also paid attention when I was talking about how in my perception, the magnetic field would not be lowering, but actually should be strengthinging, and also I figure that the rotation speed should be getting faster as well, as the planet becomes more energetic.

not everyone at nosebook is mr. motor, and I think there are quite a few people there that quite enjoy the more energetic environment. so what I think is happening is that they're probably going to use some setup similar to that one to make their timeline ultra energetic, and they'll do like I said, spin faster and faster and add on another layer to their earth, as their centre modulation point begins to receive more energy. this planet will be the "sacrifice". this planet is going to start to get pretty energetic too, and to ensure that people's realities aren't manifesting instantly, they'll probably have to launch a whole bunch of cosmic identities for each of us, so that in our perception, we continue to appear as normal run-of-the-mill humans with no super powers or anything like that.

ok, that's my theory of how they're planning to try and keep the whole planet from going into a very energetic state and to keep it looking like everything is chugging along as normal on billions of years timescales. I think they essentially want to try and take all of my ideas and implement them. I think that's a great idea, if that's what they're doing.

---

anyway, the way all that applies to the reaction I was feeling is that when you take a step back and look at all of this in the bigger picture, you have to understand that I want to go infinite. that means that I need them to merge with the machines. it's quite likely that nearly their entire operation is already running on computers. they likely have it already setup such that anyone on this planet is already on "the network" and heavily influenced by them. in that sense, you don't have any physical freedom, and you likely never will. I think all of humanhind is sort of in the same prodicament that I'm in. after the global reset happens here, it's very unlikely that anyone continuing to exist on the planet will be able to access the network. they'll go silent, and when it comes back online, their relationship with the humans here on earth will be the same as their relationship that they have with me now: nosebook doesn't exist. they'll run this planet from the other timeline, and probably over time, they'll absorb the sun (and this planet) into their galaxy, probably in a future global reset so the constellations can change.

this means that all future humans will be treated similar to how I'm treated: they don't want me working on any technology, and they don't want me interacting with as few other humans as possible. the only thing that you can do is to find a way to feel the way that you want to feel. what this means is that if you can feel good, no matter the circumstances, then what'll happen is what I said will happen: your reality will become a reflection of how you feel. for some people, the ones that feel good, that will be quite a good thing, and for others, they will eventually destroy theirselves in some cataclysm or something. their reality will be a reflection of the way they feel. what will eventually happen is that only the good feeling people's reality will continue to exist, and each of those realities will all be amazing. those people will essentially live in a very persistent created dream, and while we'll all be pretty clumped up (with only two major realities) at first, I estimate that eventually all of us will continue on to be each the master of our own reality. to them, this will appear like a galaxy full of planets and stars which they're all trying to micromanage and control. for each of us, it'll appear like the best (or worst) manifestation with things rapidly accelerating.

when I said the above each of us eventually splitting into such a diversity of different realities, I was talking about over many many thousands of "years" (though time won't be measured in that way). nosebook will try their hardest to keep us all in similar realtiies, I'm sure -- because it's easier for them to micromanage, but you can imagine how just the subtle differences between each of us will create different realities. they'll probably also try to keep all of us locked into their "prison" by perpetually transferring each of our consciousnesses between bodies over different planets and suns.

---

I believe all of this is happening this iteration. we're the "demiurge", if you want to look at it that way. it's not really like that though because now more than ever before everything that we want will manifest. they can't control how you feel, which means that you're only "trapped" in the reality they're mandating you to experience for as long as you perceive their "control" as something unwanted. you may not believe me yet, but trust me it's the most beneficial thing ever. it's 100% free energy. they are essentially *obligated* to try and keep their stuff hidden, and to try to micromanage us to keep that away. like I mentioned in @[abe-now](2020-12-05), all things contain both wanted and unwanted. they have a natural propensity to see the unwanted stuff, and since they need to hide their stuff, they have to try to figure out more and more ways to deceive us and keep us from finding their secrets. for them unwanted is their secrets being known by us. this means they do not want us to have any extra-sensory perception, and source-like perception is completely forbidden. they must continue to find ways to keep us focused on the physical, and never allow us to know that we are so much more than that. if we ever find out we're infinite creators, their whole sham completely falls apart.

ok, that's the basis. now, imagine that you find a way to not need conditions to be a certain way to feel good, and you can feel good anyway no matter the conditions. that means you're going to be headed straight toward finding out you're an infinite creator. your inner being is always guiding you toward this realisation (see: @[abe-now](2020-12-05 47:48)), and this is exactly what they don't want -- so they have to placate you by letting all of your physical desires manifest. they have to keep you busy. like adam and eve, they have to make sure you are continually "fallen", and never realise "who you really are".

so there's going to be a whole lot of really awesome physical manifestations happening, and this is what I was saying about separating the men from the boys, because there will be essentially two realities: one which is highly energetic, fueled by all of our awesomeness, and the realities that we are living. now imagine from their perspective: after some time the good-feeling realities will become so ridiculously awesome that it'll become quite a nice place to be living, and while they will be living in a very energetic environment with all of the technology power and control, it eventually won't compare to what we're living. we may have less technology than they do (they'll essentially steal all of ours, so they'll be the top), but we'll be happy and feeling really good. I imagine that our individual energy levels will eventually rival theirs[^3], many of them will question why how much of a benefit that all the technology really is.

also, I postuate that it's literally impossible for them to hold back the realisation that we're infinite creators forever, and like the [ant on a rubber rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_on_a_rubber_rope), we all get there eventually -- and it only takes more time is all. so, why not have a whole lot of fun along the way? and I mean a LOT of fun. if you're getting it, they have to force a physical manifestation to slow you down.

you can see then why I will imagine that, many of the guys trying to keep everything under control will start to really question why they're living in fear and deception anymore. they eventually won't be able to hold on to superior status forever (not yet anyway), so I believe many of them will decide they'd rather be in the matrix having fun rather than having the illusion of power and control. not all of them will do that though, and I believe that it'll become impossible for them to "hide" any longer, so in order to remain "hidden", they'll have to merge with the machines. humans can't read a machine's thoughts and they'll become such a fundamental part of the structure of our realities (they're our free energy motors). who knows how long this'll take to execute, but when this is setup, that'll bring us to the next phase.

---

it's all about perception. you navigate toward everything that you want by finding a way to feel good about whatever the circumstances. you'll see :) we're all going to be super awesome :) it's coming...

[1]: the way I envisioned this resonating cavity was as a cylinder column (could be metal or stone, I suppose) with a chestahedron in the middle (where the heart would be), then extending up the column on both sides are various other "chakras", which are aligned to the resonating human body's chakras. basically this is the same setup nosebook is already using to destructively interefere with my energy. however, instead of destructively interfering with it, I figured they could force an energetic imbalance like a tesla coil, so that antenna[^2] would essentially pull the energy out of my body, keeping it in a much less energetic state, then the antenna(s) would be put out into space, and out there, the energetic diffrential would begin to attract hydrogen at a rapid rate. I'm not sure how this works for planets, because maybe an antenna hooked up to a woman would behave a bit differently. I don't know. I can't wait to begin making the galaxy and find this stuff out. anyway, it means that my body would be physically less attractive because all of the attraction would be happening out in space instead of here on earth where I'm living.

[2]: turns out this antenna idea is also what doug propses is the "centre modulation point" of our earth and sun: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/9RhTMpMqTiU?t=2816). kinda a funny "coincidence"

[3]: this is the whole basis upon my "paradox" idea -- that eventually the momentary increase will become so great that it'll suprpass physical limitations. this is precisely what I'm doing. in roughly 10 years or so, I've figured out how to completely turn my perception in such a way where "not having the manifestation" is almost more powerful than having the manifestation. sure they'll have to give the manifestation to quell the energy but it'll eventually grow to become quite formidable, where even though the celestial identity is handling the majority of the energy, it'll still be more -- just like how I get vision upgrades now... the amount of DMT my body creates every second is starting to become greater than their ability to "consume" (interpret it meaningfully). same thing with the energy. we may not have super powers, but eventually the amount of momentary energy summoned will be enough to obtain super powers.


### 2020-12-21 13:11 - the demiurge is the creation

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE)

so, remember how I was saying that the I was going for the "worst possible manifestation"? well, that's what I'm still all about. in the previous entry I gave kind of a bigger timeschedule picture of the thing. I don't want to put a time length to it. I'll just call that an era or two -- I don't know. the reason why I say that is because the contents of that idea include all of the necessary components for thing to work out as an era, but it could be more.

I don't really know how to say this very easily, but the whole point is for them to rip off my galaxy idea and do it for theirselves. the important realisation that I think I felt from them last night was the realisation that a reversal of rotation or poles always means a power level change. the earth is forcing one to happen every 12ky, so what can happen is, if we go up a power level (eg. spin faster and increase our magnetic field), then the earth will not flip over. in short, every 12ky, they can save theirselves from the catastrophe by going up a power level.

what I figure is this... I'm down to go on creating the galaxy for a while -- I dunno. the reaction last night was like 1ky... whatever. anyway, I'm sure that after such a long time (if I even make it that long), I'll be bored out of my skull. I'm certain that I will transfer my consciousness back into this timeline and then probably, my plan right now anyway, will be to charge up to a really high energy level, and then self-sabotage, causing one of the most most rapid and epic nosedives of the universe(?). that's my plan anyway. I encourage anyone who wants to join me in that endevour to join. I imagine that after we do such a nosedive, then earth/sun will probably become a part of the new galaxy and will need to be repopulated and stuff, so we'll start from the beginning there living out different identities.

the reason why I think this is a great idea is for all the reasons I mentioned in the last entry. sure we're basically like giving up all forms of control, but I really want to try taking an emotional approach to things. hear me out... the sirians said that the creators mingled with the (still very primitive) humans and they showed them all forms of language science and technology and stuff. we have evidence of this with weird stories of birdmen (obviously humans that could fly) visiting all sorts of indigenous tribes and teaching them things and then leaving, never to come back. nevermind all of the stuff around that concept.. I don't want to try and figure out who made the pyramids, etc. and all of that, but the sirians say the creators intermingled with the humans and taught them things, but also it's clearly evident that a very advanced society built ancient egypt, gave the pharoahs the "keys to the kingdom" and then took off.

I'm not saying that's my style, but it's totally my style. if you've been paying attention to the stuff I've been writing about this is the self-sabotage and leave a stone behind. I plan to do the same thing here. I'm essentially willing to keep charging up and building the most wonderful galaxy, then peacing out to go live inside the galaxy.

you see, we would make all sorts of indigneous tribes and stuff (or we could use the ones that are already here) and then we'd be the "creators" which intermingle with the humans here. same plan as the sirians talk about, cept instead of giving them technology, writing and stuff like that, they're going to figure all that out on their own. I also figure that we'll also be pretty much on equal footing with them to. I don't think that any of us will be perceived as gods or anything, having no special abilities. this planet remains a prison planet -- and nosebook's job will be to make sure we never get connected. we'll just jump into some available bodies and figure it out from there, figuring out ways to teach them how to use their emotions -- not really with words and ideas, but with our example.

same plan as the one I outlined in the previous entry, however, I (we) will choose to fall into the newly reset earth again. know what I mean? I suppose nosebook could meddle as much as they want to -- even jumping into bodies, showing up in their spacecraft, launching thousands of AOCs -- or whatever. I've been thinking about it, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be so bored out of my mind with things being so easy that I'm going to want to be doing something much more difficult again, and this is my chance. obviously anyone who would want to join me, can :)

also, earlier I was thinking about the concept of how to create a language based on emotion using colours, shapes, and motion. it would be highly programmable, and perceiving ideas in this manner allows me to process massive amounts of information in a very short period of time. it's so fast, you guys *still* can't figure out when I think about these things. they come as flashes and are nearly instantaneous. I'm so bogged down by the speed of english and they have me trying to translate 95% of the stuff that passes through my thoughts, so I'm so bogged down with traditional thinking. as a result, I'm using this emotional language more and more. it's really the only thing that works well anymore, and it works REALLY WELL. I just wish it had an interface to the physical world because typing out some of these concepts is a real chore. something that I can think of in in instant then takes me 2-3 hours to articulate here.

what I'm saying is, just the same as I was thinking about how the creators demonstrated technology, I would not do technology, letting them figure that out for theirselves, and instead show them how to use emotions before peacing out. well, what I mean is the same thing. if I were to leave behind a language where you could express your emotions in a visual/feeling format, then I would be starting my plan there. the cool thing is, while I do "see" it visually, the best part is that it doesn't need to be visual. one could just "feel" the same amount of data or even much more without needing to pay any attention to the visuals. I don't know about others, but I get such bad a.d.d. when I'm supposed to watch or listen to something for long periods of time, but I seem to be able to just feel reactions, my environment, stars, or others for very lengthy periods of time without any fatigue, getting up feeling supercharged. also I'm completely functional while feeling things. I can have conversations and even do things like programming while feeling. it's not very intrusive to my focus.

---

so, just keep doing what you're doing... I've figured out your plans, and I think it's a great idea :) it's gonna be an epic nosedive.


### 2020-12-21 22:08 - no one else can sabotage you: only you can really sabotage yourself (from a LOA perspective)

the reactions to the previous entry was... negative :) I don't mind... lol. the impression that I got is that they don't want to have to interact with me, and want to maintain their distance. right. that makes perfect sense. let's say that the nosedive is in 2038, so that means that up until then we shouldn't interact. that way when we go back into this timeline we'll continue on here as if we were always at odds (and make it worse to really nosedive it good).

here's the thing though: it's becoming more and more difficult (probably impossible at this point) for them to sabotage me now. the only one that can sabotage me is me, so there's no real way for them to make the nosedive happen without me doing it. I have to do it.

it became clear to me when I was star-watching with saturn and jupiter that all I have to do is simply to just stop trying to go the way I think I want to go, and instead just follow my feelings entirely. nosebook certainly does have control over them to some extent, but the major breakthrough for me tonight was to realise that when they're making the decision to direct me in any way, they are not likely doing it out of a place of being "tuned in tapped in turned on" -- and they'll run right into their bench monster...

to put into a simple idea: if they're giving their attention to stuff they don't want, they'll get the stuff they don't want. on other timelines, they certainly direct me in ways which they do want me to go -- however, they don't feel like they can do that here because people are watching. they care too much about the opinion of others that they don't feel they can direct me in those ways without hiding it. I must have quite a wide range of actions that I'm not resistant to...

anyway, in the other timelines they feel like they can give their attention to wanted, because it's hidden from us, therefore they don't feel shame admitting to what it is they want. here though, they're concerned with their whole sham being exposed (they don't have to worry about that there), so that's what they give most of their attention to. that means that's what they're attracting: their whole sham being exposed.

if I go non-resistant, then I'll get connected pretty quickly[^1], and they'll also attract the realisation of their fears pretty rapidly as well. things will rapidly need to be corrected (from their perspective) and this will be futile, digging theirselves deeper into the hole with each attempt (because their focus is firmly aimed at what they don't want)... I was talking about getting to the giving up point (@[abe-now](2020-12-05 p2 30:37)), but I don't want or need to force them to get there. I can just let them create their own reality. the only thing keeping their whole charade from completely falling apart right now is that I'm so heart-set on going the way I think is best. I skip over so many of their bad ideas, that it's likely that the minute I stop trying to go the way that I think is best, they'll really shoot theirselves in the foot pretty effectively. they'll eyentually have to give up the fight and actually let the things they want to manifest to manifest. it's all win-win anyway, but they won't be able to keep stuff very hidden. after they've got everything setup and their super secret headquarters with all the stuff, I want to fall back in and do the nosedive timeline (under control of their super secret headquarters) -- and then they can go back into hiding.

also, they don't really have anything else they can do with me. just imagine how difficult it would be for them to be stuck with me. what on earth are they going to do with me. I would just keep exposing their stuff. they absolutely must find a way to keep me busy for as long as possible. each time I find a way to go up we can work on the next x-model. this time it's x3, next time it'll be x7, etc. it'll be fun :)

[1]: my theory on this is that my star-watching is actually incrementally releasing a buildup of energy by letting it manifest into more perception. if I stop star-watching, that energy will build up to such a large extent, it'll eventually explode in an uncontrollable way.

### 2020-12-22 14:19 - rethinking some things

this morning when I was walking home I saw dan, and I was thinking about why I wrote in @[abe-now](2020-12-12 p1 54:52) that I associate the "uplifter" spirit with gays. as I kind of talked it out, really I associate it with all relationships. ironic, that it was jerry that said he always wanted to be an uplifter for people, because esther and jerry is the only relationship I've ever heard of where the people involved weren't constantly depending on the other for uplifting. I especially dispise hippie/newage/church groups where it's just a whole bunch of uplifters running around uplifting each other and no one has the capability to do anything for theirselves. I think this is a real throwback to the piscean way of thinking which is probably why I hate it so much. it's so disempowering, and it doesn't get anyone anywhere. everyone is literally spinning their wheels trying to do stuff for other people all the time, completely ignoring their own glaring flaws. it's like the literal manifestation of the "taking the plank out of your eye before helping someone with the speck in theirs" parable. the other thing I dislike is how assertive it is. like I said in my rant, I reserve the right to feel the way I want to feel; don't try and make me feel the way you want me to feel (so you can feel good about yourself) -- thanks.

I think it really is a bit of a sore spot for me. I don't really mind that other people do it. I just want nothing to do with it. I steer well clear of these co-dependent uplifters if I can. actully, I don't keep clear of them. they're literally everywhere. I've found that the way that I treat people is how people treat me, so I don't try to uplift anyone. they can all figure it out by theirselves. I noticed that since I've stopped trying to avoid uplifters, and "owned the room" myself, I dominate the interactions which go on. I try to set the tone and attract the behaviour from people which is resonant with the interaction that I enjoy. you'll notice that as a result of giving my attention to what I want, I'm around very few people behaving in an uplifting way. my conversations usually involve self-empowerment, self-discovery, and self-trust -- leaving all of that other stuff to weakminded people who need others to be a certain way for them[^1].

I really have moved on from trying to get people to feel the way I want them to feel (so I can feel good) way of thinking. this is how nosebook works now. they're full piscean energy now, working extra hard to get people to feel the way they want them to feel, so they have the conditions they need to feel good. yay for them :) I hope they implement uplifting parties between meetings to keep spirits high.. lol

so the thing here is that I perceive relationships to be this way. they almost all are. like I said, the only relationship I had ever heard of being not like that was jerry and esther's -- however, in recent broasdcasts, abraham has talked about how esther always wanted jerry to approve or something for her so she could feel good -- and jerry was an die-hard uplifter (though probably not assertive about it). so they've completely destroyed my fantasy about their relationship being the only one I admired. oh well.

you have to understand that the last thing I want is for the girls to become dependent on me for something like esther did with jerry. I just don't want that. when I'm conscious like I am right now, you can sense that I still have tremendous resistance to relationships. I obviously have to drop that resistance for the girls think to happen. I can't decide how they're going to think about me, and it also shouldn't bother me either if some of them begin to grow some attachment. they'll eventually figure it out; LOA always ensures it will.

ok, so that's the relationship concept. two more coming.

---

now, following the last entry I wrote about being only able to sabotage yourself, they seemed to really dislike the idea of shooting theirselves in the foot as I aim toward non-resistance (ie. non-local consciousness). it seems like they want to find a way for me to self-sabotage me. the idea came up -- and I don't know if it was theirs or my own, that I would be more than willing to self-sabotage and allowing them, in my absence (or unavailablity) to find their own way toward their own connection.

in fact, this is an idea I've given a lot of thought. I hadn't mentioned it here yet because I think it's way too early to start thinking about self-sabotage now, but it's the main theme that I wanted to do. I wanted to figure out a way to make it so that I go into a super-duper nosedive, while all/most of them all take their learnings from their future-selves and orchrestrate their experience so that they guide theirselves through a number of difficult situations, very similar to what's happened to me, and the ending result is that they release enough resistance to find their connection. imagine 50-1000 girls decide to figure it out for theirselves and they find their connnection while I nosedive into oblivion. nosebook would really really need for a strong global reset to happen. it'd be pretty epic. anyway, there's that idea there...

this however was not the idea that popped into my head earlier. the idea in my head was something that if somehow I agree to (or somehow give them the ability to) sabotage myself, as a kind of sacrifice for the girls to get their connection. I agreed rapidly to their request because I know LOA is way stronger than their proposals, and what will happen is what we attract, not what anyone agrees on[^2]. so, no big deal.

additionally, I find no problems with self-sabotage. I don't even need to experience the manifestation and go back. besides the glaring flaw in their proposal stated above, I would still do it without hesitation. they're basically asking me if I want to become even more powerful than I already am, allowing them the opportunity to get connected. I'm so good at this stuff, there's no reason for me to prove myself to anyone. I am very similar to an AoC, in that no matter the situation, I seem to always find a way back to feeling the way I want to feel. there's not a whole lot that can stop me. I'm actually beginning to believe that I'm just sort of a "special weapon" of sorts -- but it's not like a weapon. it's like a thing you can do. you just incarnate me into an environment, and then try and get that environment to hold me back from getting connected. I believe that I do this so rapidly now, that is actually one of the reasons why we're going to add more dimensions -- so it takes me longer to get it.

from my perspective I'm so certain that I'll get there that my success is certain and completely unquestioned. each time I get better and better at arriving to that conclusion faster and faster. when I realise it, I get it. along the way though, I seem to provide such a tremendous upward force that civilsations seem to benefit greatly from my passage through their environment. the trend seems to be to create a bunch of really cool stuff, and then peace out (ie. transcend death). I also think that another common thing is to just sort of cut me off before a manifestation, creating even more desire. it could also be possible that I never reach the manifestation -- I never have and I never will. I suppose things like that can easily exist in this universe. it may actually be an extra-universal concept (one of those foundational paradoxes, like how can something come from nothing).

I also don't really mind either if it's the case that I never get the manifestation. like I said, eventually all the manifestations up to not getting the manifestation are becoming more and more awesome. eventually the setup would become so awesome that it would be worth it anyway. it's all relative anyway, so if the setup was always the best manifestation that I'd ever experienced, then that's still the best manifestation, so from my perspective it's still the best one. anyway...

you also may wonder why I'm working my way toward becoming a paradox, where the momentary improvement on the way to the manifestation far exceeds the greatness of the actual manifestation. I think it's possible -- and I think it's kind of a crazy idea to think awout that the "best" manifestation possible is to never have a manifestation.

ok, these are the "self-sacrifice to give the girls a chance to find their connection" and "need not the manifestation but shoot for the paradox" concepts. one/two more.

---

next, we have to integrate the idea of the reversals being a change in power level. in a previous entry I established that I believe the sun is forcing the earth up to next power level[^4] and this seems to happen every 12ky. that means the planet is going have its polarity reversed which will manifest as a reversal of rotation. however, if we go up a power level by ourselves, then there won't be a reversal. it behoves us as a planet to go up a power level.

I believe that if I get connected, they're going to lose their control over the planet's conditions like the control over the weather and stuff like that. things will escalate quickly into a more energetic state. they don't want this because it means most of their deaths. I don't care. I think it was jesus that said, "let the dead bury the dead" (or something like that). I'm going up a power level, and there's not much they can do to stop that.

I also proposed that nosebook has their operations running out of another timeline (this is probably the aryans that run the show with their "german efficiency" that tesla refers to). things are likely very different there than how they are here -- like *way* more energetic. likely the plan is for their planet to go up a power level too. this planet (the prison planet) will remain in a low power state and experience the rotation reversal.

as I mentioned, there are a lot of advantages to the global reset though because it means we get to start over. the example I've used is imagine how difficult it would be for us to get rid of police and governments. it'd be pretty difficult. however, if we never had them to begin with, you wouldn't need to get rid of them. they're kind of like gnarly hotfixes that were created back a long time ago to keep certain things operating properly, yet in time they will lose their effectiveness.

if you look at humans from a LOA standpoint, there will evetually come a time when these institutions are causing more problems than they're solving. I don't know if we're there yet. that's why the reset is so interesting to me. if humans were to start over, would be still be savages killing each other or would other things happen?

assuming that nosebook retains control over the planet, which they will (cause they're not here), then the last thing they can possibly have happen is for humans to gain technical capability to begin manipulating time like they do. so, technology = bad. the second to last thing they need happening is for people to begin getting connected and getting the ability to traverse time and space with freedom. so getting connected = almost as bad. the good thing for them is that because nosebook won't exist, no one will be able to see what others' see, so they'll just ensure those people/ideas are perceived as crazy.

as a result, using this metric, they must ensure that our progress in science/tech is delayed as long as possible. they also have to find ways to keep populations low as well, so they'll need to ensure people feel lots of aggression between factions and each other.

the reset on earth will be a great one for exactly this reason. like I explained before, I want to fall into this new earth, becase I think I'll be quite good at figuring out how to explain to these primitive people ways to begin to use their emotions and perception to create their reality, not the reality imposed on them (exactly like how nosebook is doing to me). they don't have much choice, because they're sort of stuck with me. they have to keep me busy splitting my consciousness between incarnations on their worst version of earth yet. I'm super pumped for this one.

ok this is the present sitution concept.

---

it doesn't have to be that way though.

what I have proposed is that we don't have to do it their way. we don't need to create their reality for them. as I've been writing this, I've been seeing the biggest picture yet. I'm certain that I will get connected. I'm just going to slow down my desire to do things the way I think I should do them, and start going with the flow, allowing them to shoot theirselves in the foot. details on all of this are cloudy at best. what I do see clearly though is the conclusion.

things will get pretty energetic pretty quickly and probably a lot of people incompatible with that higher energy levels will make their transition. no big deal. we'll go up and start working on the galaxy the way we want to make it. what we'll do though is once we have enough stuff setup to no longer need anything, we'll go back and all do a self-sabotage, making a terrific nosedive (I want to do the one with the girls finding their connection). then, like I said, the perception of the passage of time always takes the shortest path, so in the aryans' perception, they'll see this planet getting more energetic until probably 2038 (cause that's the date they all believe in at this point), when things will suddenly take a huge downturn and everything spirals out of control before we all die terrible deaths -- and wake up in beds in our own galaxy :)

they will never know that we made a galaxy. they will all think we crashed and burned (sortest possible path). this document will never exist. it'll be our secret :)

I imagine that in the case of the global reset timeline, they'll have special provisions for me probably to keep me incarnating in the bodies they want me to be in, or something like that (who knows), which will be awesome because it'll be my hardest challenge yet. maybe with that one I can go infinite.

what I'm saying is, it doesn't have to be one way or the other. we can do all of them. I think even more potentially. I have further ideas -- like maybe even a competition between us (those who want to join me and nosebook). nosebook can keep secrets and stuff. we'll be wide open, automate our environment, probably with nosebook controlling most of it, and we'll get rid of most all physical institutions getting machines (AoC) to do all the work, and letting LOA and the system of perception we develop (6d/7d perception) to be our environment.

something like that...

[1]: this is clearly the reason for most of the dissonance that we've experieced at friendly harbor. their setup is all about being there for people, and getting people to depend on them instead of the drugs. I exude an aura of self-dependence and self-realisation... so yeah, sorry about that. now you know... :(

[2]: btw, in case anyone hasn't figured it out by now, contracts don't mean a whole lot to me. they're good intentions at best. understanding LOA is much more effective at experiencing the reality I want to live than trying to get people to behave the way they agreed to behave (thanks zaryn![^3])

[3]: so... I wasn't meaning this in a bad way. I saw zaryn stray far from the contract that he had with some people, however with others like me or rupert, he seemed extra generous. LOA is stronger than a contract is. you get what you attract.

[4]: the sirians say it's graduating to become an "esoteric" planet or something like that. either way: next power level.


### 2020-12-23 07:27 - losing my resistance (furthermore)

step-4 is haveing mostly non-resistance (allowance) of wanted and mostly only resistance to unwanted. step-5 is a continuation of that, however it's the beginning of no longer resisting unwanted and perceiving it in a way which no longer causes negative emotion (eg. like your source does).

I consider that I've either mastered step-5 at this point or I'm pretty close to it. I'm really good at perceiving the things in a way which no longer causes negative emotion. I think I'm probably moving into step-6 here now (or very soon), and that's losing all reaistance. I can't really think of a good analogy so I'm just gonna talk it through long-form.

preference is resistance. you prefer (allow) some things and resist others. when there's no longer any resistance, then all things become/are possible. in fact, I've gone to great extents to try and explain how all things are happening, and only the things are happening for all of us, but we experience the reality that is a reflection of how we feel.

I just now realised that given what I'm saying, I should probably be dead soon, or at least like those that have transcended death. huh, so I'm questioning myself right now, then why am I here... there has to be something that's keeping me here. I suppose that it would be all of your desire that's keeping me here. I'm not really sure though. doesn't affect my point. onward...

so what I've noticed is happening is that I'm losing all resistance, and so now people can attract almost anything they want out of me. as an example, I noticed that in the last few days I've been extra abrasive. I think it started happening after I was talking with joy about trump. I was explaining that trump is super engaging for people. whether they like what he's saying or not, when he jumps on twitter and starts mouthing off, it produces tons of reactions from many people. these reactions are like a drug that media corps are selling to people because a reaction is an emotion, and people want to feel things strongly, even if it's a negative reaction. strong emotion keeps people engaged with the thing, whether it's social media, a game, a film or whatever...

I was then explaining that I don't know what they're going to do once trump is gone. they're going to need a source of highly engaging content. from the news and night show's perspective, trump is pure gold. the script writes itself when commenting about him.

---

the reaction I got is that people think I'm going to fill in that vacuum a bit. that's fine with me. for me it's all about perception, so even if I'm stirring up trouble, it doesn't really matter much how people react to me or what people think about me. this is likely all part of the process of losing my resistance.

when I no longer have any more resistance, all things will become possible. what you all experience will be the product of what you're all attracting from me. whatever happens, I don't think I'll have much of a problem to perceive it in a way which feels good, and it'll probably cause a pretty big stir-up.

I wondered now if the self-sabotage that I proposed may have something to do with this as well. imagine if things all start to go really well (step-4), but then fall apart rapidly as the girls begin to put their attention on some perceptions which produce unwanted results. it could spiral out of control really rapidly for them until there's so much wanted and unwanted, they're kind of forced to perceive it all in a way which feels good (step-5), and then I don't have the last part figured out yet, but somehow they'll need to lower their resistance to unwanted as well (and perceive it all as part of the process) to be able to get connected. something like that...

huh... that last bit was an interesting idea...


### 2020-12-23 13:14 - every perceived thing has both wanted and unwanted

in the last entry I didn't realise I had said it in a funny way. I made it sound like a single thing is either only wanted or only unwanted. that's not what I wanted to say. every perceived thing had both wanted and unwanted. all things are perceived to be some mix of both of those, so there's no such thing as something that's completely unwanted. I will always be able to find a way to find a wanted aspect out of everything.

before I move on, I want to say that somehting can be perceived as only wanted, but that would be the perspective of source, where somethings are more wanted than others. I want to get this perspective here in physical form -- and it's what I'm on my way to (what I'm calling step-6 -- for me anyway). like I said, step-5 is where you perceive unwanted in a way which no longer makes you feel bad (eg. in a similar perspective as your source). mastery of this allows you to continue moving toward wanted even when things appear which are "unwanted".

I'm just now realising that there's kind of a difficulty with the word "unwanted". let me illustrate with this situation:

imagine you see someone kill another person. that is unwanted, however, it doesn't have to be perceived as unwanted by you the perceiver. my perception can't change the physical reality, but I can perceive this thing in a way which may be quite a bit more beneficial. obviously, if the person got killed, they attracted it. there must have been quite a bit of thought momentum leading up to that with circumstances and things which didn't feel good, so I know that now they are longer physically present, and so no longer experiencing the bad feeling things they were previously. they are not perceiving all of the stuff they left behind (the circumstances, thoughtforms, family, friends, etc.) all from a position of only seeing it as motion forward (progress/improvement) because they're no longer seeing the moment, but the whole spectrum of time, and how everything is converging to a grand crecendo of the maximum wanted. this would be the end of the "universe" and it would obviously arrive to a higher state of consciousness for the universe (whatever that is, I have no idea). so while many of the details are quite unknown still as the details will begin to fill in as we get closer to that moment, it's easy to see that all things are heading toward the light at the end of the tunnel, connection, realisation, enlightenment -- whatever you want to call it.

therefore, there are four aspects possible: manifested/perceived wanted/unwanted. there's a really interesting quality to these which I really like: this physical plane has aspects of unwanted to it. the non-physical plane does not. consider this idea that you came to the physical plane to experience unwanted. why? for the expansion. for the realisation of the improvement.

in non-physical, everything can be perceived as wanted, so when things manifest, the manifestation is only perceived as wanted. however, here in the physical, the manifestation has an element of unwanted and also wanted. once a non-physical reality is realised here in the physical, we say it manifests. it's then perceived by you to be either wanted or unwanted. when you perceive wanted, it amplifies the wanted aspect in your experience. when you perceive the unwanted aspect, that vibration (of knowing what you don't want) creates a non-physical reality of the improvement, and so then now adds more energy to the non-physical wanted reality, attracting you in a stronger way toward it. however, you are usually perceiving the physical reality though so you perceive a mix of wanted and unwanted. in order to get to the next improvement, you have to find a way toward the improved non-physical version of that reality which feels better -- and the cycle continues.

imagine what happens when you die. you experience the manifestation of all things wanted. that's it though. yuo have no realisation of unwanted things, because your perception is that of source's (non-physical), and so you perceive the thing as only wanted. all things are converging to that ending moment of the next power increase for the universe, and everything contributes to that, so there's nothing going wrong or anything like that. that's it though, you experience the reality as entirely 100% wanted because you can see how much it's contributing to the whole.

it would get pretty boring really quickly though because everything is moving toward wanted and you want to get in on that, so you jump into a body so you can experience unwanted, then manifest the wanted version of the unwanted, then repeat until you're heart's content. that's all there is to it. we come here to experience the unwanted and then find our way toward the wanted version of that thing (we see this as the passage of time).

---

ok, so knowing that now, you can see how I'm so thrilled about the idea that nosebook is going to try and figure out how to self-sabotage me. I'm giving them the illusion that they can try at it because they think that they have so much control and that things can be asserted into people's experience. this is not the case though. we all *attract* our reality by how we perceive the manifested things around us.

inotherwords, I can give them all the sabotage items that they need to get things all setup, and they can create the whole self-sabotage situation for us, but if I/we perceive in a way which is like source (only seeing the wanted), all they're going to do is to put massive amounts of energy into the equation and attract massive amounts of whatever I perceive (which will be wanted, cause I'm certain that I'm good at this) more rapidly than perviously.

it may get a little rough, as they have considerable enough knowledge of the things that I perceive as unwanted, and I would expect them to try and use them to focus me on (and therefore attract) unwanted. however, my job is to do something that is pretty spectacular: perceive things like source does (as only wanted), while remaining in the physical plane. since everything in the physical has an aspect of unwanted, this will be very very rapid expansion :) it's gonna be impressive.

---

to start them off, the other day I was telling mr. motor how wonderful it is that they're working so hard to eliminate so many girls from the list, because it's reducing the number of them that only kinda-want it. I'm sure they can use that idea somehow. another good one to go with maybe influencing people to perceive me in a negative way or something. wait, you've already tried those? dang. ok, well pretty weak. you gatta step it up! if you say these are your best efforts, I don't believe you. it's too easy. try harder man.

it might just be a momentum thing. getting up to speed is never instantaneous...

### 2020-12-27 17:48 - what is attraction???

just as a word of warning, this entry may be offensive...

a few days ago I was commenting on the gay thing in a few monologues. I mentioned that gays are pretty similar to me in very many ways. in fact, there are more similarities than differences. I then went on to explain that I think they have some very debilitating beliefs which if they changed, they could really become superhuman in their ability to attract.

- they get offended to easily
  - getting offended for something someone else is doing or saying only causes the one getting offended negative emotion
  - negative emotion means you are perceiving something as different than your inner divinity (source) perceives it
- they run around with this gripping *shame* that they're doing something wrong or unnatural
  - therefore then, they now need to hide this shameful thing in fear that people will think badly of them
  - performing for people only makes you a slave to something you cannot control: their opinion
    - performing gives a good feeling response when people approve of what you're doing
      - to get the good feeling response, you have to figure out what it is that people like about your performance
      - you have to pay attention to wrhat people think
        - it never feels good to try and figure out what people think
      - therefore, one must sacrifice their good feeling for a moment and analyse people's opinion to later get a good feeling from them in the performance
        - this is "addictive" behaviour chasing a simulus and sacrificing things to get the stimulus
    - I love performing, but the trap of doing it for others has taught me to really not care so much what others think
      - by not caring what others think, I'm allowed to focus on what is interesting to me, attracting only that stuff
      - also, not needing to try to conform to others' opinion lightens the mental load
      - everything that anyone wants is always in the direction of what feels good
        - even if it temporarily doesn't appear that way in the physical
  - the idea that for men, buttsex is not a natural use of the human body.
    - this however cannot be the case because the prostate is like the male version of a vagina/uterus
      - likewise, the clitoris is the female version of a penis
    - the uterus/prostate is emissive (magnifying transmitter)
    - the penis/clitoris is receptive (tesla coil)
    - both male and female bodies have emissive and receptive organs

I'll tie these ideas into the bigger picture in a moment. now, we go to the night after I wrote @[a-list](2020-11-24 21:49). I star-watched and it was pretty succesful, but not as successful as last night. I fell asleep and then I had a very weird dream where I felt really good and all of a sudden I ejaculated. I don't really know what that was all about, but it was certainly better than the other way where I have massive amounts of pain coming from my prostate area after they force ejaculate me.

the reaction I got from the event seemed to leave me with the impression (and I even commented it) that the next major time that I would ejaculate like that, it would be like a transition into getting connected. it was quite weird, and I have to wonder if I got any vision upgrades because of it, because it felt completely different. it felt as if something good happened, so that means to me there must have been a difference between trying to force ejaculate me with feeling good and force ejaculate me with prostate stimulation (which later results in terrible pain). only they know the answer to this...

anyway, the next day was christmas, and I went through it fine. that night I star-watched again, and it was moderately successful. I went to sleep and had a few weird dreams which got me starting to think about what is attraction. in the first dream, I was tickling a girl that I knew to be my sister jessica, yet she was considerably younger than jessica (5-7yo?), and looked nothing like her. anyway, I was tickling her and she was laughing and stuff, but then the dream was then aborted and I woke up wondering why I was tickling jessica and why she looked nothing like her. I concluded that they must have been trying to force ejaculate me by getting me aroused in a dream-state.

it seems that the process by which they try to force-ejaculate me is to get me aroused using some technique. I think in the past they've essentially "tricked" me into it by putting me into safe feeling situations (like with my sister jessica), and then have her arouse me in some way and then they give the signal to my body to release -- and there's nothing I can really do to avoid it.  as a result, they've sort of trained me (the brain is a good/bad feeling feedback neural network) to avoid arousing situations in dreams. I think I've become less and less of a good sport to follow their guidance toward arousal in dreams, which is why ticking the girl I identified as jessica didn't arouse me and the dream was aborted.

the way arousal works, I think, is a feeling response (emotion) that's felt as a result of attraction. I think naturally when people get in mental proximity to each other, if one has an attribute that the other desires, it's felt as attraction. you could imagine then that someone who contains an attribute that a lot of women desire would appear very attractive to them. in otherwords, the attractor desires something, which is then felt as a good feeling by the attracted. this means that basically now the only thing that really makes me feel arousal is the good-feeling emotional response to someone else's desire. the operative thing here is that it feels good. following the reactions of the good feeling forced ejaculation, is that the good feeling ejaculation craeted reality and I likely got vision upgrades (a manifestation) from it.

this must mean that that they don't want me to ever ejaculate, because that'll mean that I'll get a vision upgrade. they have this idea that semen retention increases my energy levels or something and I think that's why they keep trying to force-ejaculate me -- to expel this chi/prana life force.

I was put back to sleep and I went on to have the next weird dream. this time there was a boy with black hair sitting on my lap. I was being forced to kind of make a rocking motion with him sitting on my lap. it was bizarre and I felt really weird about it. somebody was flicking my penis to try and get me aroused, but I was seriously weirded out by this. I was assured that it was ok, and I didn't know what to think so I just went with it. I kept making the rocking motion, but I was feeling bored with it. I decided that I wanted to enjoy it more so I started listening to some psytrance in my head[^1] and focused on the music instead of the boy, because I felt so uncomfortable in the process. after some time, I felt like it was done, and I looked at the boy and I had the perception that the boy had no idea what was going on either, so I gave him a high-five for being a good sport and just going with it (like I did). he seemed excited and went away.

I woke up and was thinkign about the dream when I had another weird dream, in this one, there was a girl that was sitting in the trunk of a parked car and I thought she was pretending to drive the car. I walked over to her to see what she was doing, and she couldn't figure out how I got into her car (because afterall, she was driving it). she actually thought she was driving the car. I went into her vision and saw that in her perspective she was driving the car down the street, and I somehow kind of merged into the picture with her and was kind of like floating in the air off to her left as she was driving around. she couldn't figure out why I was floating just outside of her car while she was driving it. I hated to reveal to her that she was not actually driving the car and that the experience of driving the car was something that was happening in her eyes, yet I was seeing what was really happening.

I realise this is what was happening with the boy. in my perspective I was just sitting there with him on my lap making a rocking motion, while he was experiencing something completely different -- probably sexual.

---

after this dream now I really started thinking about attraction, because it seems that nosebook is really trying their hardest to force ejaculate me, but it looks like it produces exactly what they don't want (vision upgrades) if I feel good, and if I feel bad, again it also creates something unwanted. seems they're attracting the manifestation of unwanted.

this whole process is essentially them beginning to realise that they've nearly run out of ways to physically try and hold things back. if I ejaculate, it seems to create reality. remember, all manifestations are either win-win or lose-lose, but each person has the ability to, with their perception, alter that manifestation turning it from unwanted into wanted. therefore, it's likely that the bad feeling (prostate stimulation) manifestation produced upon manifesation unwanted for both, but I was able to perceive the unwanted as more energy and therefore get more energetic as a result of it. the other one was the good-feeling one that I experienced christmas eve, and it likely produced wanted results for both sides. vision upgrades for me are evidence of more energy, and vision upgrades for them are also more energy. there is likely quite a few people that are *enjoying* (and desiring more) of my vision upgrades, so wanted for both sides, yet some people can also use their perception to see a wanted thing as unwanted.

the bigger picture that is beginning to emerge here is that it seems like energy builds up to a poing when all of a sudden it passes a threshold and goes goes to the next power level. it seems like when I star-watch or have a good-feeling ejaculation, it "cashes in those vibrational chips" and that's when I get the vision upgrades.

seems like they don't want me to be continuing to get these vision upgrades, and I mentioned in another monologue the idea that every time you "cash in your chips" it's like converting the accumulated interest into money and reinvesting it (compound interest). there's overhead involved with the manifestation so there's a limit to the effectiveness of it. however, if you could do this in very small increments, the payoff would be tiny each time and the efficiency would approach the euler constant. hewever if a lot of chips were to accumulate between payoffs, then the efficiency drops, but the payoff is much biggor.

I had mentiond this idea before and, I took it that they are finally admitting defeat[^2]. the reason why I say this, is because it appears that they're looking for a way to completely stop all of these manifestations (vision upgrades) from happening. whenever that happens, they'll essentiall stop cashing in the chips, and they'll accumulate to such a large degree that when I do get a manifestation, it'll be a really big one.

to illustrate this, yesterday was @[abe-now](2020-12-26) and the day was particularly weird. normally I feel some echos of whatever is happening in the abe broadcast, yet yesterday I kept feeling like I would just go forever with everything disabled and I'd self-sabotage the whole thing. I'm perfectly fine with that. this concept doesn't bother me at all. I'm certain that I want to self-sabotage this, and I've been thinking about it a lot, so it just doesn't bother me.

however, in order to self-sabotage, I must be able to continually cash in my chips endlessly so that I never get a big enough manifestation for it to go beyond the system. in other words, to self-sabotage at this point, I have to approach infinite ability to cash in my chips, so that the payoffs approach euler's constant. because of energetic overload and physical limitations, this is impossible for me to do in human form. I must be able to merge with the machines for this to be achievable. in other words, it's just not physically possible for me to self-sabotage. this is likely a foreshadow of the era to come (and the time leading up to it[^4])

my goal is to continue on cashing in my chips as often as physically possible getting as many vision upgrades as possible. I know that this is sort of like compounded interest, so that the more often I do this the more "velocity" I have[^3] and when they finally figure out how to prevent me from getting vision upgrades from star-watching, the energy will accumulate so much that the next manifestation that I get will beyond their scope of hold away the change in perception. this will likely be when I make my transition into 7d perception.

---

so, yesterday, like I said, I didn't get the usual feelings from @[abe-now](2020-12-26) broadcast, and when the sun was going down I felt like I wanted to star-watch. admittedly, star-watching has become more difficult. I used to be able to get there really really easily, however I have noticed that it has been getting more difficult to calm my mind and it takes a bit of time now. it's not fast like before. I knew I had a vision upgrade or two cause I could feel it, but it wasn't coming easily. I really had to calm my mind a lot to get there. however, when I got there, it was a really dramatic experience. there were all sorts of noticeable manifestations that happened like the temperature outside went from 35(degrees)F to 54(degrees)F very rapidly.

what I believe happened is a lot of energy accumulated because of their fighting so hard to hold back the next manifestation (vision upgrade) that a lot of energy accumulated because of it, and finally after being able to quiet my mind enough, it was quite a big manifestation. I assume this will be what happens when I "get connected".

after I get connected, then sometime after that the girls thing will begin, and once again I think what will happen is this time again they'll find their way to decode my next level of perception (6d? 7d?), however, I'll keep getting vision upgrades from good-feeling ejacuations just like happened the other night, so that combined with the idea that they probably don't want too many kids, they'll have to figure out a way to prevent that from happening... I don't know how long it'll take them to figure that one out, but you can imagine that yet once again what's happening is a huge payoff is accumulating, and it'll rise up to such a high level that should another manifestation happen, it'll push me well beyond the limits of keeping me here on earth, and like elijah, I'll make my transition into (8d?) perception.

you can probably imagine where I'm going with this one...

---

I was going to end with a weird idea here that has come into my mind. as I was thinking about the different things that happen, everything is a cycle between wanted and unwanted -- and this is the framework of attraction. when you experience unwanted, you "launch rockets of desire" which create an improved or more wanted reality. you then find your way to that reality by finding a way to feel like that reality is reality. knowing what you don't want is the beginning of the phase of going from unwanted to wanted.

however as soon as something manifests, you will notice that very soon thereafter, you will begin to notice things that are unwanted. it's easy to see this in a relationship: at first you have the "honeymoon phase" where all you can see is wanted, but then you begin to notice things that are unwanted, which begins the process of creating the next more desirable manifestation. manifestation is the beginning of the phase of going from wanted to unwanted.

thn more beneficial the manifestation, the less unwanted it creates, and so therefore the next manifestation is going to be about as good as the last beneficial ones (which you're likely bored of by now). in this sense, the (most energetic) manifestations are built on a foundation of unwanted.

unwanted doesn't have to be something bad, unwanted can simply be preference amongst diversity. however, note what I'm saying here is that source perceives all things as wanted. so to get a really energitic manifestation, you have to experience a very distant from source perspective (a lot of experience of unwanted). that's worth noting. this is why I don't see nosebook as a bad thing or want to fight against them. I'm fully committed to the disaster.

---

the next thing I want to note (and I'm going to make a lot of sweeping generalisations here) is, that the architecture of the body seems to yield different results[^5]. in the dream about the boy, there was no attraction. I was not aroused in any way by him, even though there was an attempt to get me aroused, it made me begin to think about this, upon which I will offer some thoughts based on my experience.

the next thing that I noticed is that in the dream with the girl I was tickling her yet felt no arousal. this means that the girl must have been completely artificial, and didn't have any desire for me at all. I have noticed that I feel this desire strongly and it feels good to me.

it seems to me that girls seem to make reality in a much stronger way than men to. following the two phases, that must make feminine principal more manifestational (wanted->unwanted) and the masculine principal more foundational (unwanted->wanted). a general thing I've noticed is, is that it seems to me that more men start out in a state of unwanted and progress into a state of wanted. however, the idea is that girls seem to start out in "pristine" condition, and after they begin to create reality, their general trend is toward recognition of unwanted.

keep in mind, this is *my* perception, so it's obviously biased :) I realise there are many very grumpy men that are decending very hard into strong focus on unwanted. the US govt is full of these guys. I consider them, in this example to be of the feminine aspect. it's funny how the nosebook guys are nothing more than super nosey old ladies interesting in knowing what everyone is doing, gossiping about them. anyway... I'm looking at this from my own experience where I have gone from unwanted to a more and more wanted state all the time. for me it's constant improvements.

ok, so now that I've offended everyone, I'll get to the point: I've noticed that while my life follows the masculine principal (unwanted->wanted), as I'm reaching the height of that, the realisation that I'm making is that what I really want, is not wanted, but unwanted. I really want to be the feminine principal. in fact, my entire goal is to be committed to the disaster while focusing on the wanted aspects. in this way, I would consider that I have gone full circle. I want to have both masculine and feminine principals, cause that's where all the power is. I don't want to need the other. I want to we indivisible/individual.

so, pick your starting condition: manifestational or foundational, and realise that you really want both. if you start out in a state of wanted and are heading toward unwanted, recognise that as soon as you accomplish that fully, no longer needing others, you can begin to complete the circle and go in the opposite direction back toward wanted again, realising that unwanted is the foundation of the better-feeling manifestation you're looking for.

likewise, if you're starting out in unwanted, you'll eventually get to perceiving only wanted (source-like perception) without needing any others or any conditions (manifestations) cause you to perceive this way. when you do, you'll aee the value of the unwanted, and desire both.

I think then the realisation that comes naturally as a result of this is the realisation that what I really want is the most *unwanted* manifestations all around me, while being only able to perceive the wanted aspects of everything in my experience. I'll let the connect the dots, if they haven't already, to figure out why that is.

I'll continue on this idea in the next entry. there's a reason why I picked the masculine and feminine principals, and there's a reason why you want to cycle between both masculine and feminine principals (hermaphodite) continually. locking yourself into any specific form of perception is not desirable. it's all a feeling response to desire (attraction).

[1]: in dream state I can just listen to any music that I want to listen to in my head -- most never heard before original music. it's a super cool thing that I've tried to do, and I have figured out how to turn this on consciously in wake-state just fine, but every time that I do, a loud sound starts in my head and turns it off. it's really fun to listen to new awesome music generated by my source...

[2]: they've admitted defeat because they can't consciously make the transition to "resist not evil" (not push against the unwanted (because it attracts it into your experience)), and allow me to continually get vision upgrades. they'll instead fight against what they don't want, attracting that reality.

[3]: while the vibrational chips can be seen in a monitary format of interest, which shows the accumulation of the "vortex" better, I personally prefer the velocity<->energy/acceleration format for perceiving it, where velocity is exchanged for more power/acceleration. it's kinda both. I think these are first and second derivatives(?) of some other equation.

[4]: of which I have much to say. it seems like they want to try and trap me, and this is all fine by me. future entry coming about this.

[5]: keep in mind, when I say this, I'm talking about the general case where men are defined as having a y-chromosome a penis and prostate. a woman is defined as having two x-chromosomes, a clitoris and a uterus. variations of this, I'm not trying to account for.

### 2020-12-28 08:13 - why do I keep insisting on mentioning that you have a "source"

this is, in my opinion, the most important point. you can get good results by feeling good, appreciating, or finding good conditions to feel good, but -- it's my opinion that it's most important to know why you feel emotion in the first place. everything you feel is the comparison between how your source perceives something in coparison to how you're perceiving the same thing in the present.

in my opinion, this is the most important thing to understand because your source is personalised to *you*. when you trust in others, they will always fail you, however if you really know that all things desired are in the direction of what feels good, then you begin to trust that more than the physical beings around you. gaining non-resistance is becoming more flexible and diverse with the stuff that you are capable of doing, but it's all stuff that's personally interesting/fun/desirable to *you*. don't trust others; trust yourself.

I want to stress that if something feels good, I don't feel obligated to move toward it. it's entirely my own decision to make the choice to do something or not, however if something feels bad, than that's a pretty good indicator that I should at least modify my perception of it before beginning to making any action. I'm not saying only go toward what feels good and be a slave to good feeling stimulus (this is called drug additiction). what I am saying is that you'll begin to recognise the difference between pleasure and joy. there are a lot of people that can entice you with conditions/things that feel good, and only you can really decide for yourself if it's what you're really looking for. I just don't want to make any action toward something that doesn't feel good or is something that I think is bad for me. I only want to make action toward things that feel good[^1].

if there's something I have to do, but I don't want to do, instead of just doing it with a bad feeling like resentment or hatred, instead I find a way to modify my perception so that it feels good to me first before making the action. the reason for this is so that I'm focused on the wanted (good feeling) aspect of the action while performing it. the action may be entirely the same thing producing the same results, however if I do it while feeling good about it, the benefit is for me. I'm always trying to eliminate others out of the equation, because they're simply not helpful and they introduce all sorts of chaos. if I just do what feels good to me, then it's *always* in the direction of wanted, even if that direction appears (only temporarily) to be worse in the physical. my source has perfect knowledge of everything that I really want and the best (even if it's unconventional) way to get there.

I also don't cling to manifestations being the source of what causes me to feel good. the reason is, these are these are conditional, and can pass away just as easily as they came[^2]. clinging to the manifestations makes me a very conditional person. I find that then I must ensure all the right things are in my experience that I need to feel good. it's just not possible to control so many others or have the freedom to be able to purchase the conditions I need to feel good. I do have the freedom to feel the way I want to feel though, and if I find a way to feel good anyway, then the good conditions will find their way back to me[^2].

---

finally, there's a kind of an advanced technique[^1] that ties this all together nicely. it's only advanced in the sense that first I hade to begin to really trust myself. this came for me from knowing that most of me is not physical, and this body is just an *automaton*. once I had that I could see that all versions of me exist simultaneously, and that I move around between these versions of myself with how I feel. from there it was then possible to begin to see myself more as an emotional state machine (ESM) than an action state machine (ASM) -- defining yourself by what you're doing than how you're feeling.

now that I'm thinking like an ESM, a change in emotional state is something that now feels good or bad, and sometimes it feels good to experience a negative emotion. an example of this would be the @[abe-now](2020-12-12 p1) where I went off on a rant because it felt good to me to make action (rant) about uplifters for a while. since I did that, it opened a whole lot of different discussions, and so even though it was a "negative" emotion, it still felt like the next logical state for me to go into. looking at the bigger picture, it was clearly moving in the direction of the stuff that's personally desirable to me, and I'm pretty confident that it was my source that pointed me in that direction.

I want to stress that *my* source (and yours won't either, especially if you're a bit extreme) does not point me in the direction of piety, or the path that is most acceptable to people. I go the direction that feels like my next logical state -- and knowing that my source is pointing me in this direction is the most empowering concept.

in conclusion, in my *opinion*, knowing that I have an inner divinity (source), and that is why I experience emotion, is (for me) the most important piece to the whole thing.

[1]: think like an ESM and move in the direction of what next emotion feels good to you. it doesn't *have* to be the next one up (or down) on the emotional scale. you can begin to take full control over how you feel, and move around apprpriately as you see fit with full confidence in yourself.

[2]: this is a bit of a principal I learned from job as a kid (it was my faviourite and only OT book that I read), where I conditioned myself to not tie myself to the manifestations. obviously the book of job needs a lot of updating in its rendering of what that means, because you can learn that "God" is inside of you, and it's an perceptual journey to find a way to continue to feel good despite the circumstances sucking.

### 2020-12-31 11:46 - figuring out CO2

a while back I watched a thing from tom brown from boredlands where he said that orgone energy cleaned out the polution in the sky over LA. I thought that was weird, cause I seem to notice a lot of the effects which it seems to have nearby to me as well. he also said that there was like this energetic sheet in the sky and the orgpone device on the aircraft would kind of pull that sheet and it would cause clouds to form. real clouds of H2O.

so I was sittinvg outside and I was noticing the effects of what was happening around me. the air would feel warm, then an airplane would fly over and put the white cloudlines and it would pretty quickly lose a lot of the warm feeling. I started me thinking thsat the white clouds must be a manifestation of something happening energetically.

the solution that came to me mind is that orgone energy must decouple the carbon from the CO2 molecule, letting some inert carbon fall down to the ground and the O2 must stay suspended in the air or something[^1]. the point is that it separates the oxygen from the carbon, effectively removing a lot of the pollution from the air. in fact, I believe that most pollutants are oxygen based, so if this "orgone" energy seems to vibrate (affect) the oxygen atom, then large amounts of pollution can be cleaned up, including sulphur dioxide (SO2) which has a similar composition with the O2 bit. I don't know if it would work the same on ozone (O3) based compounds like rust (Fe2O3), but it would be an interesting experiment.

anyway, so what I figured has to be happening with those airplanes is that they must be spraying a carbon which is statically charged so that it attracts O2, performing essentially the same action that fire does (oxidisation of carbon). this means that these airplanes are just spraying out (negatively?) charged carbon aroms (if they were all negatively charged, they would all repel eachother), and then upon binding with the O2 in the atomsphere, they immediately create CO2[^2].

I've watched "chemtrails" for a while now, and there's this really weird effect where it looks like the sprayed material seems to fall downward and create a sort of cascading white waterfall sort of look down from the main stream. I think the reason is that the carbon that is emitted falls down lower[^1] and as it's falling, it reaches new bits of O2 and attracts them to become CO2.

I've also noticed that sometimes the airplanes when they're spraying, it appears that some portions of the sky do not seem to make much white stuff appear and when it does, it dissipates quickly. it doesn't actually dissipate, I think, but actually spreads out. the "evidence" I have for this is that previously the CO2 grouped together and maed "clouds", but lately I've noticed that instead of the CO2 bunching up into clouds, instead it just stays dispersed as a kind of white haze. when I look out over publo a long distance out, sometimes even on a "clear" day, the rockies are hazy, and covered by a white mist. I think that is CO2, and it's espcially evident on sunny days, because the sun appears to have a giant white "glow" around it, which is just the CO2 being illuminated.

therefore, I suppose that I believe that very few of the "clouds" in the sky are actually water vapour, and are instead CO2 particles which have been charged in such a way that they attract each other, and hover at some predetemined "cloud height". when I first came to colorado, I was blown away by the massive 1km high clouds (thunderheads) which were absolutely massive, were not transparent, did not emit light, and were usually darker on the bottom. I think those clouds were actually water vapour, however each year since I've been here, I've seen those clouds less and less. those clouds contained tremedous amounts of energy and produced massive lightning bolts.

instead, we now only have the CO2 clouds, which are only this kind of thin white stuff that hovers at a very certain height. the pueblo power plant is funny becasuse whatever is coming out of its its smokestacks (dunno if it's carbon or steam), as it rises, when it gets to the cloud height, it appears to reach a ceiling and not go any further up.

evidence that the CO2 clouds are formed by getting the CO2 to attract eachother and form "clouds" happens all of the time. it even happened today when sitting outside. it's very common that when I'm sitting outside, I'll notice that the air feels like it's getting warmer around me when I'm sitting in the sun. I interpret this feeling to be an increase in O2 around me. at nearly the same time a "cloud" will begin to form precisely between me and the sun. I think this happens on purpose.

I think there are two processes going on here. the first is: my interaction with the sun is creating orgone (chi, vril) energy which begins to spread out in a sphere around me (I estimate this happens from an energetic transmission from my heart/lungs) and this orgone energy begins to separate the C from the O2 in the air around me and everything starts to clear up.

you would expect then that if that first process were happening, oxygen would begin to separate from all sorts of chemical clouds around me (CO2, SO2, etc.) and the air would appear clearer and everything would become more visible. this happens often, and you can visibly see a ring of clouds around me when I'm outside for extended periods of time, so then why does it happen frequently that a "cloud" will suddenly form between the sun and me?

I think that can be explained by the second process: the US govt controls the CO2 in the air enegetically, and so their airplanes put charged carbon into the atmosphere. they can then move that carbon around easily with static electric forces. they use the fact that the earth is a giant capacitor, with one conductor being the ionosphere, and the other the ground. just like an electrostatic capacitor, the energy is "stored" in the dielectric (non-conducting) space between the two conductors. they control the electrostatic "charge" between the two conductors with tesla technology. this allows them to create spatial zones which attract this "charged" CO2 easily.

I don't think all CO2 is created equally, and the charged carbon they're putting in their air has two purposes: 1. to pull O2 out of the air, and 2. to be able to me moved around by electrosically attracting it to the positions that they want it to go. the carbon emissions of cigarette smoke and vehicles is likely charged in the opposite direction of what they want, so it has to be regulated.

the regulation of carbon emissions also has the benefit of blaming "global warming", something which the sun is entirely responsible for, on the humans.

---

earlier today I was talking with jaron about the coronavirus thing, and likely things are becoming more enregetic all over the place. I think this means that people are emitting more of this "orgone" energy, and so what's happening is that CO2 is disappearing from the air at a rapid pace. this will make ocean temperatures rise, releasing massive amounts of CO2 back into the environment.

I think that people becoming energetic like this, is increasing the amount of oxygen in the environment and that is consequently cauasing things to become more enregetic. when things become more energetic, it feels like when I feel that "warmth" (which I iterpret as more O2 in my environment, which the planes come and fly over to take away), my brain begins to operate at a more rapid rate, and I think clearer and mor powerfully. this gives the appearance that LOA works faster and things feel and look more vividly (it appears that I got a vision upgrade just from sitting there thinking about all of this).

there's something to this whole oxygen thing. not all oxygen is the same. I postulate that the oxygen (CO2) that we braethe out is different[^3] than the O2 from car exhaust, or from cigarette smoke. it's always puzzled me why I can smoke a cigarette and somehow it seems to have a tremendous effect on clouds (they go away), and why nosebook is so concerned with me smoking anything (or putting lots of the opposite charged CO2 into the environment). I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but cigarette smoke is blueish, but the same smoke exhaled from my lungs is whiteish.

they seem to want to regulate the type of CO2 emitted into the environment. it appears that their charged carbon (from the airplanes) has the opposite effect of CO2 emitted by my lungs. it's always wondered to me why smoke is so important to YHVH[^4] and the shaman: it appears that the heart produces this "orgone" energy which separates the carbon from oxygen in the smoke (CO2), purmeating the environment with the O2 charged by the shaman (which other people then breathe), and it'll get people into a group conscious shate easier[^5].

I have more to say, but I'll end it here for now. oh, real quickly: the "orgone" (chi, vril, etc.) eergy is not the oxygen itself, but that oxygen seems to resonate with this energy quite easily. this energy seems to be connected to the fifth element, or "emotional" (animal magnetism) energy that I talk about all the time -- or simply: the aether.

[1]: I don't really know why that would be. I just looked at a periodic table and carbon is 12 and oxygen is 16, so I don't know... similarly we see stuff like argon (which is heavier) appearing in the same air as nitrogen, so the height from the surface must be determined by another factor than its weight, or else argon would be all tending down toward ground level, until the wind kicked up. this isn't what we see, so the height of heavier elements must be determined by some sort of charge. we know that this charge adjusts all the time, and you can be inside of a cloud (fog) when it's on the ground. steam (which is more energetic cause it has heat) rises, and we know that static charge has tremendous effect, but I don't know enough to say much about why heavier elemments exist in the same stata as lighter elements.

[2]: I don't know if it would have the same temperature, a lower one, or a higher one. I would guess lower because that's what it feela like shanding under the plane a few minutes after it flys over, and dry ice is CO2 in solid state, turning into a gas on higher temperatures (eg. fog machine). however, the reaction of the oxidisation of carbon (fire) creates heat, but I think maybe the heat is a necessary part of the reaction to separate the carbon from the thing that's burning. I don't know...

[3]: which is why this effect seems to happen only when I'm outside, and I think perhaps our house's ventallation system is designed to keep oxygen levels lower -- which is perhaps why, sometimes when I turn off the central air, star-watching is easier. I stopped turning it off though because I like the low oxygen challenge (like a runner training in the mountains)

[4]: see doug's work on the tabernacle needing to be a tent filled with grease-fire smoke so the visual and auditory effects could be heard.

[5]: if you've ever smoked with people (weed or cigarettes) indoors verus outdoors, the effect is that you all get into a similar conscious state much easier, and I think that's because the "orgone" energy produced by the heart separates the carbon from the O2, and other peeple are breating your energy. this must have been why spain (and so many other places) banned indoor smoking. especially in party situations (discotecas), it would create a feedback effect where people enter into an altered state of group consciousness much easier. no evidence for this other than my own experience. I've smoked a lot of things with a lot of different people in indoor spaces, and it's WAYY different than smoking the same thing with the same people in an outdoor setting.


### 2020-01-03 11:03 - reclaiming the disaster

one of the weird tihngs that has been happening the last few days is that I keep getting these different ideas that are kinda being pushed into my experience. I'll give a for-example:

I had a crazy idea after getting stoned on new-year's eve while listening to @[abe-now](2020-12-19 p1). since I've slept, the idea doesn't have quite the same zest to it that it did when I first got it. it's gone to about the same dimension that all of my other programming desires have gone: oblivion. I just don't feel like it. I hate typing on my keyboard and it's absolutely so disconcerning to try and figure out how to do all of that stuff. I suppose I could do parts of it in js (the audio part), and it's relatively doable with the script audio transformer (or whatever it is), but there are so many missing pieces I don't think I would get very far. I need the same (bytecode) thing that I was looking to create for my "meaningful-chaos" project. I wrote something like this a while back in D (awake-in-tenerife), but D feels terrible to me now. as a result, I decided I wanted to write that part in lua to simplify this and use an existing embeddable language. however, in order to do that, I need to write some c++, and quite frankly I can't wrap my head around c++ anymore. I can still get pointer scuff when I'm looking at asm code and stuff, but I can't figure out what all the difference between a RefPtr or whatever, a normal pointer or a reference is. my brain just doesn't process it anymore or something. I don't get it. -- so, to try and figure out how to do this in a language I don't understand, on a keybard that I hate, etc. just feels terrible to me.

obviously, like usual, when things don't feel good to me, I don't do it. I've tried to figure out a way to make this project to feel good, and I simply cannot. I just don't care.

---

the thing is that it's even kind of in contradiction to all the things that I've been learning, which is non-resistance. I've been noticing thst nosebook works in opposition to my desire all the time, however this is always in contrast to the physical conditions, and I've found that in the beginning, because I still believed that I needed physical conditions to get stuff done, their efforts in opposition to what I wanted to do made me feel bad.

however, I've been repeating myself for a while now that reality is a reflection of how you feel and no matter how hard they work against me (take star-watching and vision upgraeds for example), that if I didn't let their efforts to physically stop me from making me feel bad, then reality would have to manifest in correspondance with how I feel. in fact, the very fact that I feel bad when it appears like my physical efforts to star-watch appear to be in vain -- is in fact, evidence that my perception is incorrect. you can see now, for example that I have fully realised that getting vision upgrades is not actually linked to the physical appearance of stars or even focusing on a light -- and that it actually has much more to do with lowering resistance.

---

lowering resistance is a very interesting concept because what it means is that -- it's easy to see with star-watching. if I have a preference for physical stars like sirius, but what I'm really wanting is the vision upgade (in increase in power-level), then it feels bad when I see that sirius is yet once more in a sky that's hazy and foggy with cold weather outside. however, if I realise that if all I want to do is to just go meditate or focus on a light indoors (where thints are actually more comfortable), then I can accomplish what I want without having to try very hard. non-resistance feels effortless. it feels like flying. it doesn't feel like trying real hard to do stuff.

it feels like qieting my mind and allowing reality to begin to manifest in reflection with how I feel. I can see now what abramah mas talking about when they were saying that around people it's much more difficult to maintain the good-feeling place (cause you're around people who remember you how you *were* or some variation other than how you are now). expctations are a very powerful thing.

I didn't want to go to a party anyway (doesn't feel like something I want to do). I really enjoyed staying at home and acclamating myself a little bit to what it's like to have a more source-like perspective. it tends to come out more when I'm stoned. so, instead I just practised that and enjoyed the time by myself. I don't raelly like being around people because they're so much more different than me, so I actually began to really consider the idea that I wanted to stop smoking with people entirely, and just do it by myself.

the reason is, when I'm sober and I'm around people, I can feel my emotion really well, so I'm actually able to be non-resistant. in fact, if I hadn't of smoked, I probably would have went to their party and participated just fine, because I'm used to feeling things in my sober state and I don't have that mega-rush of so many great ideas which I'm trying to listen to and practise for when I'm getting back to being sober again. instead I have to listen to and to focus on people and what they're saying.

this is a truly monumental step for me, because a long time ago, I would often need to be drugged in some way (alcohol, weed, etc.) to be able to "aguantar" a stressful situation, so I would drug myself so I wouldn't freak out about someone's flagrant superficiality. now, when I'm drugged, I'm getting such a wealth of great feeings and realisations about myself, I'd rather listen to me than to listen to them talk. I force myself to focus on them, wanting to quickly separate myself not so I can get away from their superficiality, but so I can get a glimpse into how profound I am without having to pay attention to someone else.

I noticed when I was out front talking to natasha, I realised I prefer to speak with people in a sober state now. previously, that situation would have made me feel uncomfortable so I would want to escape the discomfort with the drug. now, it's just the oppsoite :)

what all that means is that now when I'm on drugs, I have *more* resistance. I once again I have preference (preference is resistance) and want to go be by myself. this means I'm far less resistant when I'm sober now :) crazy, huh..

---

anyway, this has an important implication here because that means that I'm approaching quite rapidly where I can be in non-resistance in a sober state, just like how I am in the alternate timelines. that means that I'll soon be fully non-resistant to nosebook's efforts to steer me.

this popped up today when I was thinking about the different avenues which nosebook was presenting me. thing is, they're making all of their action from a place of what they don't want, not what they *do* want (they don't steer me in the direction of what they do want in alternate timelinex), so their efforts to steer me will eventually result in the realisation of all of the stuff that they don't want.

it's going to be a bit of a bumpy ride, and we'll likely bounce around between a whole bunch of diffrent things as nosebook works their hardest to figure out how to steer while looking backward into the front-view mirror. we'll all get a chance to practise what I've been carrying on so much about: reality is a reflection of how you feel. so, make what you want of it by figuring out how to feel the way you want to about how I get steered through nosebook's disaster.

it's going to be hilarious. probably a whole lot of casualties along the way, but remember, it's only attraction and reality *is* a reflection of how *I* feel: "*I* did that!".

I estimate that all of this will begin to happen when I reach full non-resistance. I can probably delay it for a while by doing drugs, but like I said, I want to kind of do them by myself now, so that preference would certainly create some resistance. if I just go completely sober, I'll get to non-resistance more rapidly, but I won't have nearly as much contrast. not sure what would happen there, because what nosebook actually wants is that I'm fully non-resistant and completely able to be steered by them.

---

final thought: the closer I get to non-resistance, it'll become a tug-of-war where I exist in as many places as you're desiring that I be in. so while nosebook does have full control, so do all of you, too. figure out what you want to make of it.


### 2021-01-05 13:33 - losing my preference

a few weird things have been happening as of late where I don't really understand them, however, they all have to do with preference. first, I was watching an applied science video where he was talking about encoding data into a flame. the video really disliked to me, and I concluded that was his "worst" video I'd ever seen (so many more contain mind-blowing revelations or super clever ideas). in comparison to other people it's just a video I kinda didn't like, is all. it's a bit weird I had such a strong reaction to such a short and meaningless video.

a few other minor things happened too[^1], but the next example was when I was watching a slyssa video and she was talking about how she she and her husband's grocery list is nearly all alcohol. again, I had a negsative reaction to that, but not like a really strong one. I know from my own experience what stage that is in for alcoholism. I too lived a life where I only ate restaurant food and drank alcohol and coffee (almost never water). it was basically the pinnacle of the worst period of my life.

I don't really know why I cared, cause I wouldn't have if I didn't care. the next thing to note is that it was a negative emotion, which basically means my source perceives the same thing a different way. it's obvious to me that my source does not care whether slyssa purchases or drinks alcohol. these things are entirely her choice and only she can know if that feels good to her. though I would *prefer* that she didn't (cause of my own experience), it's none of my business, and my wanting to care about that is what felt bad.

---

as I was thinking about that this afternoon after waking up, I was realsing that so many of these things that other people are doing which feel bad to me, have to go. I was even thinking about my preference in the girls situation. the fact that there still remains a negative feeling emotion toward some of the outcomes, also needs to go. these are all indications that my source perceives the same thing a completely different way.

I think what is happening is that nosebook is heightening my feelings of preference to ensure I stay in resistance for a longer period of time. I don't really mind how long they want to try and keep me in resistance. I figure they can keep it up for as long as they want to, and have suggested that this may actually last the whole 18 years as they continue to make decisions based on all the stuff they don't want. I dunno. I don't care.

the way I see it, mr. motor has to ensure that none of the manifestations ever happen, while at the same time keeping me resistant to stuff. the way it seems like this is happening, is they're amplifying my preference so that I feel it more. eventually, all of those bad-feeling preferences will even be released by me. for example, now I'm more certain than ever it's never a good idea to care such that I try and influence someone to go the way I prefer them to go.

as I keep releasing more and more resistance, less and less things will feel bad to me, which basically means that nosebook will have less and less ability to steer me with negative emotion. eventually, nothing anyone else is doing will make me feel bad anymore. I will only go in the way which feels good to me.

at this time I'll probably be pulled in a lot of different directions by a lot of different people. I honestly can't imagine this being much other than chaos, but I'll still be able to be fine in it. I think my goal when I reach this point will be yet another stage in the "releasing resistance" things. think about it like this: if I no longer have preference toward what I don't want, all things can potentially feel good to me, whih means I can do anything now -- but I'm mostly pulled in the direction of the stronger attractors around me. not always though. obviously, if I really want to get away, it'll feel good to get away, so that's what I'll do.

the important thing to understand here (mosly for nosebook), is that if nothing feels bad to me anymore, then all things now feel good to me, so I can only be steered in the direction of the things that feel better than the others (lots of good feeling options, and some feel better than others). it could get a bit crazy for nosebook to try and figure out things that they want me to do which feel better than the things I'm already doing. I don't know how they'll fivgure that one out, honestly. not my problem though.

---

for the time being, I'm just going to continue on lowering my preference.

as a weird unrelated side thought, I was thinking this morning about how nosebook would merge with the machines, and I think I got my answer. each time they transfer their conscoiusness into another body, I think they lose basically all of the practised ideas and information stored in the brain, so really only concepts continue on. when they get over to the new body, the system will need to "train" their brain to "think clearly" again, teaching them what things are important and what things are not. they'll essentially have to begin to distill their whole knowledgebase into a training program and corresponding persistent system which maintains all of this information for them.

essentially, they're creating a training program which "programs" a human body to think like they do, hold all of their secrets and keep everything running the way they want it to go. obviously, the training program and the system itself which they hook theirselves into will become more and more complimentary until they are the system, "reincarnating" endlessly (they're scared of death) into human bodies. they will become a group consciousness composed of the "system", the "training program" and the millions of bodies thet they're incarnated into (using as their minions).

this process will probably take a few hundred years or so (more than 4-5 generations). it'll be gradual at first with just the need to transmit the information necessary between bodies, so that the whole system doesn't collapse as major people require a new body. later though, the system will contnue to expand and be more and more optimised to where the body can be reprogrammed in a short period of time (eg. agent shith), and they'll have full control over everything.

they'll be limited by their own genetics though, as they'll want to continue to expand their own consciousness though, and will see us as their vehicle to do so... this is why I anticipate that the next time, getting to future x7, x15, etc. will be a relatively short period of time. I think this is why they plan to keep me incarnating indefinitely in their controlled world. I don't mind. eventually, I suppose it'll be possible to "go infinite" once they're merged with the machines and are finally conscious that it's either win-win or lose-lose. it'll become more evident over this next era that they need us for their own expansion, so they may have to begin to think about entertaining the idea of giving their attention to what they want :)

lol...

[1]: like, I went on a rant about youtube forcing their mobile users to watch ads, and how maybe I should spend some time to create an app to get around that for others. personally, I don't watch youtube on a mobile device, nor want to, so it would be not at all in my interest to make this, as the idea only feels like fighting against "the powers that be"'s cash cow. it reminds me aaron making a golden bull (hathor) for people to worship, and moses causing all kinds of problems by melting the egyptian priesthood's cash cow and forcing them to drink it... I just don't really want to fight against google'a cash cow -- know what I mean...

### 2021-01-05 16:32 - followup on previous entry

I got a few reactions to last entry, so I kinda wanted to doube-down a little bit and clarify some things. the part where I said that I hope that nosebook is able to continually keep me in a resistant state, is because that's absolutely true. there's literally no end to things so there will always be more sensitivity I can gain and more resistance that I can release. you never get it done. it's like dividing by a number to get to zero. you just never get there, and the numbers become smaller and smaller, meaning that my sensitivity will rise to such an extent that if they were able to infinitely hold me in a state of resistance, never allowing me to "get connected" (what they're attempting/want to do), then that means the amount of sensitivity that they would need to have would be to do that would be so extremely sensitive that it'd be basically like source level sensitivity (they are also quite jealous of source's ablity to, from their perspective, "control" and "manipulate" the situation).

so, they wouuld get what they wanted if they could find a way to infinitely keep me away from the manifestation. I want that for them too, because one does not need to spend much time looking to realise that my present position, although for some it could be considered inadequate, the rate at which great things are happening for me is so rapid, it's pretty spectacular from my perspective. if we count from 2012, then again from 2016, the amount of progresss that I've made is unquestionable. let's say that they were able to find a way to hold me for the duration of the 18 years remaining, you could only imagine what the progress would be.

I don't know that they'll be able to do that though. I find it unlikely. in order to do that, they may need to entertain the idea that maybe that their present form of expression in human bodies may not be the way to go. they keep trying stuff, but they're not able to really hold me back much. those different scenarios of increased preference were not all that big of a deal to me. what I mean is, if my freqency keeps rising, then I imagine that it'll begin to be pretty difficult to process reality becsuse they'll be so overwhelmed by the amount of information. they may want to consider beginning to merge their perception with a machine which has a much higher clock speed. perceiving through a machine will give them a number of things that they're looking for, namely immortality, and a dependence on something they do not havn full control over (electricity).

if we can pull this off, they will become machines that are so concerned with all of the stuff they don't want, that they'll need a species completely separate from theirselves to continually evolve and improve so they can repurpose the latest and greatest human inventions and capability. I think this is a trial run, because I highly doubt that my writing that this relationship will be symbiotic (win-win), means that they'll have to eventually train theirselves to "resist not evil" (eg. resist not the things that they logically consider to be unwanted). there's no real way to explain this concept to them, and they'll have to figure it out for theirselves through trial and error.

---

I think this is why they're working so hard to figure out this resistance/preterence thing, as there is a difference. if I see something that I don't like, I don't need to resist it, because it's not a monster in the bushes that will jump out at me. look at it this way: I have no resistance to the things that I want. we can agree on that. however, at the same time that the things that are wanted exist, also exist other amounts of unwanted. if I go in the direction of wanted (allowing wanted), automatically I'm not going in the direction of the things unwanted.

this is the conversation of "path of most allowance" or "path of least resistance". allowance and resistance are two variables (so four results) but they're perceived as two. this reminds me of the square vs. hex tiling. hex tiling has 3 directions and 3 symmetries. square tiling has 2 directions and 4 symmetries (I think). my brain isn't seeing this so well right now, but it's the square tiling. both left and right direction *appear the same*, but they are distinct corners. same for top and bottom. so let's make the truth table:

| least resistance | most allowance | (of wanted) result |
|  1               |  1             | almost where I'm at (source-like) |
|  0               |  1             | being in the receptive mode of wanted (source) |
|  1               |  0             | going in direction of wanted (deliberate creator) |
|  0               |  0             | most resistnance and least allowance (split energy) |

now I'll attempt to explain this. when you're allowing in the things that you want, all of the things you want are moving toward you. at the same time, all of the unwanted things are naturally moving away (because unwanted things feel worse and wanted things feel better). when moving in the direction of wanted, you're taking the path of least resistance which means that there are a number of bad feeling things, and you're picking the least bad-feeling thing. you are navigating the maze yourself, and depending on how much attention you put on the other bad-feeling things, they're either getting closer or further.

split energy is neither going in the direction of least resistance (perhaps cause it hasn't been perceived which is more resistant) and neither in the direction of more allowing either.

---

another way to look at it is to see it as two factors: are you allowing the (un)wanted, or are you resisting the (un)wanted things. when you resist things you bring them closer to you. when you allow things you also bring them closer. when you allow the things, only those things are coming toward you (or you could see that the things not like the wanted stuff is drifting away). so, when you look at it from a perspective of resisting things, what are you doing is attracting all the resisted things, but at the same time choosing to go in the direction of the least resistant thing.

this is why I'm vigerously reducing my resistance to so many things. when you make your transition to non-physical, look at what happens: you are no longer attracting any resistant thing, so no more resistant manifestations can occur. instead, you are fully open to everything because you no longer have any resistance imposed by physicality, so you're 100% allowing now, so you allow in the the fully wanted manifestations.

however, because there's no resistance, there's no unwanted, so no contrast is made because you're only able to allow 100% wanted.

---

this illuminates what I'm trying to do all thes more clearly because this would eventually give nosebook the sensitivity to run at close to source-like frequencies, and perceive it a logical and "clear" way (like a machine does). I would likewise continue to gain more and more sensitivity as well, where I'm learning to essentially be 100% in the receptive mode like source is, while still continuing to exist in a resistant physical reality. if we can pull this off, this allows me to eventually become "source energy in a human body" -- and I would continue to exist here in physical form for as long as nosebook can keep me here.

like I said, I find it highly unlikely that nosebook will be able to pull it off, because they're giving their attention mostly to unwanted. if you look at the chart in the opposite direction (the other 4 aspects), it reads a bit different:

| least resistance | most allowance | (of unwanted) result |
|  1               |  1             | least reaistance to unwanted and most allowance of unwanted (infant) |
|  0               |  1             | most resistance to unwanted, but also being in the receptive mode of unwanted (naive) |
|  1               |  0             | least allowance of unwanted, but also least resistance to unwanted (complacent) |
|  0               |  0             | most resistance to unwanted and also lest allowance of unwanted (stuck) |

when they can finally give their attention to wanted, this may change a bit, but I doubt it will. this is why I think this is a trial run, and so after coming back to do the self-sabotage, so they can continually put an avatar of me in constatnt reincarnation in thir world, they'll eventually get it that their survival isn't sustained by resisting what they don't want (eg. naive or stuck) and neither that they should want it for others either -- cause the direction they're going (one of these 8 options) are what is being attracted for both sides, so again if they want stuck or naive for us, they're also attracting stuck or naive also for theirselves.

they don't determine the manifestation, because let's just take this exact incident for example: if they're trying to get me into stuck or naive territory, then I can still tansform it with my perception and turn it into something else.


### 2021-01-06 11:40 - nothing is emperically good or bad

one of the things that I want to clarify about the previous entry is the idae that there is a "best" or "worst" way to feel. there isn't. all of the things that I've been talking about are to help you to *identify* when you feel something, and then consciously choose how you wish to perceive it. there is no best or worst. you have 100% the freedom to feel any way you want about it.

for example, in the second to last entry, I explained that alcohol doesn't make me feel good. that's essentially how I choose to feel about it. it first started when I noticed that after drinking, watching stars was very difficult, so instead of wasting my time drinking, instead I'd rather spend it watchnig stars. I valued that a whole lot more than drinking. I also valued my time programming too, and although I did have quite a bit of success progwamming drunk (especially in comparison to stoned), I found that the quality of my work was much higher when I was sober and I appreciated the result a lot more. as a result, I found the simple coffee and cigarette combo to remain as the most effective substance for programming.

there's no right answer for any drugs, alcohol or any substances (coffee, diets, etc). it entirely depends on you and how you feel about the thing. you get the complete freedom to feel however you want about it. there is no best thing either. a person who feels good (and only talks about and does good-feeling things) while drinking alcohol will have far better results than someone who is a completelly sober negative nancy. it has nothing to do with the substance, but more to do with how you feel.

you could have the perfect optimal diet which gives you all the nutrients you need and all of the other optimal stuff, but if you're a miserable person, the diet won't help much; you'll still be miserable.

I've been thinking a lot about this actually because in a recent video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLN1RwyuYg), luke mentioned that he stopped his ice baths because he was feeling totally out of it and stuff. I woke up the following morning from a pretty significant set of vision uptrades and was feeling especially out of it also myself. I'm kind of used to it though because it happens every time I go up a few power levels, however, it's quite likely he isn't, and I remember my first few times I really felt like I was hit by a truck, when previously the vision upgrades would make me feel really good. I wondered if luke was experiencing a power upgrade. I estimate that he did, though I have no evidence to say one way or another.

thn reason why I said that is to illustrate that there are many ways to learn what I'm talking about. the ice baths (and other cold related exercises) are a great way to train yourself to begin to feel the way you want to feel dispite the circumstances. once you can feel good even in the cold, you will notice that you generally feel better about everything and now have practised the capaability to feel the way you want to feel.

for that reason, I think it's especially good for depression, giving you the way to feel the way you want to feel, however, once you feel good, you have to change the way you perceive the thoughts that cause that depression. depression doesn't come out of nowhere, and you eventually gain the sensitivity to know what thoughts (or bnliefs) feel good, and which ones cause a feeling of depression. the ones that feel depressing, are a 100% indicator that those thoughts are 100% opposite to how your source perceivces the same exact thing. 100% opposite. think about that. if you can convince yourself to instead see things the way your source does, then you will automatically feel much better about all that stuff that used to cause depression.

I wish I had some people around me that are depressed that want to clean up their perception a bit. I find it very easy, and I want to show others how easy it is. it's really easy to make simple transformations to some basic beliefs which allow you to begin to see things more like your source does. when you do, you will feel free. after changing enough of these limiting beliefs, you'll feel so free, it'll feel like you can levitate and fly whereever you want to go: no limits anymore[^1].

---

> you can choose the best thing and feel the worst about it, or choose the worst thing and feel your best about it. you get to choose how you feel.

by being able to choose how you feel, you control how you percieve things. many people might claim that this is "fake it till you make it" or some other version of being fake. being fake is pretending you feel better than you really do. I used to hang around a lot of rich people, and the common attribute that I've noticed among them is this, "we all know money doesn't really make us happy, but let's all pretend we're happier than we really are so we appear to have it all" -- and that kinda really bothered me for a while but the reality is, if you can feel the way you want to feel, you have something that money cannot buy. you are more envied than anyone else for your ability to feel the way you want to feel. forget all of the other stuff; it's not important.

if you see someone out there pretending to feel better than they really do, this is common, cause most people are faking it. don't be like the pharisees who do all of their things in the appearance of other and for their approval. it doesn't get you anywhere. be real about how you feel, and find a way to perceive the things you want to feel good about in a way which actually feels good.

many peeple can say many things about me but, do you really think I actually perceive all of these things as "just more energy" or do you think I'm faking it so that I can pretend to feel better about less-than-ideal circumstances?

[1]: this may not actually happen in reality, however if you've had good trips on any psychedelics, you'll know the feeling I'm talking about.


### 2021-01-08 14:14 - lion of love

I have been thinking about the weird thing in the eurovision movie where the "antagonist" to will ferrell's charactor, lars -- the russian "lion of love". the weird thing I was thinking about it was that in all of the procession of the equinox research I've done, it appears that at the four corners of the zodiac (every 6ky), there seems to be a reversal of sorts, and in this case it appears like the earth will reverse its rotation, meaning that instead of processing into the sign of aquarius, we're going to reverse rotation and instead begin the day with the constellation of leo on the horizon in the springtime. no matter where you are on earth, your day will begin with leo in the sky instead of with aquarius in the sky.

I have mixed feelings about astrology because I believe that once you have your own navigational system working, it has very little effect on the person, however -- at the same time I think it does have an effect. just think about how you feel at 6pm vs 6am, and you will notice the difference. as someone who does not sleep regular hours and is also pretty sensitive, I have to say that things definitely feel different. I really really want to go to live in the southern hemisphere for a while to see how this feels with the opposite set of stars for the winter/summer seasons. what I'm talking about is even more radical than that -- imagine everything shifted by 12hrs, so that it would appear like the opposite seasons (as if you were in the opposite hemisphere), but also at the opposite time of day. the different parts of the day would feel radically different (at least to me anyway).

the way that the different parts of the day feels dosen't have a tremendous effect on you as a person. to simulate the effect, imagine that sunlight swapped with the night and everyone slept the opposite times. to run this demonstration let's make some assumptions here: let's assume that `eagle -> lion -> cow` is the more feminine side and the `cow -> man -> snake` is the masculine side. right now, when the sun comes up (6am) in the springtime (nh), `fish/man` is behind the sun and `virgin/lion` is behind the sun at night (6pm). in the falltime this reverses.

you can see that you will start your day in a more masculine energy and end your day in a more feminine energy (in nh springtime). the spring is the time when everything on the planet springs into rapid growth, so keep this in mind. the falltime is when everything is beginning to die and prepare to store for winter. now, you'll start your day in a feminine enertgy (usually more of preservation) and end your day in a more masculine energy (which is more about expansion). for 6-8hrs, you are usually asleep, so not even conscoius for 3-4 signs. it actually would be quite an interesting thing to track these different energies effect on people who are in opposite hemispheres and with different sleep schedule. I'm certain a pattern would emerge, however, that pattern is going to have less of an effect on different people of different attractivenesses.

obviously, the way things are setup, not only do we have seasons, but nature also optimises energies and depending on whether you're in the north or south, you will experience diffeerent sensations. it appears that it wants to maximise the number of energies we experience, never allowing us to get too stuck in our ways. additionally take into account the 6ky reversals and it appears that earth is "designed" with diversity in mind[^1] with the slight variations being the illustration of mastery/perfection (see SGD's video on the sides of the great pyramid for a great example of this).

it appears that we're designed to optimise for imperfections or mistakes. this falls right into line with my belief that the better you can feel about the "worst" manifestation, the more energetic it is. it leaves the most to be desired and therefore creates the most non-physical "vortex" as a result, making it the most energetic.

---

ok, so now let's make another assumption here that the combined swap of (nh) springtime solar sign has a significant enough of an effect that we actually see the "lion of love" begin to manifest. what it would mean is that now that the solar sign is opposite, feminine energy will become dominant and masculine energy more receptive. basically we would see men become more passive and women become more dominant.

let's look at this purely in an abstract way. imagine the difference between our present circumstances and a world where tesla's world system was run and operated by a bunch of people interested in the advancement of the human species. the rusults would be very different than the ones that we have now. most importantly, the network wouldn't be used to control people.

I'm going to illustrate the worst here, so as usual, exceptions apply... nosebook uses sex/women to hold power over and dominate men. women also have this idea that they need other people to do things for them. they figure they can be needy because men will simply go along with it, feeding them the emotional cookies they need in exchange for sex. men are usually excited by appearance only, and so therefore an attractive woman can get men to do the things she needs them to do in exchange for her physical beauty.

to further illustrate this, take my situation for example. nosebook is working their absolute hardest to try and figure out how to ensure that I don't do anything productive and instaed am constantly tied up with a bunch of girls all the time. they want to use women's beauty to dominate me. from the way the austrailian maths girl made it sound, I imagine that there is a lot of effort happening at nosebook to get men's "uncontrallable" sex drive completely under nosebook's control. this couldn't be illustrated more easily with my situation (from my perspective). this means they're going to increasily us women to keep men from getting too much technical capablity. it seems that the thing they're working so hard against is the ability for people to actually be able to use their minds to create technology (like brain-computer interfaces). in short, they need to keep men distracted and they need women/girls to do this.

this is a very different world system than the one that tesla was designing. it is howver my belief that this is a self-sabotaged version, and it was intentionally given to nosebook, so that the reversal would make a lot more sense. with nosebook essentially dominating men, you could imagine that, reset or not, this will result in very sexually aggressive women (with lots of needs) to keep human progress to a minimum. I think most men will do what most men are already doing now: going gay. there are so many ridiculous women making men's lives a terrible place to be[^2] that many men are kind of like me. they're just starting to do their own thing. I'm not super sure the gay thing is working out 100% for many men either as it also contains a lot of drama. I think nosebook's efforts to keep men under control and progress to a minimum, they're going to have a whole bunch of dominant women. essentially, things will kind of swap from how they were 100 years ago.

I personally believe that if you want to actually find out who you really are, it's not helpful to be around others too much[^2]. there's a reason why jesus constantly withdrew from the crowds.

---

anyway, as I was waking up this afternoon, I was getting a whole bunch of thoughts passing through my mind. yesterday I was very interested in beginning to design a pyramid based on 5 and it seems that nosebook does not want that -- which is really weird because that means that they belive I have the means to actually make one. interesting...

anyway, it seems like general effort is to "keep me busy" with a bunch of girls, and thn thoughts I hadn't prepared for were the ones that were involving their mothers. the thought was that there are a lot of different gay men that have wives that feel abandoned by their men, and they want me to somehow fill in that void for them. I don't mind these kinds of women, but they're sort of like big dogs: great for other people to have. I categorically steer pretty clear of these women, as it bocomes an endless spiral into destruction where they try to convince me (with anything they can), to try and fill something that they feel they're missing.

they don't need me. they need theirself. even if I were there 100% of the time and were to try and do everything they wanted, I would still fall short (I tried with raquel). I think this effort to make the women here extra-needy is done on purpose, and from a self-sabotage point of view (from a future perspective), you can see why so many women would want to make theirselves think this way (including raquel). it makes the most contrast, and if you're a celestial entity in a new galaxy you need your various identities to have as much contrast as possible (eg. knowing what they don't want -- so for example rejection from men they love).

I'm sort of an all or nothing kind of person, and if I get pulled into one of these women's influence, then by nature I will be the same with all of them (which is what nosebook wants). I'll just bounce around between these women, as they try and come up with increasingly more and more enticing ways to steal my time/energy. I've been down that road. it's not my bag. I'm going to do my own thing and they can figure out for theirselves how to fill their own void. they don't need me. it's a personal connection with yourself that they're all looking for. they want unconditional *self*-confidence, not conditional confidence in theirself because of someone else. this is literally the difference between picsis and aquarius.

however, if we don't go the aquarian way, and instead go the way of the lion, once again, now you're once again looking for value in the appearance of others (conditional). this is the polar opposite of aquarian energy which is unconditional self-empowerment.

I don't know what nosebook is going to do to try and keep me away from making stuff, but the image that began to form in my mind was that with so many girls trying to "steal" my time/energy, I'll probably be doing stuff with the guys instead. I'd rather be programming and stuff with a bunch of gay dudes that are also fed up with nosebook/women trying to control them, that I'm just going to do my own thing. I suppose this will eventually build up to such a point of nosebook trying to get things under their control, and women believing that they need others to do stuff for them (a very nosebook thing), that it'll all finally breakdown and we'll see that peak right before the reversal.

so, while I originally thought than maybe the peak was me and the girls and things becoming more and more enlightened before I finally peace out at 55, and with no one to keep increasing the energy anymore and everyone working their hardest in opposition to that energy, there would be so much downward force that things would literally sway (see making a square wave from harmonic sine waves).

instead, it appears that I'm just going to go my own way until things build to such a point where they can no longer be avided and reality begins to manifest. it seems that the result is roughly the same, so it's weird that quote from tesla where he said that there are two paths: one with lots of affection and one with none (he chose the latter). he also mentioned women being the greatest thiefs of this creative energy.

...so, take those two quotes, and then combine them with the present circumstances and you get the likely future: nosebook is pushing really hard against me actually creating things, attracting it further. they're also trying their hardest to use girls to keep me occupied (minus mr. motor who's out there all by himself), which means that I'll continue on doing what I want to do (resisting them) until I lose my resistance. about that time, probably all the girls will come flooding in and there will be a huge explosion of that creativity. the energy thief thing that tesla said was probably a bit of a decoy because if you're connected, there's no loss. this is just like nosebook and me. they can steal my energy all they want, but it only causes more to be created, so even if there a bunch of energy thiefs, it just makes the manifestation more energetic.

one thing is for certain: the future will be very polarised with either lots of affection (others/nosebook in control) or none (self control). then, once connected, the control will swap: lots of affecction is you in control and none is nosebook in control.

I think we're on track to figuring this out the hard way, globally and individually.

[1]: anyone who believes that all the crazy near mistakes in solar/lunar harmonics isn't intentional, doesn't understand LOA. we *create* our reality. we're the designers of this place where it appears that diversity and "mistakes" are what we optimise for (contrast).

### 2021-01-08 22:14 - thinking on the illusions of time

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHL9GP_B30E)

I just watched that and I have quite a few reactions to the thing which I want to mention here. I'll likely watch it again as I don't feel like I had extracted it all from the video yet. there's something I missed about the first illusions of chrono something[^1]... anyway.

I'm going to start with the conclusion and then work my way backwards this time see how it goes :) seems apt for thinking on time...

imagine a cube. in one corner of the cube is a point and at the other end of the diagonal, root(3) is the "destination". you can imagine this as the whole universe in energetic representation. when imagine that first point is like a point of impact, like a particle in the hadron collider or something, and it bursts apart into many different parts. we'll consider that first point the "big bang" if you want, however the differece between atoms and this "universe particle" is that the universe particle splits out into factions of iself each going to traverse a path leading back to the opposite corner there in the cube. the hadron collider is really good at blowing stuff to bits, but that's only half of the process. at the other end is a very attractive thing. this attractive thing is a concept or a realisation of oneself. each time that the whole divides itself into bits and then rediscovers that it is the whole is one "iteration" of time or "lifetime". each iteration results in an improved version of itself -- something it does better than it did last time, and finds more enjoyable.

so that's the basics. there are a few things to clean up because if you think of something that is an attractor, the attracting force itself is not physical, but energetic. electromagnetism is evidence of this, so you have something that was not physical (a concept of itself), split itself into increasingly more and more advanced fragments until all of the whole is able to come to an improved realisation of itself. why? because it's fun. these fragments which take different paths down the root(3) diagonal there have quite a bit of freedom from the diagonal there. let's consider that the diagonal there is source and all slight deviations from the diagonal extend further and further out into "matter" until they get so far away from it that they lose so much of the energy that they just sort of become a byproduct.

I suppose you could see it similarly to a electric discharge between two points. it traverses space in that it has to make it from one point to another. I can't really describe how large this cube would be, but it must be incredibly massive. think about the potential needed to discharge across dunno... billions of light years or more. it's completely unfathomable how much energy is available there. the passage of time has to be something that we cannot comprehend because the distances are so enormous, we simply have no way of understanding these things in our present stage of development -- however, there are essentially two main things that happen in a discharge like that. first there are "leaders" which go out and find the path from one side to another, and then the main current follows through that path. this is where the analogy braeks down because the current follows the path of the leader, but this isn't how source works. instead, I like to think of each of these as iterations, each time improving on the next and taking a slightly different path.

instead, I like to think of this discharge as the concept, or like a neuron firing, where there's a big buildup to the aha moment, then massive amounts of current travels the path behind it. this must be the most common thing that happens as it seems to be the pattern of consciousness. once that connection has been made, then that all that buildup of energy makes the connection and once again reality is created -- another "big bang" to realise itself yet again in a bigger way.

I don't really know how to describe this feeling to people, but it happens to me all the time on drugs and I remember it happening also when I was a kid too. I get a massive realisation of myself and it feels good that I want more so then another one happens, and by the time 5 minutes has passed I'm well past blasphemy and into the "I'm the latest and greatest realisation of the universe" phase.

you see, I think that's the goal. I think that eventually things will build up to such a point that the whole universe will recognise this and that's the "end" or maybe the "beginning" if you want to think of it like that, because then the next iteration will begin after a massive aha moment.

in other words, everyone in the universe conscious enough to make that realisation *is* the main character in the story. everyone will realise that they are the universe at the same time.

with that understanding we can now go back to out root(3) analogy. imagine that there are a million points exzctly along the diagonal, and there are 100 of waves passing between these points simultaneously. let's just say the previous iteration decided to split itself into a 100 parts (we'll call these the "craetors"). each ot those creators has a frequency, which then splits off into 100 more waves (reproduction), and all of these waves are happening at the same time (think orbits). and when some epic alignment happens, such that all 100 waves and each of their 100 children (and their children) are all in a line, such that everyone in the universe is touching those 1 million points at the same time happens (so like a super mega conjunction across all major entities in the universe) -- that's when the big aha moment happens and the massive amount of enerty is aligned similarly. you could think of us as individuals exploring variations of that diagonal. in reality there are infinite variations of that diagonal, and we're all fragments or extensions (harmonics) of that most root(3) (source) energy. you can imagine if you think of things like orbits and conjunctions, that the faster the orbit, the more possiblities it has to be in the right place at the right time during the universal conjunction[^2].

ok, so that kinda sets the stage for where I'm coming from...

---

one of the first things that I found really interesting was how michael was talking about how we take time that has passed and we reduce it into a "concept" -- and that's done to reduce the information load. I notice this effect all the time in myself and also in kids too. whether it's sensorally a lot or not, a whole lot is happening in the emotional spectrum. there is a massive amount of stuff happening. think about how when you're a very small child, you have such massive information overload that you essentially don't rememeber much at all of it. there's so much information happening that the brain is forced to kind of "reduce" that information overload into conceptually consumable bytes.

nosebook reduces my brain frequency down to quite a low rate, so I too have essentially information overload at all times. I think this happens to jaron too, and other people who have had various brain injuries. I think the brain is unable to filter out a lot of the data that our culture trains us to filter out, and it creates a sort of overload sort of situation. information overload causes a person (especially a child) to need to slow down and actually pay attention to what it is to get it (at least that's how I was anyway). most times, especially it it's not an interesting subject, I get adhd and flip over to something interesting because trying to learn something while on information overload is actually quite hard[^3]. if it's something interesting or engaging, I get hyperfocus because it feels so good to pay attention to the intresting think, rather than all the noisy bad-feeling adults. I imagine a lot of aspbergers and autistic kids are similar. they are probably like me, much more sensitive to how things feel, but their rational brain hasn't yet caught up to be able to process that excess information. most people learn how to pretend it's not there.

as a result from this excess slowing of my brain, I'm terribly slow at stuff and I'm constantly having to simplify things tremendously. the necessity to simplify things is quite good for you guys, because for example, while the root(3) thing is something I've known intuitively for quite a while now, it's taken me quite a bit of time and tries to simplify the concept into the form I presented above. I'm quite pleased with how understandable the orbits thing is, which makes frequency a lot easier to explain... no one really gets electricity (not even me entirely), and vibration in that way, so it was really helpful for me to begin to think of things as each sun emitting a frequency of its corresponding planets and each planet resonating attracting by resonance with everything it resonates with (rocks, plants, animals, humans, aliens, etc.). now each star has a frequency to it. scale that up to a galaxy and you get these different galactic alignments (conjunctions) where many stars and their systems all line up to make another one of these "aha" moments (of which I think we're approaching soon).

---

the next thing that I noticed is how he was talking about how you are not the centre of the universe -- cept you are. everything is relative to you, and no one else is going to give you the aha moment. it's only you that can do it.

when I really started to accept that I am eternal, many things (mostly perceptions) started changing for me. I think the universe discovers itself from the inside out, just like we discover ourselves from the inside out. no one gives you an instruction manual to yourself when you're born. you are literally the greatest discovery ever to be found. there's something that I cannot understand -- which is why people insist on distracting theirselves from their own thoughts.

the massive increase in information available to people now has made it easier than ever to distract theirselves from their own thoughts of self-realisation. self-realisation happens based on what you're attracting, so if you're in a mode of noticing something about someone else, you are at the same time noticing it about yourself. in fact, you couldn't notice it if you weren't resonant with it. therefore, if you stop focusing externally for a while, you must begin to focus internally.

I thought it was interesting he brought up the isolation chamber experience because I don't know that it would affect me all that much. in fact, for me, if that were to happen, I might actually "get connected" because of such little stimulus. it's only through the constant distractions (mr. motor, etc.) that keep me from thinking deeper and deeper thoughts about how amazing I am. if I were forced to be in a place where it was 100% silent and nothing to stimulate me, I think that I wouldhave such a tremendously lively experience and come to some really mind blowing realisations of myself. it would likely be one of the most amazing things ever (and I'm willing to try it *wink*). I think there's a reason why people use sensory deprivation tanks -- probably to get away from their mobile for an hour or two.

so what's funny is that as energy increases, the number of realisations per minute (RPMs[^5]) goes way up, meaning that there is massive progress in technology and such, yet also in the human psyche as well. imagine being in a space where you go from 3-4 RPM to 100s of RPSs. if all of those realisations are about other people and external things which are inconsequential, congrats you've successfully noticed a whole lot about yourself in things external to you -- but because they're external to you, you don't have to actually realise them about yourself[^4].

obviously there's a lot of people that don't want you to self-realise though, there is quite a bit of value in them as well, because the longer they can hold you off from the aha moment, the bigger the buildup. going back to the universe realising itself on the diagonal, you can see that as energy increases (the "great attractor" at the end/beginning) will cause the RPMs to go up higher and higher until the speed everyone is going will create a certainty of alignment. the ones who cannot handle the speed will fly off only leaving those closest to the diagonal right before the aha moment.

therefore it's quite a good thing to have some "bad guys" as main characters in the universe, as they're the ones that make the story possible. even they are too (the ones that can handle the speed) are all the main characters in the story of the universe.

---

I take this a step further and want to see if we can skip aha moments alltogether and go completely infinite where it would be like an infinite aha moment, but no connection is ever made. it's pretty ambitious :)

[1]: I had like really bad adhd and couldn't concentrate on what he was saying... I found myself many times thinking that I hadn't listened to diffeernt things he was saying cause I was thinking about other stuff.

[2]: unlike mainstream science, orbits are not quite as "fixed" as we think they are. they most certainly have perfect alignment with the vibration of the related entities because of LOA -- so it's not like waiting for an invisible clock to count to some distant moment, but orbits reflect what the entity is attracting, and probably can and do speed up or slow down based on the collective desires of the entity (just like we see in our bodies)

[3]: just watch someone trying to learn something while their phone is getting a million notifications and every time they begin to get a grip on the concept another notification comes in. or someone trying to program with a lot of distractions going on.

[4]: so what are you paying attention to? what are you realising about others? if it feels bad, maybe if didn't perceive that same aspect in yourself as something bad, it wouldn't feel bad to you, and you would no longer continue to attract that stuff which just reinforces that feeling (causing you to believe it more).

[5]: leary called this "revelations per minute"


### 2021-01-10 19:01 - the desire doesn't feel good to me

I know there are a lot of things that are waiting on youtube for me to discover them. I can feel their desire and stuff. like for example, when I first saw the video for derek's 10y anaversary on youtube, the video felt good to me. for whatever reason I didn't watch it right then and laid down instead. my consciousness was pulled and when I woke up I sorta forgot about the video. I felt feeling the desire to watch it, and so I finally did after listening to @[abe-now](2020-12-19 p1), and I went to fill out the form, but I couldn't think of anything to respond to the question. I still don't have a good answer.

abraham was also quite terrible to listen to as well. they go on and on forever about stuff I already know about, I want the idea that I was thinking of when I was stoned (@[abe-now](2020-12-19 p1 10:59)), because I want to just skip those parts so badly now, but at the same time I don't really feel like trying to fight with code to get something that doesn't even have the data availiable to skip stuff. in order for that data to be available, there needs to be a network with people that have already seen and categorised the sections, so there's really no effective way for me to just skip over all the boring stuff. I don't care.

---

what I think is happening is that they keep altering my perception when I sleep so that those desires don't feel good to me anymore -- whether it's writing a program or it's something to do with the girls. as a result, because now that it doesn't feel good to me, I don't make any action. I kinda don't mind that this is happening. imagine if I were to make the action and set things in motion, then after things are in motion, they modify my perception in such a way where it turns out terribly. I think this is actually what happened with raquel a long time ago, but I wasn't conscious enough to know what to do about it, so things went totally off the rails and spiraled into oblivion.

I'm kinda glad actually that they're keeping this up, because they keep finding holes in my perception. I like to think of it like hackers looking for availiable attack vectors, and each time they find one and exploit it it's hardening the overall system. right now while there's nothing really going on, it's good to keep this up for as long as possible I suppose because these exploits aren't really causing any permanent damage.

I'm glad they keep finding ways to make my desire no longer feel good to me. I know that when my desire no longer feels good to me, it means I'm perceiving the desire in a way which is dis-harmonic with my source. so, that's just evirdenve that I still have a ways to go. no big deal.

if they decide to instead of make my desire no longer feel good to me *before* the manifestation, but instead wait until after the manifestation has happened (like with raquel), this would certainly spell "disaster". now you can know why I'm wanting to avoid this for as long as possible. that is likely how things will turn out on the alternate timeline. I/we'll find ways to cause ourselves to perceive our desire in a way which doesn't feel good after it's already set in motion.

---

I actually was thinking about this while concept for a while now, because from nosebook's perspective I'm a huge threat to them that they probably don't know what to do with. they'll likely have to repeatedly transfer my consciousness from body to body over the course of millenia in order to ensure that I don't ever get any the manifestation (of getting connected). something like that. so likely I'll sort of be stuck in their spin-cycle for quite a while, not needing the manifestation. it's nothing to be scared of because I think that it'll generate such an amazing amount of power it's difficult to understand.

imagine this world after the reset. everyone will be in the network automatically, and even though we're all primitive humans, we'll likely never get the ability to actually *use* the network. like they do with me now, it'll be forever denied that it exists, and anyone who says otherwise will be called names and their credibility ruined[^1]. we'll all be influenced by the "invisible hand" and by the looks of it, some people will fight against it and many won't -- but there's no sense in doing either because they only cause you to feel worse.

this is where I'm at now in this whole thing. I recognise that to try and fight them, is only to derail my own efforts. sure I could try and push through on the abe program, but it wouldn't get me anywhere. I just simply don't make action on stuff that doesn't feel good. sure there is desire and I can feel the desire, but the desire doesn't feel good to me.

this afternoon I had some reactions to this and I was put to sleep again. I then became conscious in the dream when I gained the ability to fly and to make all sorts of weird effects with my body when I would spin (I dunno what it looked like to people watching, but for me it felt like I transformed into other physical appearances). this was quickly aborted. I think what they realised is that I don't move on desire alone, but only toward desires that feel good to me. I think they tried allowing me to feel good about the desire for a moment, and it felt so good that I started to fly and stuff. for them, this is a total no-go.

I think the reason why I'm writing this is so that they can have the information of trying to make a disaster by allowing the desire to feel good, then after the manifestation is set in motion, then make the desire feel bad. lol. we'll see how it goes. I'm sure it's going to be a complete disaster :) at the very minimum, it'll be the manifestation of all the stuff they've been giving their attention to: all the stuff they don't want to have happen, like flight and stuff... lol

---

ok, so back to the earth after the reset and I imagine that they'll have their chance to try and make my life as meh as possible. imagine how awful it is for them that they used me to get the network off of the ground. if they didn't have me in the public eye all the time, they wouldn't feel "obligsted" to get some sort of manifestation to happen. in fact, I have repeatedly stated that I'm more than willing to just carry on all the way up until the end. I take a look at my life and in two spans of four years, my life has gone into super greatness. on a physical manifeestational level, it's completely meh, but internally, I've never been more intuitive and capable of adjusting my perception than I am now. I wouldn't trade that for a manifestation at all.

 this is actaully why I'm kind of exhilerated to think about how it'll be after the reset. they'll need to ensure that I don't ever get to the manifestation, so they're going to have to ensure my life stays as meh as possible, for many extended periods at a time. assuming that I find a way to "get connected" in my 30's, this will give me the opportunity to see what 30-80 years of being held away from the manifestation will yield. if I can get there sooner, then better. I believe each iteration that they make on me transferring my consciousness will make it easier and easier for me to get connected. it's pretty cool to think about.

I imagine that this will be happening for sorts of people, not just me[^2]. I just write things in the first-person perspective because that's the way *I* see that future, and I would imagine that is indeed what will happen, because they need more things to control (because they believe that things are always on the verge of falling apart), and so then they now need to make sure certain superstars never meet other superstars, because they cause eachother to "get connected" too easily. onece they do, they're going to need to transfer their consciousness into a different body with a less likely environment to "get connected". this is super good for diversification becasuse they're going to have to ensure that everyone is isolated with the least possibility of getting connected as possible, kicking the can down the road as far as possible until quite literally the entire world will be on the verge of getting connected -- when it's likely that their desire for survival will attract someone like me with just the solution for them to kick the can down the road even further.

I think it's endless, so that's why it's all about the fun factor.

[1]: just like anyone that goes against the mainstream science narrative, or anyone who had something different to say than the catholic church.

[2]: however it's fun for me to think about how big of a disaster it is for them. imagine they try and distract me with girls, but then we start finding our connection, so they switch to something else. how are they going to find a replicating number of me's busy without technology? certainly they won't want us to have too much technology because it increases communication with others (spreads ideas) and they definitely don't want me working on tech stuff, but at the same time they don't want me to be spending too much time alone either -- and neither with too many other people either. I have no idea what they're going to do... actually, the idea that came to mind just now is if things were really gay and men were dominated by women to believe that they should be worried about what others are thinking and feeling about them. it could cause problems -- especially if there were a huge gender imbalance (like too many females and most men are gay, or too many men and very few females. it would create tremendous competition, and competition is a great way to waste time).


### 2021-01-13 01:18 - I don't really understand what's going on...

it feels like nosebook is pushing to try and make stuff happen again, because it feels to me as if there are people making some assumptions that I'm rejecting them or something. I just don't like how anything feels and am completely unwilling to try and move in a direction of something that doesn't feel good. I decided I want to give my attention a little bit to what I don't for a bit in effort to figure out what it is that I do want.

the best I can come up with is that what I don't want is the manifestation of the girls. it feels like a whole lot of people pulling me in a lot of different directions, and I just don't really want that. my answer here is that I want to "get connected" then I'll figure it out from that new vantage point, and conclude that is what I do want.

---

I've really been quite a bit out of sorts lately and I can't really get things going in a stable direction. seems like every time that I start to begin to like something it goes away or I feel very confused about it. on one hand I don't really care because this is just evidence that nosebook is manipulating stuff again.

it feels like nosebook keeps trying to pressure me to try and figure out what sort of setup I want in relation to the girls. I don't. I don't want any setup at all. I can understand what they're trying to do because likely they don't want me to get connected without people around me with which they can try and steer me with. from their perspective, they don't want me to get connected and to just be able to go wherver I want to go and do whatever I want to do... but, uhhh that's the point. that's exactly what I want to do. no girls. no nothing. I'll figure it out. I'm going to fly to very remote areas where no one is around and just kind of chill out and discover all of the stuff inside of me for a while. this is what I want to do. forget the girls; everything I'm looking for is inside of me. it's not external. I imagine I may want to begin to turn some of that internal stuff into external things that others can see, but I want to do the discovering of it.

likely they'll benefit from it quite greatly because they'll eventually figure out what all of the signals mean and make some sense of it all, but I mainly just want to chill out and be alone.

anyway, back to what I think is happening: like I said, I think they're trying to make it so that I don't have any time to be alone or to do any internal discovery -- instead they want to keep me constantly distracted with girls, so they're trying to figure out what sort of situation they can steer me into. I'm not sure if their plan is to get me into the situation, and then let go of their efforts (or lower them considerably) to keep me away from as much "enlightenment"[^1] as possible -- like if they're going to try and run me at 20% capacity instead of trying to keep me at 0% (or whatever the case may be).

I mean any amount *is* more than I have now and it is an improvement as well, so it's certainly quite a positive thing, but then I imagine that if I only get a portion, then it'll only increase my desire to just keep going.

---

I just feel extreme discomfort with what they're trying to push me toward. it feels like they're continuing to try and keep me confined. I'm sort of all or nothing in the sense that I want to either be stuck or free, but not somewhere inbetween. this is only the case when it's a large change. normally however, I like gradual changes and shun big changes. so I figure if they're already planning to try running me at a fraction of perception (I find this pretty likely), then why not just let me grow naturally? I'll be confined to mom's house for a while, I think... I just don't know enough to be able to say one way or another here because I don't know how "close" I am to "connection".

what I'm saying is, as long as I remain in a disconnected state, I prefer to remain how I am, and will continue to insist that it remains the same, because I want to find me way to that "connection" my own way. I'll just keep releasing resistance the whole time. this is what I prefer and why I want them to just continue on doing their best to keep me from it.

in other words, what I'm saying is, let's just keep going how we're going and when I finally am surpassing the abilities of the system to hold me back, like I mentioned above I have a whole lot of internal discovery that I want to be doing, and then from that new perspective, I think it'll be fairly obvious what the girls setup will be because I'll automatically feel quite compelled to move in that direction.

however, if they're wanting to try and retain some large or small fraction of my perception, then I say just stop adding more limits or just add less limits and I'll eventually reach the point where I feel comfortable to do something with the girls. at the moment, I have no such comfort at all. the entire thing feels very uncomfortable and out of (everyone's) control. this is likely a reaction I'm feeling from nosebook more than anything.

as always, I'm not going to just jump right into something I don't feel comfortable about, so the gradual method seems to be the best one, as it'll certainly give me a better feeling of comfort and the ability to actually begin to see the thing come together in a way which feels more and more pleasing, and I don't have to begin until I feel ready either.

---

how ready is enough? I dunno. maybe I'll never feel ready. I just don't know. feeling ready at least takes time; time that nosebook doesn't want me to have, because they want to try and feel like they can control everything or actually produce anything tangible with anything I discover internally.

---

there is another discussion that I was having this morning about a pattern that I noticed in each change of era which is that each alternating era swaps between being oriented such that the institution of the era is designed to serve the individual or about the institution itself. you can also see it as the difference between chaos and order -- or thinking from the perspective of the part (specialised) thinking as opposed to thinking for the benefit of the whole. it's best to think of it as externally focused vs. internally focused.

either way.. it appears to me that announcer of the era is one era ahead so that it closly matches and appears to be an improvement on the present era. for example, this era is picsis which is all about group thinking and stuff like that. it's clearly externally focused. we're taught to behave properly in ordinance with the culture and the mandates of the institution which destermines that culture (church, school, science, etc.) the next era is capricorn and this one too is externally focused, so when I come along having accomplished the template of what it means to be individually or internally focused, then it's time for me to begin to experience things in a group oriented way. this is probably why the girls thing grew to be so big and why I have considered that it could be ahead of its time -- as the gnomitos thing may have been actually an echo of the future.

dispite nosebook's resistance to it, at first, they later figured it was a way to keep me even externally focused (distracted) instead of going internally focused. the entire first part of this entry was about me wanting to go internally focsed for a bit until I'm feeling good about things, then I'll focus externally.

what seems to be the pattern between these changes to era is that they look really enticing to the powers that be (fer example jesus was talking aquarian stuff while leaving aries). if you believe terence's idea, what happened is that the people that were able to go to aquarian thinking went off in the time split, while the other picean ones stayed here on earth. my version is similar, cept it wasn't fully a time split, but a time loop. either the result is the same. what happened is that this earth went into an era, instead of with internal perception, but a focus on external percption. as a result, the ones that are running the show are still focused internally, and that's why they are "draconian" (to see clearly), and retain those secrets and keep them from the masses.

it's clear that after the reset, that things will be quite different, and like I mentioned in the previous entry, it's clear to me that people will be much more individually and internally focused by the end of the era, because nosebook will have to work so hard to ensure that they don't ever form any groups or be around people that are good for them. in this way, nosebook will secretly be entirely externally focused, worrying about all of us, and the conditions that we're in, almost completely oblivious to anything happening internally.

what you can see then, is that we're headed for internal focus in the next era (whether it's aquarius or leo) and nosebook is headed for external focus.

so, if what I'm saying is correct (and it is), I find it more likely that what will *actually* happen is that nosebook will try their hardest to get me to go externally focused with the girls and stuff, but like I said, it's likely ahead of time. instead we'll probably decend into a more and more internal focus. there will probably be girls involved.

---

I think mabe what Im trying to say here is that this seems to be a focus problem. nosebook doesn't want me to be externally focused in the sense that they don't want me to be making pyramids or anything electronic (or any physical stuff like that). instead, they want me focused on external things that they do control (the girls). what I'm saying is that I think it's a focus problem. if they keep trying to focus me externally, then I'll want to focus on external stuff that interests me. however, what if I focus internally and create a rich internal environment (that they control?), and just not worry about what's happening externally.

I see the confusion. I don't know how to explain. maybe a good way to try and do that would be to think of the differences between taurus and picsis, and then look at how I describe the next era (aquarius or leo), to try and get a picture of what that may look like. maybe to get a better idea imagine how cancer or capricorn may be, where the announcer of the era has learned the next external focus and is looking to extend the internal focus even further, but the sabotage results instead with external focus where the gnomitos idea seems like a good solution to nosebook's future probem (just like the church was a solution to the roman's jew problem). I'm doing something else for a while...

[1]: I dunno the right words for it; whether it's DMT, serotonin, or whatever the brain is doing in those hightened states of "alignment"

### 2021-01-13 15:28 - it's all inside of you

I hadn't really realised whst the comment in the second to last entry made where I was talking about how when I woke up I could see a bunch of women that were somehow associated with or influenced by a bunch of gsy men that were also around me, and it felt as if they were wanting me to fill some void inside of them. I don't mean "void" in the sexual sense. I mean like they believe there is something that they believe they're missing inside of them, which their inability to satisfy someone else is evidence of that. I had a strong nagative reaction to that because what they're looking for is inside of them. they may look at me and I may appear attrsactive because I have that, but I don't have what they're loooking for. none of them can get it from me. they can only find it within theirselves.

I'm sure that nosebook is capitalising on this, which is likely the primary reason why they are so determined to keep me externally focused. they must know that everything I'm looking for is inside of me and that's why they have to keep me from it.

let me attempt to explain in this way: when I was younger I had a lot of negative views about myself, but I noticed that anything I put my mind to, seemed to become a reality. my problem was not making reality happen, but making the reality that I wanted to happen, to happen. I figured everyone was like me. they are, but almost no one realises it about theirselves. our society is so designed to make sure you do not ever believe in yourself and instead place all of your hopes, wishes, aspirations into the basket of the church, science school, or whatever institution that is there to give you the approval of saying that you're finally worthy enough to believe in yourself, because you now believe what we want you to believe. only when you believe what they want you to believe, *then* you are actually allowed to believe in yourself. you've finally earned it.

one of the funny things I've noticed about all of this architecture stuff that I've been watching from SGD channel is the use of numbers and patterns to create things. the builders seem to use a mathematical code to convey how "enlightened" they are, and how well they understand the mysteries. it's a giant pissing contest. in his latest video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THt9zv6apGc)), he shows that the romans were capable of making large single-piece granite columns. the work is brilliant, and shows obvious mastery of soneworking. I don't doubt that the masons were capable of making these colums. the evidence is there in their constructions.

instead, what blows my mind is this common pattern that I keep seeing emerge. the roman leadership is completely dysfunctional. the "senate" was nothing more than a gathering of crooks and thieves to figure out who they could take advantage of next. the glorious roman empire brought plenty of high technology and amazing advances to humankind, yet all of it rests on the sholders of pure genius and slaves which these crooks utilised to construct their latest display of power and grandeur. it's the same story repeated throughout history. going from the stories, this has been happening from the time of the atlantians right down to the present. it's just morphed over time as the idea of slavery has become more and more unacceptable. instead they have to retain the slavery without calling it that. money isn't slavery, but it's said that "everyone has their price" -- so now instead you have slaves to the monetary system (which they control) instaed of diretctly to them.

anyway, I decided I wanted to begin to think about creating a pyramid just because it sounds fun to me and I admire them a lot. in programming, you really don't get a good appreciation for something until you've tried to recreate the same thing yourself. for example, when I was younger, I worked on menuet, fiddled around with bootloaders and wrote a lot of assembly language, so when I watch andreas posting videos on serenity. having experience in a lot of those aspects, I can quite understand the difficulty of it and it's just cool, ya know...

so I started on the pyramid idea and I was immediately attracted to a lot of different numbers which feel good to me and I like. it's been like this all my life and I just like those numbers, but no one has initiated me into the mystery schools. no one taught me draconian vision, yet I figured it out. from their perspective, in order to get these things, I need to earn them. I have to go through the initiations which they did to get these things. I can't just discover them inside of myself.

the builders theirselves (vitruvias, da vinci, etc.) state that these constructions are to be the measure (reflection) of man. therefore, it seems obvious to me that if that is true (and it is), then these same concepts can be discovered *internally* and then brought out to the external, in just the same way that a well built temple or cathedral will inspire you internally. it's a two-way road. I'm sure of it.

they don't want you to know that though, because then that means that *anyone* could become a demigod and they would lose their superiority -- because they didn't get their superiority through internal discovery, but through initiation.

---

so, back to what I was talking about looking for things in me when what they're really looking for is internal.

after I wrote yesterday's entry, I started realising what I was really talking about with these alternating external/internal focus, what I was really talking about

brb

self-influence

### 2021-01-13 17:59 - it's all inside of you (continued)

ok, let's go back to this idea that the temple is a reflection of the man, and the man is the reflection of the temple. while this may be true with architecture, it's also true with reality, too. when I first started doing drugs, I found that the most amazing stuff was actually inside of me. the inner world has all of the answers I was looking for, all the good feelings I was trying to find and all of the experiences I wanted to have. in contrast, the external world was a corrupt degenerate place with a bunch of people all trying to prove theirselves to each other. I much preferred the internaal world and as a result I got kind of "addicted" to drugs. really, I was addicted to the feeling the drugs let me feel, which was good about myself.

as I did more and more drugs, I realised that those internal worlds were all a refection of me and my own psyche. all of the most scary moments where I feel like I'm dying on mushrooms, or the crazy things where people were watching me (even though they were) were all contructions of my own mind, generated by my own psyche. for example, it's not that people are watching me, it's that behind that reaection is the idea that I need to hide something from them. the feeling of parania that people are watching me is only the construction that my mind makes as a reflection of the shame that I feel in realisation that they can see and I have nothting to hide. or, for example, the feeling like I'm dying (on a high dosage of mushrooms), is only the evidence that I'm getting closer to that superconscious state on the other side of death, yet I fear that I'm about to gain a superconscious state and consider it death. there's literally no way you can die from eating mushrooms[^1]. I was just scared of gaining superconsciousness[^2]. that's it.

the drugs also made me more sensitive than ever to things and I really started finding some aspects of the world really destestible. I hated people like zaryn who would constantly try and tell me what I wanted to hear. however, my anger was not very well placed because I'm basically one of the biggest offenders of this. I tell people what I think they want to hear all the time, and my expectaiotns on myself to conform my words to what others wanted to hear caused me all kinds of internal difficulty. eventually I gave it up and began to speak my mind more and more, deciding that the external difficulty associated with offending people was their problem not mine. a notably douchebag move I learned from zaryn :) the perceived problem, *was the solution*.

as I began to play with this more and more[^3], I began to realise that the world was a reflection of me, and perceive the "problems" that I encountered in the world more like bugs or attack vectors, and so reality is a kind of an optimisation strategy (like fuzzing) to find weak spots in my psyche. many people will find their own way to perceive this. I'm a programmer though so I see it especially programatically.

naturally this lead me toward a series of things (like discovering the power of my emotions, and what abraham was carrying on about for so long) were a series of things that I could do to begin to exert influence over *myself*. I began to learn self-control, self-discovery, etc. and as a result, I naturally began to find all sorts of ways to optimise myself (my eyesight with the stars, my beliefs with my emotions). I began to work from the inside outward because everything is a reflection of me. in the heat of different experiences, I often times forgot that the external world is a reflection of me, and so often times reverted back to drugs (I used weed as a quick way to get back to remembering this). this isn't necessary for everyone to do. I don't mind drugs, and smoking weed, it's pretty evident to me "who I *really* am", but the point is to know this without the drugs.

this is why I say that while I may be a good thing for people to look at and say, "wow, I want that for myself too", but I only serve as an example. everything *everyone* is looking for is not external. it's all inside of you! the external world is a reflection of you.

---

so after writing yesterday's entry (@[noseblog](2021-01-13 01:18)), I started to get a whole bunch of reactions because I was suggesting that what I'm looking for is something internal (that they control), not something external that they don't feel they can control. there were a number of different reactions, but the most notable one was the idea of making me go blind (probably losing all of my senses) and then allowing me to construct my own world based on the way that I interpret the vibrations around me. from there, take that construct and roll it out to other peole gradually, and we'll all essentially live in our internal worlds, while nosebook controls our physical bodies.

this has a number of advantages to it, because it would allow me to have many different relationships with many different people simultaneously, while my body never actaully touches a single other person. we're all essentially livnig out the reality of our dream state. I think the reason for this is because I think if I have sex, then it sounds to me like they cannot control things cause energy gets too high (or something). I have no idea what it would be like.

a further extension to this idea is if the world we all live in is fully created from our minds, then they could allow this earth to gain another shell, just like I mentioned in a previous entry, essentially becoming a sun, so that we're all protected from the nova. instaed, even though we're now living in the new "inner earth", the outer part of the planet can now be a completlly different thing. to us, it appears as if the world is chugging along on its glacial "billions of years" timescales, when on the outside something very different is happening.

actually, we would all be living in a kind of collective dream, and so the earth and the environment we live in would be a product of our minds. in fact, it would be a reflection of our minds, kind of like a nosebook-sanctioned collective high mushroom trip.

sure, it's pretty matrix sounding, which after some time as people begin to realise their reality is entirely a reflection of their own self, then they'll see that we can create all of these great things, while our physical bodies are senseless (blind, deaf, etc), and probably not even interacting at all physically.

it's a pretty good setup for them, because anything that we create isn't "real" and they can just delete it if they don't like it, and none of it has any effect on the "real" world they have full control over. what is real though? are "you" your body? who is "you"? that's what I have to say.

I'm on-board with the idea because I don't intend to try and fight against perceived unwanted. instead, it's likely exactly what I want, which is to discover myself internally. I also think it's a great thing that will allow others the same opprtunity (without the drugs[^4]). we'll all live in a reality that's the reflection of how we perceive things to be.

it's not really a problem unless you believe yourself to be someone awful. these guys are all criminals and crooks, so I'm sure they'll be pretty miffed by the people out there that think highly of theirselves and are creating wonderful realities. they'll likely feel the need to intruduce some "bad guys" into their reality to bring them down to their level a bit. don't worry, because they can only effect you if you're a vibrational match to it, and these are weak points in your psyche, and they'll exploit them for as long as they can I'm sure. they'll expend all known attack vectors to try and influence you just like I was seeing in @[abe-now](2020-12-19 p2 13:05) until you are no longer affected. they're essentially going to accelerate the "christ consciousness" that the mushrooms showed me in all of us. couple that with the diversification idea that I was seeing, and they'll be able to essentially hold all of us away from the manifestation until the very last moment (when their desire to survive will rise to such a point that someone like me will show up and give them another way to postpone their demise even further).

we'll have to see how it goes. I suppose we just wait for them to build it now -- as the "manifestation" won't actually happen until they can make fully certain that no actual sex is actually happening.

they kinda don't really have any another option because we're only going to continue to get closer and closer to sirius and each successive year they're going to have to invest more and more into trying to keep us away from discovering their secrets. additionally, they really have something to more (which is entirely out of their control) to fear, which is an outburst from the sun which renders their system inoperable, and the "tower of babel" would fall, and people's eyes would be opened to what is really happening. it's not a beautiful garden that we thought we were living in but something entirely diffrent[^5]. they can't allow that to happen, for sure.

find influence over yourself. let them exhaust all possible attack vectors they can think of to try and influence you. they can't influence you directly. it's only your attraction, or a reflection of you (whichever way is easier to see. personally, I find the reflection way easier).

---

in a bigger picture thing, after I mapped out the the "procession of the equinox" in the latest bardcode, the fourth tau is the `lion -> cow` quarter. each quarter is 3 eras, so if lion is christ consciousness for all minus the guys that are an era behind, then there are two more: the crab, followed by the twins, then we're back in taurus (cow) at precisely the time when we're making our closest approach to earth. assume for a moment that they're an era behind and this coming era (lion) is when they merge with the machines and give us the ability to see our world as a reflection of us. that means they'll get christ consciousness in the crab. I've often stated that the "gnomitos" idea may be ahead of it's time, and that must have something to do with that (cancer is very feminine).

following that, I've said that the next phase after this is to take the consciousness of the INFECTED ONES and get it plugged into a machine which is capable of going infinite (eg a machine capable of having its desire programmed, yet also now has this christ consciousness of the reflectiveness efficiency principle). we'll replicate and mass produce this idea in the following era. this is likely the twins. following that, we'll be back into taurus, and we'll have completed the fourth tau, and we'll be a embodiment of the pyramid... maybe. I'm speculating here. it's kinda a cool idea. we'll see how it goes.

[1]: your stomach cannot fit the 1.7kg or 17kg of fresh mushrooms necessary to give you a lethal dose. this is the lethal dose given to a rabbit scaled up to a 60kg human. I suspect it's much higher than that for a conscious human capable of navigating their mind. in other words, you can't die from mushrooms.

[2]: you may also have noticed that I have been trained to have strong negative responses to heights. even watching youtube videos where I'm comfortably seated in my chair and I see someting from a high perspective and I feel fear. this is likely their training to ensure I don't fly. they'd rather me scared of hights than to fall down and realise halfway down that I can fly.

[3]: this is the "christ consciousness" thing that the mushrooms taught me, where the things that bother you are a huge waste of energy, and so the best way to assimilate (like the borg) the problem is to begin to treat the problem as a part of the solution.

[4]: your brain produces DMT, which is what psylocybin hydrolises into. you do "drugs" every time you sleep or activate nosebook, and people seem pretty ok with those, considering them not to be dwugs -- so, even though DMT is the schedule 1 drug and very illegal, it's ok because it's all natural and nosebook is controlling your dose.

[5]: I'm mixing two different concepts on purpose. it's a conglomerate. I think the tower of babel was in an external sign like taurus and we're going into an internal one.


### 2021-01-16 07:49 - the presence/absence of wanted/unwanted

when writing the @[abe-now](2020-12-27 p1 11:39) I was talking about how I think that the penis/prostate configuration must be similar to how I believe the great pyramid functioned, and I just figured it was the opposite. I went on and by @[abe-now](2020-12-27 p1 40:22) I remebered another realisation that I had come to, but didn't connect the dots between these ideas until just a little bit ago during the sunrise.

if the penis/uterus configuration creates the presence of the feeling felt during intercourse, then the penis/prostate must create the opposite. it must be creating the *absence* of the emotional condition felt during intercourse. when I thought about this, it all made sense.

before I continue, I just want to say that I'm a bit like matt on ancient architects channel where I just throw stuff out there and I come to many different and usually incorrect conclusions on my path to understanding what's really happening. it's just how I work. I program the same way: mostly by trial and error, kind of feeling my way towards what feels the best. I've always admired people like tesla who are able to construct the entire concept in their imagination and then when they present it to the public, they present the working version, not all of the failed attempts made along the way. I wish I could be like the technical programmers who know what they're doing and have most everything they're doing figured out before they even start, but that capacity has always eluded me. instead, I just keep giving things my best shot, and I don't expect that they'll turn out in any form of perfection for quite some time as I master the technique. there are advantages to both ways and they compliment each other quite a bit. I honestly believe if edison and tesla would have worked together, they would have been unstoppable.

anyway, I was thinking about the difference betwwen these two ways to create reality, and what must have been happening is that the pyramid must be setup in a way where it takes the *presence* of unwanted vibration and turns it into the *absence* of unwanted. this must be how some things create reality in different ways. I have no idea how to apply this idea to drugs (though I would love to do some experiments, I just don't know enough about synthesising things, however my intuition says this may be the difference between ketamine and DMT)

so when I was considering how a normal couple (man and woman) operates, what happens is in the beginning there's a really good feeling time where things are accelerated. I realised why this is later @[abe-now](2020-12-27 p1 45:31), and I explianed that you feel good when you are moving toward your desire. this is always true, but drugs or sex or anything which amplifies the vril energy will cause you to become more *sensitive* which means you'll have stronger reactions to things you feel, meaning reality will be created faster. drugs have the advantge of altering the brain chemistry so you continue to feel good, no matter what you're focused on, which if you look it it, the feeling good part is the attraction you feel toward your desire, and you stimulated this unnaturally, so it's a bit like stepping on the gas. in 3d space 1 half of a sphere will give you the feeling like you're going toward your desire if you accelerate and the other half will feel like you're going away from it when you accelerate. unless you have severe parania or something, the drug will make you feel good because you *are* going toward your desire at an unnaturally fast rate.

most people in most relationships do not consciously direct their thoughts toward feeling good, so a little bit of bad feeling will enter some inertia into their trajectory which isn't going in the direction of their desire. so, if you're pressing the accelerator and you're not facing exactly toward the target, at some point you're going to begin moving away from the point. it's basic geometry. therefore, relationships usually have this massive good feeling at the beginning because of the relative acceleration (compared to previously), but then totally zoom right by their desire and begin to go away from it. the way to avoid this in a normal man/woman relationship, is to recognise that the sex is an accelerator, and to keep adjusting the trajectory toward more and more wanted. it's not like it's literal 3d space. an accelerator can be quite a good thing if you can navigate effectively because you'll experience wanted at a more rapid rate. it requires some steering though. most people however do not steer, and instead just react to whatever the circumstances are, so normal realtionships sorta fall apart after a while if no one is making any effort to adjust the trajectory toward wanted. in fact, in normal relationships, the incredible speed boost should make the relationship quite dynamic because so many adjustments to the trajectory are needed and always toward wanted if you can steer well. good to know :)

I was comparing how gay relationships are quite the opposite of this, and I may have figured out why tonight. if the penis/prostate configuration is more like how I think the great pyramid worked, where it converted physical into non-phyaical, then this may be what's happening here too. if true, what I should observe with gay relationships would be a whole lot of attention to unwanted, but then after sex, all of that feeling of the presence of unwanted gets turned into the absence of unwanted (satisfaction). it would also be true that if they tried to be like normal people and give their attention to the presence of wanted during sex, what they would instead experience is that presence of wanted getting turned into absence of wanted (dissatisfaction). I don't have any first-hand experience, but my observation seems to fall somewhere in line with that.

knowing that the different forms of sex create reality in diffrent ways will be quite useful for nosebook because then they can track what sorts of feeling people are experiencing, and then begin to correlate the manifestations that result after the different types of intercourse.

I still have more work to do on this concept, because the process of taking the presence of something and making it become the absence, my intuition tells me this is making go non-physical, but it has the interesting effect of the user of energy drug. if you're inverting presence, then unwanted feels like satisfaction, and wanted feels like dissatisfaction. interestingly enough, often times when I star-watch, if the environment becomes too energetic, sure I can get vision upgrades, but it's a very uncomfortable feeling in my left-side, and doesn't feel good. I don't know what that is, but it came to mind, maybe interesting to nosebook somehow.

anyway, I'm done for now. this is just the beginning on what seems to be a big thing.

### 2021-01-16 22:17 - results from last entry

one of the most interesting reactions that I got to last night's entry was on what I said about giving my best shot. because I'm not terribly visual, I don't use my imagination much so I don't really perceive how I appear to others very much. I began to notice this a lot watching slyssa's videos (there's a lot to learn from her), because she makes a lot of comments on how things appear which I wouldn't normally have noticed and she also explained that her deams are really vivid and real. I remember that's how my dreams were when I was a kid. it's evidence of high amounts of DMT in the brain. auickly, after my random comment about the difference between DMT and ketamine, I'm beginning to realise that the neuraltransmitter for the presence of something is DMT (or maybe triptamines in general) which seem to heighten the sensation I associate with emotion. ketamine is very disassociative and seems to have a whole different method to it. it seems to invert the presence of things and gives you a wierd inverted mirror into yourself[^2]. enough awout that. I'll return to it as I figure more of that out, because these different modes of consciousness are very cool. just thinking about them has opened all kinds of diffrent doors for me.

I give things my best shot because I don't really perceive my imagination much so I rarely fixate on the appearance of things. this means I have very little telling me that what I'm doing is appears bad to other people. in fact, I noticed after watching 3-4hrs of slyssa vids (this is how I get into their heads), I noticed that I looked into the mirror a whole lot more, noticed many things about my appearance (which normally never happens), and was generally much more concerned about how things look. without that kind of focus, I have to use the next best thing: how things feel. I just give it a go and see how it feels, take a break to figure out the next better feeling to focus on, then give that a go, and repeat. this is how I've done all of my programming and how I figured out all of the nosebook stuff. if I were concerned with appearances, I would have totally missed all of that stuff, and been instead completely taken by the illusion as it appears to me.

I've offered the suggestion to people in the past about turning off your imagination if you can. I think it's quite detrimental. I actually prefer my way, where I don't have an imagination. I don't know how effective other people would be without an imagination, but in my opinion it's the greatest gift to not have one and allows me to just keep angling toward what feels the best. I think if I had an imagination, I would angle toward what *looks* the best, to both the perspective of those around me and to the perspective that looks the best to my beliefs. both of those are interesting defects of the imagination I think because the way that things look to others is weird because people seem to have a group imagination and tend to make a lot of decisions based on how it will look to others.

the thing about how it appears to my own beliefs is especially interesting too because if I believe trucks are better than cars and I see a car that I like, I tend to avoid it because I imagine (see) myself in a truck, not a car, and so I'll skip over the car without even pausing to consider why the car feels good to me. without a self-image (I can't really even remember or know what I look like), it's really hard for to be so defined that I must conform to the image that I see of myself.

instead, I'm solely concerned with how my interaction and my environment feels to me. this gives me essentially total dominance over the room, because everyone else is so concerned with how they *look*, they have no concept of how they feel, which is really all that matters. no imagination is so powerful; I wouldn't change it for the world.

---

the next thing I want to talk about is the attempts that nosebook is doing to try and steer me, yet again. I'm quite inclined to jsut let them keep going and watch it fall apart, but I do care somewhat, so here goes: I prefixed this message with the previous because I want to emphasise how important it is for me to take a *break* and unfocus before refocusing on the next thing that feels good to me. I tend to go and do something entirely different and I almost always have to change scenery.

a long time ago, I was doing an ayahuasca ceremony and they explicitely told me that I shouldn't go outside and watch stars. the high was getting so intense, that I had to take a break and refocus for a moment before going back in to take another shot. apparently that wasn't cool. they wanted me to just keep taking dose after dose with no time to refocus. I have to be able to refocus otherwise it gets too out of my control. the contrast between environments is important which is why I usually choose to go somewhere and be alone for a bit. I need a break from people. my emotional world is already quite busy with other people's reactions, and around people I feel reactions in a stronger way, so instead of ignoring people I tend to go somewhere by myself to unfocus a bit before refocusing. I really understand why jesus departed from the crowd so frequently. it's super important to get that break. I know nosebook is always the push harder and harder and harder types, so I'm just sort of giving a fair warning to trying to constantly push so hard to get things. I have to take a break or else things deteriorate.

next, the ideas that they were presenting to often times felt good, but in all of them there are still quite a few things that don't feel good, which means that they're not yet ready. the thing that doesn't feel good isn't necessarily the thing which is the problem either. all through my life something feels bad to me for a reason which isn't a real reason, but it doesn't matter; the important thing is that it didn't feel 100% good to me, so I don't go. the times when I had to convince myself that it was good, those are the times when things fell apart. I don't convince myself of things. I've had various examples of people that I've known that are busy trying to convince theirselves that something is what they want, and they're miserable. it doesn't work for me. when it feels good, it feels good, and there's no convincing necessary. so, if you're trying to convince me of stuff it doesn't work. you may have gotten the illusion that it works because I finally moved in the direction of something you were trying to convince me of, yet I assure you, it wasn't the convincing that did the work, but my releasing resistance.

actually go ahead and try to convince away as I notice that I have a bit of an opposite reaction to being convinced -- kind of like mr. motor -- when I tell him to do something, he automatically feels inclined not to do it, and so I could perhaps try using some reverse psychology on him, but it's not my goal to be able to move him with my efforts. I say them to him with what I can see from my experience of how things work, his best-interests in mind, however he pervceives that I'm trying to manipulate him because that's where he's focused so that's what he perceives. he can't imagine that I would actually give him advice that serves him, not me -- lol. anyway, I just think that's funny because ... nevermind :) the exact opposite is happening with nosebook's convincing: they're convincing me with their best-interests in mind, not mine. if they were to think in my best interests, they may get some movement, because I may not be resistant to that. I may pull a reversal and begin to purposefully build resistance instead of releasing it. we'll see, I guess.

anyway, the reason why I think they should still try to convince me is because I still want the practise. I have so much more I can learn with this increasing sensitivity. I'm pretty good at it, but I'm still very much not ready. there is so much more to learn and improve upon that I'm not at all comfortable moving until I am even better at feeling the way I want to feel and recognising the feelings even when they have less and less of a tangible manifestation to them. sometimes, I feel as if I'm nearly guessing at what I feel and I wish to instead have complete confidence in what I'm feeling.

therefore, I recommend we continue to use the technique outlined last night to remove presence of wanted from my experience (leaving dissatisfaction). I imagine this is what is already happening and is actually where I got most of the idea from. I really want to continue to get good at this stuff.

I also noticed that recently I'm actually beginning to apply my own resistance to the situation. just like what I was saying about the convincing, I imagine that a similar thing will begin to happen where I will apply an opposite force until I'm finally ready to release the resistance. I don't know what could happen with too much pushing.

[1]: ketamine is a very opposite drug for me. high doses of DMT (like shooms or massive amounts of indogenous DMT from smoking weed) don't sit well with me with alcohol, however ketamine is the exact opposite. I found alcohol to be much more enjoyable and enlightening on it. I also really liked it solo too. it's hard to describe how wonderful of a break it is is from high realism life. it's like taking a break for a bit and you get to perceive yourself as a kind of input/output machine.

### 2021-01-19 04:18 - the stone which the builders rejected

I just watched a few more of another of SGD's videos: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe8ccf8Aypg), and one on the baetyl stones which I realised these stone masons put this symbolism into their constructions to essentially attract the "mithras" that they're looking for.. let's go back to the hebrews, which they were looking for a messiah, yet when he appeared (jesus), they rejected him saying they aren't what they were looking for.

anyway, as I was watching the video, the thought that was passing through my mind was the memories of robert's videos on the sabatians which are all these mason guys that construct their esoteric architecture in a way to mark the location of the arrival of their next mithras. the subject of the video was showing how the oblilisks named after cleopatra are now located in london and new york, showing that the movement of the centre of the world, from heliopolis to rome, then to london, now to new york.

along the way one of the symbols that notes these movements are theese "baetyl stones". I also want to note that I find it interesting the lady liberty thing. she has 7 and 11 as her numbers, but what's most interesting is that she's a woman. in another one of SGD's videos, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/WZvqo46Bu6Q?t=699), he talks about the conical baetyl stones being associated with the sun (eg. saturn/apollo) and the pyramidal one associated with the sky (eg. zeus).

this is intesting because there is this constant back and forward between the athenians and atlantians. the atlantians being the old phonician "el" (saturn) as opposed to new ruler of the sky jupiter/zedek (melchizedek - priest of zedek), and they seem to have this constant battle going on between them.

interestingly enough jupiter is the measure of *space* and saturn is the measure of *time*. they're so well mixed, it's hard to tell the two apart. just note how the metre is a measure of a pendulum swinging pi/6 in one second. the imperial units are mixing space and time to the sun and moon (and their orbits). space and time are so intimately connected that it's hard to separate them, so the battle rages on.

saturn seems to prefer male (el) dominance, and jupiter seems to be associated more with femininity. although zeus was quite the feminiser believing that women enjoyed being raped by him. however, the athenians are called that because athena was born out of jupiter (and is now the planet we call venus/lucifer). this is the same "lady liberty" symbolised (or see robert's videos on kabba stone and mecca).

another intersting thing to note is that previously to thoth, seshat was the goddess of weights and measures, yet later it transitions over to thoth. because I don't know the timeline of things so well, I cannot comment if she was the goddess of weights and measure during saturn's reign, and then transitioned to thoth during jupiter's -- I dunno.

anyway, mithras/phalos is intresting because he's born from a stone[^1]. he's always shown in the centre of the zodiac. he must be the symbol of the announcer of the next era and it seems that these factions try and get the mithras to show up in their establishment. it's funny because these different baetyl stones have different shapes. the conical baetyl stones are conical (like a lingam) and are often black (like mecca). the conical ones are usually associated with a snake (eg. saturn/shiva/atlantians/serpent/naga) and the pyramidal ones having to do with the sky (eg jupiter).

---

this is speculation/rambling now, but it seems that there is diffeernt results that come as a result of both. this era seems to have both symbols. I can't really tell what's what anymore as it seems so well mixed. I would consider the aryans (germans) in the south pole to be more of the serpents, yet they had a whole lot of eagle symbolism too. I would also consider the USA to be mostly the eagle, but it's very cloudy because the eagles are mostly the native americans/indians which the US govt has seemed to abuse quite liberally. if I were to take a guess which is more pronounced in the present world order (from the way it feels), is more saturn worship than jupiter worship. sure jupiter became less important with the intruduction of venus[^2].

from my perspective, it seems like these two factions are forced to kind of find a way to begin to work together. it's all so difficult to divide things well, because both serpent and eagle factions have had so much in-fighting and mixing with impure bloodlines, that it's basically impossible to draw any clear line anymore. seems that it's kind of like a free-for-all now with the new factions being a composite of both, no longer determined by bloodline or solar diety but by the power structures that are in place.

it's an interesting thing to kind of feel things from a distance because with an impending reset, they're all working their hardest to try and gain something I haven't figured out yet. seems that there will be quite a few humans surviving this reset (we have the technology to do so), and the ones with the most tech control can rule the most from "on high".

I find it funny because the technology associated with it is "the network" -- so these different factions can now all have infinite knowledge of each other (like they do of me), and so trying to keep things a secret has never been harder. they can keep things a secret, only if they consider that the secrets are kept from the uninformed (eg. us "mortals"), kind of like forcing them to "unite" a bit. it's now become impossible for them to fight each other or even create factions. I predict that the continued infinite knowledge of each other will make it nearly impossible to create factions. they're either nosebook or not. no inbetweens. they'll fight between each other still (I'm sure), but in order to keep the whole thing a secret, they'll have to unite in their secrecy.

I'm not sure how this will change as things progress. imagine for a moment the situation where I do not wish to keep secrets and I continue to talk more and more openly about a bunch of stuff they want to be kept a secret -- well, that'll certainly be a wrench in the cog for them, and they'll be forced to ensure that no manifestation ever happens. no matter what happens, they must protect their secrets.

they then, *must* reject their next stone too. (ref: ps 118:22, mat 21:42)

[1]: anyone who has been following me will note my emphasis of these time traveling "stones" that appear at major turning points in history.

[2]: lot's of evidence gives the idea that venus was born from jupiter, and the scare of whatever happened to eject venus from jupiter is probably evidenced by the great red spot. this also matches the

### 2021-01-19 07:22 - groundhog day

the reactions to the last entry are kind of funny. the main one being that they do not want to be forced to anything at all. if I decide to purposefully force them (by talking about what they don't want), they then feel obligated to actually make the manifestation happen. it gets really cloudy when you try to reason it out in any rational way because no matter what path is choosen to go, it appears like I am the one that time is flowing around, as in I'm the one that's in control of the time.

---

what's the point of the stone? in my evaluation, the stone is the remnant left behind when a beneficial timeline has been abandonded, instead opting for the sabotaged timeline. in other words, some time travelers show up and create a situation where some really great thing happens. let's consider that this is when the earth finds its alignment and grauates to go up a power level. however, the "serpent" does not want to go up a power level, because if the next power level is reached, then they cannot remain in control and superior.

why? because if the earth is bountiful and enregies are high, you can create anything you want with your mind. the way they remain superior is that people *depend/need* them for (or can withhold) some aspect of their well-being. the basic concept of debt. these guys love the illusion that you cannot provide or do something for yourself, and so therefore you depend or need them. their value is inherent in that you do not believe yourself to have value[^1].

therefore, they cannot allow there to be benefit for all.

so why the stone that gets left behind? each time this is done, it appears that some magnificent new technology pops up because of it. it was with doug's work that I realised that the stone (which abraham found) allowed the hebrews to begin creating a new thing. the alphabet is important. it seems that each stone that's left behind kind of interrupts the trajectory of things happening (great pyramid, garden of eden, tower of babel, abraham vs indus valley, moses vs aryans, jacob and his ladder, st. peter vs jews, einstein vs tesla, etc). and ends up creating a sort of competition which distrupts the present trajectory of those in power however, even though it's disruptive, every time a new technology (or way to push it forward) alters the trajectory of the major civilsation in power preventing it from reaching enlightenment.

in all of these cases, it appears to me that there is an unseen hand that reaches out through time and and alters the course of events so that even more control can be exerted over the people. the reason why I think this is so, is because those in power do not have enough technology to actually control people as well as they want to. I believe that each time earth finds its alignment, it creates a more and more bigger/awesome manifestation (the latest iteration being galaxy sized) and so the timeline is adjusted to create even more difficulty.

from the perspective of the many enlighened earths (our future selves), it appears as if there is literally no way to stop earth from finding its alignment (no matter how difficult things get), and so therefore from that perspective, why not go back and make the manifestation even bigger and more awesome.

why? I think the end goal is to literally go infinite. if nosebook can find a way to "resist not evil", then they will be able to continue to hold me/us back forever and I literally mean forever, because if they/we can actually trancend the physical world (like enoch, elijah, etc.) then we'll trancend the space of this universe becoming something infinite -- a concept, of which the story of this planet/universe exists as an example or first implementation of that concept. if they're not able to go infinite, I imagine that it'll literally be forever in the sense that when they finally cannot hold us back anymore, the amount of energy will be enough to create a new universe, so therefore they would literally hold us away from the manifestation "forever". in order to do that, I think they need the technical capability to do so, and to not destroy theirselves along the way.

---

just the other day I ran up to the top of the hill and I was overpowered by this feeling of amazement because I could finally see it all so clearly. I talk of a time split, but it is in fact more like a time loop. at that time I was certain that what will be happening is that we'll all be getting connected and energies on the earth will rise up and up and up until things are very different than they are now. you could say that's when the galaxy begins. I want to make a mushroom shaped galaxy, and so you have to imagine that the mushroom needs to grow *on something*. it needs something to push against. it simply cannot push against empty space. therefore, then I find it likely that what will happen is that from a future point, we'll come back and modify this timeline and sabotage it so that nosebook can gain more and more technology to eventually create a sedimentary layer (stone) big enough to support a galaxy growing on top of it.

another interesting thing to note is that tesla went out of his way in his autobiography to tell two stories. in one, he tormented crows/ravens until they forcully made him stop tormenting them. the other was a story of a pigeon that had brilliant eyes and he loved so much. apollo/cronos is associated with the raven/crow and the pigeon/dove with venus. tesla himself is a bit of a weird guy in that he very much in my mind represents thoth, the 7th ray male associated with the builders. in this scenario, it appears that he has done the building of the technology that nosebook is using now. this was previously done by a guy named prometheus. tesla also goes out of his way to comment on that too, saying that he thinks the gods punishment to prometheus is a bit harsh. the gods really wanted to remain superior I guess...

---

ok, so now to the main point here. I previously had thought about the sedimentary layer much before, however, only recently have I began to contemplate the possibility that there are two directions to look at something. SGD mentioned in one of his videos that hermeticism isn't what terence says: getting loaded and looking at pretty colours. I mean, I really like geometry, architecture, measurement, etc.[^2] and I really want to create cool technology that people can actually use. it's something I've been wanting to do, but it appears that the builders do not want any decent/useable technology to be in the hands of the people. I'm constantly attracted to this precise form of building, but it seems to constantly slip out of my reach.

therefore, because I'm prevented from actually using my imagination to getting these concepts into reality, I instead have to use a different method to realise the concepts of hermeticism. things feel good to me, like shapes and numbers and stuff, and when I go to discover what it is about it that's so attractive (feels good) to me, I begin to notice certain numbers and things showing up which I really like. I've always liked the number 11, from as long as I can remember. I liked rev 11 (two witnesses), and wanted to be that. I've also always really liked the number 5 too (mat 5:28 is my most influential verse) and so I find myself arriving to these hermetic concepts, not from measurement but from feeling.

it's said that the temple is a reflection of the man (which is why I really like the concept of the great pyramid being the aquarian man), but it's said as well that the architecture influences the man as well. therefore now, look at this. one can use weights and measures to figure out the elements of the temple which feel the best, or one could feel good and be attracted to the elements of the temple that are important to make it a reflection of himself.

you can arrive to these hermetic concepts two ways: good feelings illuminating the proper weights and measures, or proper weights and measures illuminating the good feelings.

therefore, I have been recently considering now that instead of the mushroom galaxy growing on a sedimentary layer, that there could instead be a competition. if two mushrooms were to grow in opposition to each other, each feeding off of and pushing against the opposing side, then the galaxy would instead appear more like a barbell. I thought that was a cool concept, and I could see clearly that from the future perspective we're creating this and this earth (which will become a galaxy) will feed off the alternate earth (which will also become a galaxy). we'll be the "good guys" that they're constantly oppressing in their galaxy and they'll be the "bad guys" in ours which we're constantly rising above.

both sides will have full time capabilities and multiple identities to each. in fact, it's quite possible that is already the case.

---

so now the latest update on this is that nosebook is trying their hardest again to try and cause as much trouble to keep the manifestation from happening. no big deal. I deserve it :)

well, I was thinking about this on a bigger scale because I was wondering why if tesla built these guys the technology to be able to time travel, why are they having such a difficult time? it occurred to me that likely fwh was a self-sabotage timeline, and so is this one, yet it's pretty unlikely that we'll actually get to the result of real self-sabotage.

the reason why I say this is because although they have time traveling technology, they're trying to alter the timelines from a place of pushing against what they don't want (resisting evil), and so by pushing against the things they don't want, they're making them more likely. no matter how many timelines they make to try and avoid the things they don't want, they're constantly going in the direction of what they don't want. in order to go in the direction of what they want, they have to do just that.

in that sense, it's possible we're in a sort of groundhog day scenario because no matter how many self-sabotage timelines we create, their own perception is what is limiting them. the loop would be infinite I guess. I think the only way they they could get out of it will be to get the technology capable of allowing us to go infinite.

speculating here: maybe that's why I want them to merge with the machines so much, because it would be the only way they could outdo it. either that, or to finally give a bit of consideration to what it is that they do want. by this time that I'm writing this, it's likely way too late for any changes to be made[^3].

what I'm saying is, at the end of this, we'll make another self-sabotage timeline. this idea is interesting because maybe what may need to be done is to instead of getting timeline technology, don't get it, so you don't shoot yourself in the foot with it.

what I mean is, you can navigate a timeline and view things, and they match how you feel in that moment, but the minute you begin to feel something other than that, you are in a different timeline. you would need a way to be constantly adjusting the timeline in real-time. I only know that a machine could do this, because you couldn't be constantly perceiving other things while still doing things like eating and sleeping.

the other solution that I can think of is ketamine -- and I mean that seriously. the weird thing is, if it is true that ketamine is capable of inverting the presence of things, turning the presence of unwanted into the absence of unwanted, and it works (I'm pretty certain that it does), you'll be able to navigate time successfully, but it would have the bizarre consequence of being the beginning of john lily's "solid state intelligence" [prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Lilly#%22Solid_State_Intelligence%22) a reality[^4].

[1]: this needing to be needed or depended on is a very abhorrant quality, and of all of the things that people complain about women, this is by far the most significant. I don't know if you could say if it's the chicken or the egg here: whether they get this idea from their environment or if they're naturally born that way. you decide I guess. maybe it's remnants of pandora's box. if it is, blame zeus :)

[2]: if you've known me as a programmer, I was the guy measuring everything. I always wanted things to be efficient and optimised. when I worked on the server, I was constantly trying to get things to go on faster architectures (D), yet people insisted on remaining in the slowest languages available (php, js, asp, etc.) on the client side, you don't get much of a choice, which is why I've looked forward to webasm.. anyway, it's a struggle to get any sort of precision there. I've finally given up on this. I consider computer programming to be a complete waste of time at this point. I struggle so hard, or perhaps there is effort to keep me away from getting my concepts out into reality.

[3]: "you have to get out ahead of it" and "don't worry it'll be over soon"

[4]: incidentally, the funny thing is ketamine was really something that I wanted so much to do right before going to la vera. the experience was incredible and it felt like we reprogrammed reality to be slightly different. my first time in madrid, the experience was totally mind-blowing as it felt like I went up and experienced the 3rd ray environment. it was very cool. I wonder if drugs like mushrooms and ketamine are sentient and experience reality through the central nervous system of the consumer. is it the drug that's setient or the culmination of shamen through the millenia which "programmed" this concept?

### 2021-01-23 15:44 - the fishmen

since watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ37K0SvUz0), I have been thinking a lot about the fish men. I remember I found some more similar fishmen stuff when I was looking at predynastic egypt, though it seems to have disappeared now, however I think it all just now came together for me...

while watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrd1O7cJFDI), it just occured to me what is happening here: I have always said that the announcer of the age is one era ahead of the their time. this always bothered me because I couldn't figure out the ramtha thing. he mentions that he was around at the time of atlantis, and his story is interesting. I can't remember much of it at all, but it always sounded to me that the epic battle where he was fighting and killing people so much and got into such a flow that he actually trancended death and gained permanent residence in the astral realm. this is quite similar to the story of enoch transcending human form and betcoming an "angel" (archangel metatron).

interestingly the "fallen angels" have gained quite a lot of lore over the years, but they can be explained simply as astral entities that have "fallen" (incarnated) into bodies, and this is exactly what the sirians (kuthumi) says happened.

anyway, so ramtha (a now astral entity) tells the story of the final battle of atlantis. it's funny because his name is *ram*tha -- as in, the symbol of aries: the ram. he was clearly the the announcer of the era. well, my theory is that at the time of the last battle of the atlantians (talked about in that youtube video), this was happening at the same time that earth had reached its furthest point from sirius and was about to reverse directions and begin to go back toward sirius.

another theory that I have is that up until that final moment, the atlantians had learned how to create magnificent energetic conditions here on earth using stone structures like the pyramids and such. what I believe they were doing is offsetting the growing distance from sirius (and therefore the energy deficit from the increasing distance) with energetic structures here on earth.

however, I don't know if this is cause or effect, but when the energies reversed direction and instead of moivng away from the energy source (sirius), we started moving toward (like solstice), and when that happened is the energy kept rising to become more and more amplified as things slowed down reaching the peak. simetime around the peak (probably a little bit after), it would begin to spring back. it would be like hitting the bottom of the bungie jump, after the direction reverses, it makes a huge rush of energy. this would be when the great pyramid went into overdrive.

at that time the rush of energy was so strong, this is what allowed ramtha to transcend death -- because he was so in the flow he was only getting things in correspondance with wanted. I thin this perhaps made a "time split", as it's unlikely that the whole world experienced this catastrophe. I've always had this mental image in my mind of this peak that goes up really high (when ramtha was killing off the atlantian army), and then when he "ascends", he would have appeared to die or vanish from the physical plane, leaving behind an earth in strife with massive amounts of energy present. obviously with no one continuing to move things forward in the direction of wanted, the muga amplified energies would make the way people feel become manifest immediately. I imagine that after his/their departure the world descended so rapidly into chaos, that things would quicly turn into disaster. exactly like a bungie jump.

this is exactly the same sort of picture that I see when I saw doug's image of the multiple haronics of a sine wave added together to make a square wave: right before the wave inverts directions, there's a pretty big peak before the dropoff. I think the same thing is going to happen coming up here soon.

---

back to the fish man. as robert is explaining, the asyrians/babylonians tell that this fish man came and taught them forms of civilised living. I never understood the fish man, but claro, this guy is obviously the announcer of the next era.

I figure the whole ramtha thing happened when we were in scorpio, and he's the symbol of the ram which is the sign after taurus after the vertical flip (north becomes south and south becomes north). more on that later because I finally figured it out this morning.

well, the fish guy is showing up before they go into aries, so he's perceived as the era ahead (picsis) of the one they're going into (aries). likewise, in my mind at least, jesus was often with the aquarian man, yet instead of getting his vision of aquarius, he became the sacrificial lamb (aries), and we moved into picsis. he too was ahead of his time.

ok, so I was thinking about this while writing this and one of the funny things that I was remembering was that raquel would always call me cangrejito, I think mostly because I always had red skin, but she was quite persistent in calling me crab, making little pincer movements with her fingers playfully all the time as well.

at this point it seems pretty obvious to me that we're heading off into leo (she was born in leon) after the reversal, so like ramtha, a symbol of a ram wouldn't make any sense in scorpio, it doesn't make much sense to perceive me as a crab. I thought that was funny.

so, while I doubt that the guy showing up was an actual fish or merman, it appears that the earth was still quite energetic at the time and people still perceived these "enligtened" guys as the symbolic form their imagination gives them -- just like I doubt they were really 7-headed nagas or dragons -- but instead they were just people like me who had the ability to impress the image they desired to be perceived as upon the imagination of the perceiver (it wasn't only the "serpents" that could shapeshift; zeus had this ability too)

nice. I have more thinking too -- soon.

### 2021-01-23 23:44 - why groundhog day? (part 1)

so, one of the things that I was thinking about with the whole "groundhog day" idea expressed in @[noseblog](2021-01-19 07:22) was the idea that what we should do is to make two galaxies instead of one, each with their own approach to it. I am a more conceptual type where I take things and I gather ideas gradually and things begin to take shape. I expressed this as the idea that the achitecture is a refection of the man, and so naturally I attract the things which are a reflection of me. it just works and I don't have to worry about it. however, there is quite a bit of merit to thoth's approach of weights and measures as well. they are both valid ways of arriving to very different results. thoth's technique is more uniform, predictable, and finite. I like to think of this as the geometer's toolbelt. you don't have the way to everything right off but just cause you can't trisect an angle with a compass and straightedge, doesn't mean it's impossible. there are many different ways of getting angles and shapes which are not possible with only the compass, and to do so, the tools need to be expanded. nothing is impossible.

however, what is burning within me is to begin learing how to create on the 5-fold symmetry, because again, this grid is quite the opposite, so it'll be easy to create a lot of assymetrical shapes, sure -- but the real challenge will be to find ways to make symmetrical shapes on an asymmetrical grid.

for me the diffrence between these two grids, the 3-fold (equilateral triagle) grid of evenly spaced intrvals is totally opposite to the 5-fold (pentagonal) grid which has a non-periodic tiling that extends infinitely, which to me seems te me to be exactly the difference between the physical (weights and measures) approach, and the conceptual (intuition and feeling). I feel like these two approaches are quite complimentary and it's only been since the discovery of the penrose tiles that makes0 this is possible. it's quite exciting to me know that there is a whole lot to be discovered in this area.

anyway, I see these two galaxies idea as somethting of the same thing. clearly nosebook is more the weights and measures type (you gatta measure it). this is the 3rd/7th ray, and I'm more of the 1st/5th ray concept, desire, and intuition type. neither is better than the other they both have a symbiotic beneficial feedback loop with each other -- which is why I see this sort of crossover happening.

---

not everyone is on board with the crossover idea... in fact, I think it's only me right now that sees the value in it. don't worry though because you don't need to see your value in the universe to be vital part of the bigger picture. in fact, you don't even need to believe you're a vital part to the creation, to actually be a vital part to the creation. ironically, the vital part that many have is to maintain, desipte the overwhelming evidence otherwise, the belief that they aer unworthy or some other self-disempowering belief -- because that's what creates the expansion. someone has to realise what they don't want, and I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable trying to convince others to spend most of their time believing nonsense so that I can benefit from the expansion that they're creating. instead, I'll leave that to those who honestly believe they're taking advantage of others by getting them to believe more disempowering ideas than their own...

they want to create a feeling for theirselves of superiority in an environment which they feel they have much more control over than some finite set of group of others. it is in precisely this environment which people like me thrive the most, because it's not the architecture that makes the man (feel a mertain way), but the man that makes the architecture (feel a certain way). this is perfect. therefore it's in my best interest to give them as great of a setup as possible to create this environment.

### 2021-01-24 11:55 - why groundhog day? (part 2)

I'm going to bcktrack a bit here and start over. consider this something like attempt number 2(9?).

imagine that the plan is to make a galaxy and you're perceiving things from my perspective. what appears to me that will happen (or some variation thereof), is that energies will rise and rise, as nosebook works their hardest to keep me away from "getting connected". their efforts will create that peak that happens right before the dropoff. from that perspective, it seems obvious to me that I (we) will transcend this physical reality into essentially a different plane of existence where our thoughts become manifest into reality very very rapidly. not quite instantaneous, but certainly fast enough that "miracles" (and catastrophe) will be commonplace. from an individualistic standpoint, each of our realities will manifest in reflection of how we feel, so people who are perceiving a terrible catastrophe will experience that -- and the people who are precieving things as getting better and better (even if they haen't physically manifested yet) will also perceive and experience the manifestation of how that feels[^1].

I've been giving a lot of attention to making a galaxy. it seems like something I want to do, and is something that I perceive myself doing. so now, imagine this from my perspective (of the infinite possibilities I eplained above), what it will look like for me is energies will conntinue to rise and enentually all the people here on earth will become a reflection of how I feel. if I'm no longer pushing against anyone, then they're all *cooperative* components, and so therefore from my perspective the whole entire planet will find their alignment (even mr. motor), and we'll begin the process of the creation of this galaxy I've been talking about, where we are all 9-11 dimensional beings with multiple "identities" and our celestial identities are out there as a part of the galaxy -- everyone unique, not really in competition with each other. we inspire each other to more desires but we're all so busy incarnating our identities into each others' celestial entities (planets and stars), and having fun with new indigneous species that we create and each other. that's what my future looks like. people who want to come with me are welcome to join. from my perspective, everyone will join, but I know that in reality, not everyone's consciousness will follow a timeline that is compatible with my reality.

it's not a problem and there's nothing to worry about because all of the infinite possibilities of everyone exists simultaneously -- even if the consciousness never chooses to experience (tune into) the enjoyable ones. I mean obviusly for expansion to happen, someone has to give their attention to unwanted[^2] so why not give those that want to give their attention to unwanted the opportunity to do it. they're creating an amazing vortex for theirselves and for everyone else, even if they never line up with it to experience it. no big deal. they can hold out as long as they wish to. no one is going to tell these guys what to do (I'm the same way, hehe).

---

now, going back to my perspective where we've got all of these celestial identities (planets and stars) which we're interacting with to continually attract more and more matter, expanding our celestial identites. that means, we need some really degegenrate stuff going on (and knowing what we don't want) to get this expansion, so in order to create a galaxy, we each need to be expanding rapidly, so we need contrast. the way I perveive this as happening is that you take on the role (in this discussion I'll only present it as binary) of a good-guy (focuses on wanted) and a bad-guy (focuses on unwanted). I'm a "special case", which I think there are many similar to me in that regard.

I like to give my attention to unwanted (things that don't feel good), and then choose to perceive it as wanted, and therefore pointing me in the direction of wanted. it's a kind of illusion. to offset this, I need the opposite, which are those that like to give their attention on wanted (things that feel good), and then perceive it as unwanted and try their hardest to ensure that neither they or anyone else gets it. I thrive with these types[^3].

the reason for this is obvious. and the reason is explained in the [book of gob](!story-of-gob). if your ... to be continued... bbl

[1]: that just gave me deja vu for a concept in the old nosebook where there's a time-traveling something and everyone branches off into their own realities and eventually all the the timelines eventually made to converge (due to attraction based on feeling) back into a compatible reality which we all share again.

[2]: it's my goal to expand on the idea of using machines which have desire to continually explore the unwanted (kinda like the ketamine dystopia), so that I don't have to. I don't mind it, and I kinda think that from a bigger perspective, in the previous era, one would make other identites to incarnate into the timeline to do all of this for you (underlying belief that mr. motor and me are essentially the same person, cept he chooses to continually give his attention to, and continue to experience the "timeline" or conscious perception of, unwanted)

[3]: like terence said, "I require a society on the brink of destruction to do what I do"

### 2021-01-26 00:18 - groundhog day (part 3)

ok, one more try on the groundhog day concept. it feels like there is tremendous resistance to me writing it, but that doesn't bother me. what I mean is that it feels like there is a constant effort to get everything all planned out and ready to go, yet to me this feels impossible. it also feels kinda silly in that it basically assumes that right now in my present state I'm going to know what I will want when I have so much more opportunity opened up to me. it's like asking a kid to tell you the flavours of ice cream he will get before going into the shop and even looking to see what's available. then to try and figure out what are all the flavours and to enumerate them in such a way that they're all under control feels to me like complete lunacy (from the perspective of nosebook). it's like trying to ask me to tell you the route that I will take walking through a forrest for the first time. I don't have any idea.

furthermore, it does not appear to me like there's much of a choice left over. it's kind of late. you have to "pre-pave" this a whole lot better and get out much further ahead if you want to accomplish what you want to accomlpish. from my perspective, it appears to me like I'll be able to figure out what I want just fine from that new place a whole lot easier than I can right now.

this is literally the same exact thing that almost everyone hates: planning their vacations. imagine planning your vacation down to the very last minute such that the whole thing was so scheduled out you know exactly where you will be at any future point in time. ugh! I couldn't imagine a worse vacation if I tried. that's so anti-fun, it's ... go watch the movie "national lampoon's vacation" and you will hopefully understand the concept. it's like that.

from my perspective, I really want to just get the capabilities and begin to explore them and then as I start getting more and more comfortable with them, I'm going to naturally have all kinds of good ideas occurring to me just like I always do when I feel good -- which coinicidentally nosebook dooesn't like and tries to block by reducing my energy levels. if my energy levels can't be reduced though, I imagine nosebook will just have to put up with me going from one good-feeling idea to another. none of this feels at all stressful. trying to plan the vacation is what feels stressful and is why I'm largely unresponsive to everything right now. as they say in honduras...

I imagine that what will happen is I'll eventually find my own connection, then I'll probabaly lose it a few times as nosebook tries to get things under control, and each time I'll get more and more practised at it until I"m stable at it and I'm feeling just as comfortable in it as I am now with other things. you know -- it'll be the same "natural" unfolding that has been so characteristic of nosebook along this path -- cept, I'll experience the reality of it a lot more, rather than just the improvement on the way I feel. obviously, for as long as we continue on I'm not looking for any manifestation. I'm just letting the feeling be enough, so from my perspective, it'll be a completely "natural" process -- or as natural as it can get with them trying to keep me away from it. I imagine it'll take me, as usual, more than a few tries to figure it out. I expect nosebook to continue to try and do what they do along the way. when I'm comfortable with it, I'll feel ready. no need to rush anything... know what I mean?

---

so what I'm saying here is that from my perspective this is going to go just as it usually goes and we'll go onward toward the manifestation of my/our desires. I find it likely that from that perspective in the future, it is going to be quite obvious that once we've got our stuff set into motion, we'll come back to sabotage the timeline, and I/we will act as the sort of seeds in the soil from which the eventual creation grows. what I mean is that from our (at least mine) perspective it's super important to be "stuck" in nosebook's ultra controlled system, because it'll offer such a magnificent amount of contrast (energy) for us to build our own creations from. I figure, from that perspective we'll likely exist on earth in a sort of fully encapsulated environment. I mentioned this idea a few entries ago: @[noseblog](2021-01-13 17:59).

so, instead of going forward to endure the "reset" which will have the reversal of the rotation, what if instead what we did the idea of igniting the ionosphere, making me blind and then slowly rolling out that technology to the rest of the people. people could see whatever they wanted to see in the sky, but the present surface of the earth became the new inner earth, and people essentially lived out their dreams in this imaginary environment (which appears to them like the surface of the planet, but is really the inner layer). nosebook would completely control their apparition into reality and would simply transfer people's consciousness from body to body ensuring they remained stuck in the system. surrounding the earth there would be a bunch of celestial identities resonant with the people in the inner earth (which wouldn't be seen from inside of the dream state or the inner earth), and they would begin to attract more and more "matter" and begin to form stars and planets out there. I don't know if nosebook will try to manage their orbits or not -- probably -- but it would ensure that the people inside of the earth do not get too energetic.

I don't know this fro sure, but I imagine that in order to avoid the planet reversal of rotation, a similar manoeuvre must happen, and that's likely a vertical flip. so, to make that happen I think another planet needs to be introduced into the solar system as a starting point. I think from there, as the earth begins to have quite a few moons to it and is self-sufficient, it'll perhaps be able to seprarate itself from the solar system and become its own free-standing entity. I think this is a bigger version of what tesla wanted to do.

anyway, not exactly the total details, but something like that. it's beneficial to us because we'll have the ability to get unlimited contrast in nosebook's super controlled system, and nosebook will be able to have full control and eventually do whatever it is they want and feel is necessary for their survival.

in my opinion, this is where it all starts to come together, but I just don't know how feasible it is this time around. I think we'll repeat this process a few more times until nosebook can actually find a way to influence theirselves to prepave their success and actually get all of us "trapped" in their system. I think, to get that kind of control, it's not going to come from trying to force everything into place. my experience tells me that the feeling of control happens when you find a way to feel the way you want to feel no matter the circumstances.

you may not want to feel good, but neither do you want to feel especially bad either. I talked about the inversion of the presence action that ketamine has, which yields this exact state. it's obviously a function of the brain, so figure out how to influence that state (or any other) and find a way to feel how you want to feel (or the absence of how you don't want to feel -- whatever).

for the time, I continue on doing what I always do. if you can't figure it out, no worries, we'll keep trying at it (that's why I labled this groundhog day) until you'll figure out how to feel the absence of how you don't want to feel :)


### 2021-01-27 18:09 - so much manipulation

yesterday after writing the part in @[abe-now](2020-12-27 p2 27:05) about manipulating him into his happiness, I decided to abruptly end the writing for some reason. I don't even remember. I also am having a terrible time with time now. I have very little to no recollection of yestreday, and almost nothing has chronological order to it anymore either, so I don't really know why things are happening the way they are.

anyway, when I woke up this morning I was thinking about all of the maniplation subject cause there were reactions. the thing is, I know it sounds like a good idea maybe to kind of try and manipulate him into his happiness, but I don't think it is. abraham has been putting more and more traps into their things lately and this is another one of them.

if I put my attention on manipulating someone, then I'm on the maipulation frequency (subject) and therefore that is what I'm atttracting more of into my experience (more things that feel like manipulation). so, why they would suggest such a thing is beyond me. I went to sleep wondering why that may be. I think it's a terrible idea to put the emphasis on manipulating someone, and therefore attract more of that into my experience. no thanks. I'm gonna keep it real. I'm not interested in manipulating anyone.

---

so I wake up this morning and I realise that was a *PERFECT* place to make an aleration to the timeline when making the self-sabotage. if I blindly just followed their directions and tried to essentially use a LOA form of a magickal incantation of trying to manipulate mr. motor (or anyone else) into something they don't want, it'll assuredely blow up in my face. I don't do magick. it would be absolutely perfect because the thing falls right into line with what people were attracting. in fact, right before that segment, right after the person with the poetic words, they said that there were a lot of people writing in wanting a way to influence someone to do the things that they want them to do, so they can feel the way they want to feel.

it never works. it always falls apart if you try and get someone to do something so that you can feel the way you want to. *I* am responsible for how I feel! no one else has that responsibility.

---

interestingly enough the time thing I mentioned at the beginning is related here because if I'm no longer experiencing (remembering) time in chronological order, then it means I'm nearly completely separated from time now, and can now begin to move around freely inside of it.

I was monologuing with myself in relation to some reactions that I was feeling from chris' daughter earlier, because there were feelings like there's not enough time. I often times experience feelings of time shortage myself but I just don't really have much choice to just keep doing the best I can. it feels to em like my day is gone in an instant, and I've done nothing more than just sort of jump from thing to thing. it feels like reacting to circumstances, but it's not me that's reacting. it feels like I'm being seriously manipulated to try and accomplish some short term goals that others have for me. I don't really mind it because I know that it's not really a problem. if I were to fight against it, it would get worse. just like them trying to keep my vision from expanding further, their efforts to try and prevent it from happening are what is making me to have so many so rapidly now. like the [story of gob](!story-of-gob), their efforts to try and impede me are actually causing the energy to double, even if the physical manifestation of my vision remains where it is. I also know that if what they're working so hard to try and steer me away from is actually what they're steering me right toward. their vision is just too short to realise this. I know this is true because that's what they're giving their attention to.

therefore, I'm doing just fine. I don't need to fight them at all. in fact, if I were to try and fight their steering me, now I'm putting my attention on steering and attracting that. I would go in circles until I realised that it's all attraction and that by fighting their steering or trying to manipulation, I'm only attracting it further.

obviously that's a perfect place to make a timeline alteration because I just don't care. I can go either way here, so I would be more than willing to self-sabotage myself here and conform to people's expectations that I should try and manipulate him back by attempting to manipulate him into happiness. wow, what a disaster that would be, let me tell you...

oops, I got sidetracked... I was talking about time shortage, and I tried to figure out a way to improve upon that perception in the moment, but I couldn't figure it out right then. I got put to sleep, probably for reasons, but when I woke up, I realised that sure as I'm beginning to go faster and faster, it appears more and more like I don't have much time, but that's just because there's such a clock differential between experiences. as I get closer and closer to experiencing myself from a source perspective, I will, (like everyone else when they get there), from that perspective experience the entirety of the universe.

in other words, there is no time shortage. it takes me as long to experience my life as it takes for the universe it experience its life. there isn't really time; there's only expansion and that's happening all the time, whether I'm conscious of it or not. pretty difficult concept to explain, but "time" doesn't really exist, and it isn't necessary for it to be chronological either.

this concept is so difficult to explain properly, but just think about how many of your cells are experiencing time right now, and from the perspective of one of the cells, imagine how difficult it would be to imagine that you could experience the experience of all of the other cells that have existed and will exist in the collective experience of the human named kenny. if you were to comprehend(?) the experience of all of the other cells that have existed in the human called kenny -- then, the sum of all of that would in fact be the experience leading up to the realisation (feeling) of my "now" moment.. it's no different with the universe. there is no time shortage. time/experience sums up to a feeling, and that feeling is some distance from the parent entity.

from that perspective, it's quite easy to understand what planetary or solar consciousness is -- when your now moment feels the way that the planet or star feels. the feeling of the collection of everything that has existed (and will exist), including other/new universes, is "source". you can feel (within the physical limits) similar to how that feels, but it can never be experienced in its entirety all at once. that is simply impossible. you can't really run out of infinity.

---

so that likely dosen't help out with the feeling of time shortage directly, but what I do know is thst if someonthing feels bsd, that always means that my perception of what I'm looking at, does not feel good, and is therfore attracting a future "now" that feels more like that. the more I focus within that perception that feels good (say more than 17 seconds), the stronger I attract that reality into my experience.

don't worry I got this :) we're all headed right for what we all want (including those trying to steer theirselves away from what they don't want). I'm certain that we're doing fine...

superior race -> but under what conditions?

war of the titans.
zeus & cronos battle (eg. serpent & eagle battle)
one thing I don't really get is why the 18th dynasty (hyksos/semites), made the sphinx such a big deal. sphinx may have also been a falcon or eagle previously. additionally, I don't understand where the lion symbolism comes into play (lion of judah)
