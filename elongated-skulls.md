### elongated skulls

- elongated skulls is associated with the nobility (elite) in plcces like:
  - peru/bolivia
  - melanesia
  - egypt
  - congo
  - stonehenge and ancient europe
- the common belief is that the paracas culture showed up about 800BC (possibily earlier) and died out about 100AD
- paracas sculls during that time period show up in both the areas of the black/caspian sea (caucases), and in peru, at the same time
- paracas probably were forceds out of the black sea area by some sort of invasion
- they appear to be a peaceful culture, not really having any weapons of warfare
- possible that the paracas again displaced by the nazca moving into the paracas territory about 100AD, but probably many of them escaped and later became the seed for the inca, or at least somehow intermingled with the pre-inca because red-headed elongated skulls have been found in the cuzco area.
