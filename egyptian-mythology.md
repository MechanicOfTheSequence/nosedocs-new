### confusion of jupiter/set and hera/venus.

in egyptian mythology, osiris appears to be saturn by all accounts. and seth appears to be jupiter (not mercury), as his sister-wife is nephthys making her hera/juno.

neith ia interesting because she is similar to nephthys, as the consort of set, but referred to as the cow goddess. the cow goddess is hathor (venus), but she has additional similarities to venus as well.

however, in mesopotamia, anatu is the consort to anu (main sky god), and is the mother of ishtar/inanna/astarte (queen of heaven). anatu has storis on being quite destructive like sekhmet. I figure sekhmet must be an earlier incarnation of venus -- probably when she was not in the orbit she's in now.

I theorise that sekhmet and anatu are the goddess depictions of the *comet* venus (likely recently ejected from jupiter), and inanna/astarte/ishtar is the goddess form of the *captured* regularly orbiting form of venus (as the new "queen of heaven", having now quite a brilliant celestial presence). I also say comet because with a long orbital period there would be a periodic ritual when she goes into battle (causing destruction) before her eventual capture. this could also explain her "virgin" status, still being quite young.

anatu is said to have put and end to yam (neptune) (the beloved of el (saturn)), which fits quite well with the story of the athenians defeating the atlantians (atlas being the first of neptune's 12 children).

there's another thing about metis (associated with wisdom, like promethuss), which is said to have been the mother of athena. metis is prophesied that she will have children by zeus so powerful that they will overthrow him. zeus tries to prevent this from happening, and somehow vulcan aids in the birth (in some accounts, "born of triton" (so maybe neptune?)) and then athena emerges fully armed[^1] and ready for battle. this fully armed bit may be a reference to that she will be rapidly entereing into warfare/destruction after her birth (aka anatu/sekhmet).

the swallowing up the mothrer bit (both jupiter and saturn) may refer to some effect that happens during the process these planets go through when they're procreating. I can imagine that if there was a big cloud of something, it may look to them like they "swallowed" the newly emerged planet.

the part about vulcan hammering may refer to some effect that the takes place on the planet which dislodges (through some sort of impact?) a piece of the planet.

however, this could explain athena's birth, but it certanily wouldn't explain saturn giving birth to jupiter, as jupiter is larger than saturn. however, I may note that we would wonder how I, being slightly larger than my mother could have possibly emerged from my mother. if planetary creation is something that happens as a product of fusion, it would be primarily an electrical event. not enough infermation to know yet, though I do want to know how to make planets myself, and certainly that is one of my goals I have for myself.

dumuzid/tammuz is also said in the epic of gilgamesh to have been one of ishtar's past lovers. tammuz gets a broken wing and/or dies, which is kind of like the death of saturn. other reborn dieties are osiris (saturn/cronos), and horus. it's obvious to see the time connection here. horus (kings) clearly are the "reborn" atlantians, which are allowed the rule the fertile nile area, while set (the red one) which I'm assuming from the colour of the lower egypt hat (red), that they get pushed back into the desert areas of the levant, becoming the the phonecians. the horus kings (like narmer) seemed to have come up from the south in "upper" egypt.

however the symbolism of the nekhbet (vulture) symbol for upper (south) egypt and the utu (cobra) for lower (north) doesn't fit with the previous suggestion, assuing you replace the eagle with the vulture and the serpent with the cobra. it should be the opposite.

however, this does not solve the similarities between hera/neith/nephthys being the consort of jupiter problem. anatu was the daughter of el (saturn) and her brother was baal (jupiter), which would make anatu hera, if she is jupiter's sister.

horus ruled the black land and set ruled the red land. black is often associated with saturn and red with jupiter (minoans, phonecians).

it appears that el is saturn and baal is jupiter. interestingly enough,


### velikovsk's planet gods:

http://www.varchive.org/ce/monothei.htm

- saturn / el / kronos / manda / osirus
- jupiter / adonai / zedek (melmhizedek)

Another cult—Isis is Jupiter and Osiris is Saturn. The death of Osiris and its return to life; the birth of Venus-Horus, the fight of Horus and Seth (the head of the Venus comet and its tail)—all refer to celestial drama played before the opeles of the world—and of Egypt.

### saturn-jupiter-earth conjunction

Therefore, when I presented to Dr. H. H. Hess in his capacity as chairman of the Space Board of the National Academy of Science, a memorandum (dated September 11, 1963), subsequently submitted also to Dr. Homer Newell in his capacity as Director of NASA, I included these lines concerning Saturn:

“Saturn. Tests should be devised for detection of low-energy cosmic rays emanating from Saturn, especially during the weeks before and after a conjunction of Earth-Jupiter-Saturn.”

### eye of ra / eye of horus

The Eye of Ra and The Eye of Horus look very much the same, and have been linked closely together in the belief system of the ancient Egyptians that goes back roughly 5000 years. The Eye of Horus, which belongs to the ancient sky god, is seen as part of the heavens, while Ra is associated with the sun.

But there is a difference between the Eye of Ra and the Eye of Horus. A symbol, known as the Wadjet, was one of protection and often takes the figure of a cobra. The Wadjet is known as the all-seeing eye or more commonly, The Eye of Horus. In this representation, the Wadjet is seen as a peaceful protector.

However, the Wadjet is also known as the Eye of Ra. When associated with The Eye of Ra, the Wadjet is seen as a destructive force linked with the fiery blaze of the sun. Horus can be sometimes depicted as the sun and the moon. However, he soon became strongly associated with the sun and the sun god Ra.

There is an ancient myth in which a battle between Horus and the god Set took place. During this battle, Horus’ left eye was torn out.

Thoth, who is known as the Egyptian God of wisdom, restored Horus’ eye. It was at this point, that it was given the name Wadjet. This myth also shows the relation to the waxing and waning cycles of the moon.

### eye of ra myth (and connection to hathor)

In one myth, Ra discovers that his two children are missing. He sends his eye out into the world to find them.
The Eye is successful in finding the two children but upon their return, The Eye of Ra is filled with betrayal as a new eye has taken her place.

In turn, Ra gives her a place on his forehead in the form of a cobra. It is also noted that upon the return of his children, Ra sheds great tears, which give use to human tears. These tears are also associated with the flooding of the Nile, which in turn produced fertile farmland.

There is a myth associated with the destruction of mankind, when Ra is said to have used the eye as a weapon against all who have defied his authority. The eye takes the shape of the goddess Hathor, in the form of a lion, who is bent on the massacre of the human race.

Ra has a change of mind and prevents the eye from killing all of mankind. Red beer, which the eye believes to be blood, is poured out over the land. She drinks it in large quantities and returns to Ra as a subdued goddess.

anhur is a lion headed god from the thinis...

eye of ra (right eye) is personified by a goddess. sometimes it's a lion (sekhmet/bastet), and sometimes it's a cow (hathor).

one myth has horus fight seth for the throne of osiris. set removes horus' left eye (thoth's eye).

set is like the "destructive" version of mercury (7th ray), and thoth is the creative side of mercury. this is probably why set destroys horus' left eye, and thoth (or hathor) restores.

in the same way, sekhmet is the "destructive" side of venus (1st ray), and hathor is the creative side of venus. there may even be additional interpretation to this because sekhmet takes on a loving form as bastet as well.

in da-vinci's last supper, there is an eye of ra above jesus, which I find interesting because I would have assumed that it would go over mary, and not over jesus. I would have guessed the eye of horus to go over jesus, however it's the eye of ra which is the goddess principal, personified by hathor/sekhmet.

I don't really know how to express this very well, but I had a brain haemorrhage where my left-eye (thoth's eye) was disabled, and when it happened, I had a definite experience where I met jesus and he entered into my heart. interestingly the key to "unlocking" the paralysis of my left-side, was to begin to learn to "accept" and integrate my emotions into my every-day experience. along the process (involving various mushroom trips and MDMA), I came to begin to perceive my right-brain (left-side) as a demanding little girl with insatiable desire. in berlin when I was going through various extraordinary experiences, learning, I associated this dorment partially paralysed side with the 1st ray (desire) female (emissive), eg. hathor/venus.

essentially, what I'm saying is that through various psychedelic experiences, I began to identify my left-side, which I personified originally as jesus, to later be this sekhmet/hathor 1st ray female that was sort of stuck inside of me. I always identified my right-side as vulcan, the husband of venus in mythology.

anyway, I find it interesting that this picture da-vinci is identifying jesus as the eye of ra (personfifed by hathor/venus), and not mary.

there's another strange thing associated with the opposites of these symbols, because opposite the taurus (hathor) is the serpent and the eagle -- yet opposite the lion (sekhmet) is the symbol of the man (horus). inside of the great pyramid (located in the ros-tau (taurus) mountains) is the symbol of the bull (hathor), yet very much out of the ordinary is the the combination of these other two symbols: horemakhet which is horus of the two horizons. which two horizons? well, logic says that it's likely referring to when the sun (eye of ra) is rising in the east, man is facing to see it, while the part facing west, the hindquarters, is in the direction of the constellation of the lion which is exactly the opposite side.

continuing on with this sym

---

unrlated to this, but it's quite possible that hephaestos is the creative side of vulcan (5th ray) and typhon is the destructive side of vulcan. the opposite of vulcan will be saturn (3rd ray) and his ordered/logical side is cronos, and his opposite "destructive" emotional personification would be something similar to zeus.

it's kind of an interesting thing to think about the idea of taking a destructive god like uranus and separating him out into various aspects, where they can fight with each other (saturn and jupiter).

### elephantine / upper egyptian triad as a symbol of mother and daughter

the strange thing is that this triad is two females and one male. usually it's two males and one female. also of interest is the concept that he is said to be the divine potter, making children in his image. his two consorts are sirius (satis) which is the mother goddess and they have a child anuket, which is very symbolic of venus.

in essence, I see khnum as the kind of bringer-togeher of the mother and the daughter. also, it's interesting that this potter guy who fashions childeren of clay (adam was said to be made of clay/dust) and fashioned in the image of YHVH as well. I propose that the upper (bowling-ball hat) egypt was in power during the time of the divine feminine and this is why this triad was worahipped in aswan/elephantine.

there is a connection here with the frog. the female version of khnum is heket/heqet which is depicted as a frog. the frog seems to have good symbolism as it it is amphibian, being able to breath water and air, walking on the earth. I guess the only thing a frog would need for it to embody all of the elements, would be to be connected to fire -- masculine or maybe able hto breathe fire (reminds me of mario for some reason). tadpoles also look a lot like sperms

### tree of life symbolism in egypt

strange synchronicity today I was watching a video on the tree of life @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Ven22mNSdPc?t=1458), and I could see that extending down from the crown, I noticed two masculine paths of 4: one is down through binah and the other through hokmhah. the feminine path comes up from the root there and extends up to the hidden unification in daat. I thought that this was a bit weird because one would imagine the vertical base to be symbolic of the penis and the surrounding part to appear more like the vagina. when we assume that the crown is shared for each left and right pairs of four, we get a similar configuration as the chakras. the heart joins the top 3 with the bottom 3. when perceved as two aspects of *4*, then the top and bottom are in infinite cycles with eachother. the next thing to notice here is that because the middle one (daat) is missing in the original design, then it can be seen that this one only happens when the masculine and feminine principals are combined.

the whole thing reaks of having dual symbolism. the bottom-most one (malkuth) is said to represent kingship, and as the root of the tree, I can only assume that, mixing the nile with the tree of life, to be khnum (the source of the nile).

however, the analogy goes exactly in reverse if you awe to look at this with physical eyes, and see the `daat -> malkuth` as the penis or a tesla coil. at the base is the primary coil, and the tip (daat) is the *receiver*. the "source" of the nile is the receiver, not the source. so, thst must mean that we must now invert the image to see the dual of this tree.

I want to relate this to the nile for some reason, because it gives me a new configuration. if I make the top (keter) gizah, and the bottom (malkuth) elephantine, then I end up with 3 + 5 + 3 = 11. the balance of 5 and 6. I believe that the body doesn't contain all of the 7 chakras. the crown and the root are "virtual" chakras, or like vortices which draw energy out of the earth (root) or the sky (crown). so here's the thing: if we perceive this setup as similar to the tesla coil, the root would be the ground (earth) connection, and the crown as the air connection to the receiver (usually a spherical or torus-shaped hollow body), we end up with a connection that is likely mirrored in the internals of the great pyramid which are not shown.



if we imagine the nile as a spinal column or the chakras, the dividing


### nile symbol of for the human energy system

using for reference: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Ven22mNSdPc?t=1458)

not totally sure what I'm seeing here. my initial ideas are:

- root: invisible/khnum (the source of the nile)
  - M0: malkuth (kingship)
  - F1: keter (crown)
  - F2: keter (crown)
- regenetive: (elephantine/aswan) will be
  - F0: jesod (foundation)
  - M1: binah (understanding)
  - M2: chochmah (wisdom)
- emotional: (luxor?)
  - F0: tiferet (beauty)
  - M1: gevurah (discipline)
  - M2: chesed (kindness)
- heart: (dashur)
  - F0: daat (understanding)
  - M1: hod (glory)
  - M2: nezach (victory)
- throat: (saqqara)
  - F0:
- pineal (giza)
- crown: invisible (spreading out toward alexandria & port said)

NOTE: the above is incomplete. when I started writing it I had the image of a duality where there were three parts of 4 shown in the tree of life (left, right, centre), then making these the triple tau. the thing is now, I don't see it the same way I did so I'm unable to complete the explanation. it was important in the picture to note that there were 3 sets of four, the fourth one is a virtual one relating to the five going up the centre from kether to malkuth. this became the balance between the outer 6 (3+3) and the inner 5. 6 & 5 balance is heart thinking. I also want to mention that I advanced the meaning of F0, F1, M0 & M1 in @[noseblog](2021-04-07 21:14). I see that part clearly now so I may come back to revisit this.

I think when the 4th is discovered, then the crown becomes virtual, and the root becomes virtual as well. the 5 chskras remaining are all fully used now, so everything shifts up (just like in vitruvian man):

- kether: pineal/brain
- daat: throat/structure/logic
- tiphereth: heart/source
- jesod: emotions
- malkuth: imagination

it's worth also noting here that if we apply this back to the nile setup, let's assume that giza will be the top and elephantine is the bottom. there is considerable evidence that this is the case because if you look at the zodiac, if the end of taurus is the top, then the beginning of libra will be the bottom. libra was always associated with elephants. I consider elephantine island to taurus mountain to run the full extent of the spine in this enlightened, all 5 chakras (not 7) enabled man. I would imagine that the macro is simulated in the micro, meaning that there are likely chambers corresponding to these in the great pyramid.

as I was looking at the vitruvian man pyramid configuration (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/yPdnpBSLoJw?t=194)), I keep wondering why there wouldn't be something located at ground level. they went to such extraordinary effort to get the floor tiles just right (ground level -- which is funny because jesod means "foundation"), that either the floor tiles (foundation) is the important part of that layer, or there is something located in the very centre at the same level as the floor and the socket. also it just seems so much to me like there should be a second "kings chamber" for the other side. the whole passage is aligned to the left of the pyramid's centre, the "trial passages" have a second indentaiton on the right side. correspondingly, the scan pyramids project detected a void aroound the area of the right pectoral on the vitruvian man is. additionally, I think this corresponds to the bent pyramid, while the "king's chamber" corresponds to the red pyramid. looking at the plan for dashur, it may be possible that there were actually 4 installations there, not only the red and bent pyramids.

### seth vs horus

watching @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrpyM5cEsss), I just realised when he was talking about the follows of seth in the north (lower) and horus in the south (upper). these fit in with the conflict between space and time. horus, being the rebirth of osiris (saturn) represents the time component and seth is the space component.

he goes on to explain that the myth of osiris may have been created to incorporate the culture of the conquered region (unification of upper and lower egypt). this explaination does seem sound, however, there is missing data here. osiris is killed by set (lower egypt), then isis (sirius) rebuilds osiris as horus, of whom narmer is the embodiment, which then, coming from upper egypt, conquers lower egypt.

so who was osiris then? seth (lower egypt) kills osiris, but we don't know who that is. it has to be referring to a pre-dynastic ruler. isis (sirius) rebuilds osiris (saturn) in the form of horus who revenges the death of osiris (saturn).


### egyptus

in the pearl of great price, egyptus is the name of two women, first the wife of ham and also the daughter of ham and egyptus. this reminds me of khnum, specifically the statue of "menkaure" with his wife and daughter, which I think, because the writings are scratched in, this is originally a statue of khnum and his wife and daughter -- or, perhaps ham, egyptus and egyptus.

the khemet lands (black lands) may also be a veiled reference to the black (khemet) madonna, or the daughter egyptus as she (the daughter of sekhmet) will return to rule over egypt some time in the future. this may be encoded partially into the lion goddess symbolism of the sphinx (TODO: johanna has a video on this).

### reversal of the nile

there are some interesting proportions to the nile which I see. depending if you look at the water flowing up or down the nile. the reason why I say this is because if we assume that elephantine is the regenative centre of the nile and giza is the pineal, if looked at like a tesla coil, giza will *receive* the electricity from the air (land of thoth) and flow up the nile toward elephantine which is the ground. along the way, I'm not super certain of all of the others, but the only other I feel pretty certain about is the bent pyramid being the centre (heart).

I find it interesting that the sirians list the males of second triad (pre-atlantian gods) as ra (-3, so he was a throat manifester) which could thought of here as set/space, and osiris (-6) as the time component. these later transform into the alantian triad of saturn (-4) as time and thoth (-7) as space. finally, the last triad is zeus (-7) as space and vulcan (-5) as time. these correspond, I think to different places on the nile as humans pass through different initiations.

### wepwawet

seems to me like the rebirth of the god ra into a military form. he is symbloised as a wolf (wild dog), probably as a kind of opposite to the lioness (wild cat) and the enemy of the shepherder[^1]. there's also an interesting reversal where the upper egypt (smooth, rounded, feminine) makes a sudden transition into military horus kings. if horus was really a chill guy then I wonder why his reborn (horus) self would suddenly become so militaristic.

why would a military god be called "opener of ways"? it may be referring to the a forced evolution, where some change occcurs, forcing an evolution and "opening new ways". not sure.

[1]: this also happened at a time when civilsation started to become aggricultural more than hunter/gatherer (aka shepherds).

### consideration of what green skin could symbolise

one idea that came to me is that different skin colours represented mean the type of person that it is. kind of like a racial denotation of ancient history. there are the red-skinned phnecians/etc, then there are also talk of blue skinned beings as well. I think there are also yellow skinned references as well (asians).

so, imagine that what they're trying to denote is a "ray". in my system red would be the physical and purple would be desire, making green the centre or heart. yellow would be emotion, and blue would be mind. there may be something here in reference to different primordial culture groups and their affinites. this may be a piece to the exodia human puzzle, too.

I find it interesting that ptah, osiris, and khnum are all depicted as green-skinned, usually in association with the centre (memphis, etc).
