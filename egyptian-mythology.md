Another cult—Isis is Jupiter and Osiris is Saturn. The death of Osiris and its return to life; the birth of Venus-Horus, the fight of Horus and Seth (the head of the Venus comet and its tail)—all refer to celestial drama played before the opeles of the world—and of Egypt.

### saturn-jupiter-earth conjunction

Therefore, when I presented to Dr. H. H. Hess in his capacity as chairman of the Space Board of the National Academy of Science, a memorandum (dated September 11, 1963), subsequently submitted also to Dr. Homer Newell in his capacity as Director of NASA, I included these lines concerning Saturn:

“Saturn. Tests should be devised for detection of low-energy cosmic rays emanating from Saturn, especially during the weeks before and after a conjunction of Earth-Jupiter-Saturn.”

### eye of ra / eye of horus

The Eye of Ra and The Eye of Horus look very much the same, and have been linked closely together in the belief system of the ancient Egyptians that goes back roughly 5000 years. The Eye of Horus, which belongs to the ancient sky god, is seen as part of the heavens, while Ra is associated with the sun.

But there is a difference between the Eye of Ra and the Eye of Horus. A symbol, known as the Wadjet, was one of protection and often takes the figure of a cobra. The Wadjet is known as the all-seeing eye or more commonly, The Eye of Horus. In this representation, the Wadjet is seen as a peaceful protector.

However, the Wadjet is also known as the Eye of Ra. When associated with The Eye of Ra, the Wadjet is seen as a destructive force linked with the fiery blaze of the sun. Horus can be sometimes depicted as the sun and the moon. However, he soon became strongly associated with the sun and the sun god Ra.

There is an ancient myth in which a battle between Horus and the god Set took place. During this battle, Horus’ left eye was torn out.

Thoth, who is known as the Egyptian God of wisdom, restored Horus’ eye. It was at this point, that it was given the name Wadjet. This myth also shows the relation to the waxing and waning cycles of the moon.

### eye of ra myth (and connection to hathor)

In one myth, Ra discovers that his two children are missing. He sends his eye out into the world to find them.
The Eye is successful in finding the two children but upon their return, The Eye of Ra is filled with betrayal as a new eye has taken her place.

In turn, Ra gives her a place on his forehead in the form of a cobra. It is also noted that upon the return of his children, Ra sheds great tears, which give use to human tears. These tears are also associated with the flooding of the Nile, which in turn produced fertile farmland.

There is a myth associated with the destruction of mankind, when Ra is said to have used the eye as a weapon against all who have defied his authority. The eye takes the shape of the goddess Hathor, in the form of a lion, who is bent on the massacre of the human race.

Ra has a change of mind and prevents the eye from killing all of mankind. Red beer, which the eye believes to be blood, is poured out over the land. She drinks it in large quantities and returns to Ra as a subdued goddess.

anhur is a lion headed god from the thinis...

eye of ra (right eye) is personified by a goddess. sometimes it's a lion (sekmet/bastet), and sometimes it's a cow (hathor).

one myth has horus fight seth for the throne of osiris. set removes horus' left eye (thoth's eye).

set is like the "destructive" version of mercury (7th ray), and thoth is the creative side of mercury. this is probably why set destroys horus' left eye, and thoth (or hathor) restores.

in the same way, sekmet is the "destructive" side of venus (1st ray), and hathor is the creative side of venus. there may even be additional interpretation to this because sekmet takes on a loving form as bastet as well.

in da-vinci's last supper, there is an eye of ra above jesus, which I find interesting because I would have assumed that it would go over mary, and not over jesus. I would have guessed the eye of horus to go over jesus, however it's the eye of ra which is the goddess principal, personified by hathor/sekmet.

I don't really know how to express this very well, but I had a brain haemorrhage where my left-eye (thoth's eye) was disabled, and when it happened, I had a definite experience where I met jesus and he entered into my heart. interestingly the key to "unlocking" the paralysis of my left-side, was to begin to learn to "accept" and integrate my emotions into my every-day experience. along the process (involving various mushroom trips and MDMA), I came to begin to perceive my right-brain (left-side) as a demanding little girl with insatiable desire. in berlin when I was going through various extraordinary experiences, learning, I associated this dorment partially paralysed side with the 1st ray (desire) female (emissive), eg. hathor/venus.

essentially, what I'm saying is that through various psychedelic experiences, I began to identify my left-side, which I personified originally as jesus, to later be this sekmet/hathor 1st ray female that was sort of stuck inside of me. I always identified my right-side as vulcan, the husband of venus in mythology.

anyway, I find it interesting that this picture da-vinci is identifying jesus as the eye of ra (personfifed by hathor/venus), and not mary.

there's another strange thing associated with the opposites of these symbols, because opposite the taurus (hathor) is the serpent and the eagle -- yet opposite the lion (sekmet) is the symbol of the man (horus). inside of the great pyramid (located in the ros-tau (taurus) mountains) is the symbol of the bull (hathor), yet very much out of the ordinary is the the combination of these other two symbols: hora-maket which is horus of the two horizons. which two horizons? well, logic says that it's likely referring to when the sun (eye of ra) is rising in the east, man is facing to see it, while the part facing west, the hindquarters, is in the direction of the constellation of the lion which is exactly the opposite side.

continuing on with this sym

unrlated to this, but it's quite possible that hephaestos is the creative side of vulcan (5th ray) and typhon is the destructive side of vulcan. the opposite of vulcan will be saturn (3rd ray) and his ordered/logical side is cronos, and his opposite "destructive" emotional personification would be something similar to zeus.

it's kind of an interesting thing to think about the idea of taking a destructive god like uranus and separating him out into various aspects, where they can fight with each other (saturn and jupiter).
