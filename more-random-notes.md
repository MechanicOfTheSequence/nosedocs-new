https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClxLDBbA5bQ

- christmas
  - odin is celebrated
    - odin seems linked to vulcan, who made thor's thunderbolts (one eyed/cyclop/blacksmith)
  - zeus rides a chariot driven by goats (saturn).
    - sacrifices the goats and gives them to eat for the people
    - resurrects the goats the following day
  - called saturnalia, after saturn. saturn (capricorn) is linked to the goat in this celebration
    - drunken holiday
    - one of the important feasts was juvenalia, which celebrated the children of rome -- that is to say, the indulgasnce of children in the "fertility" rituals
  - yule's celebration
  - baphomet's celebration
    - baphomet with the first is last and last is first cypher is rendered as sophia, or knowledge/gnosis (apple)
  - goat's (capricorn) celebration
  - dec 21 is solstice, then on the 25th, is the birthday of the sun god mithra
    - now celebrated as chrismas, the birthday of jesus
      - combines now the evergreen (pine/pineal) now being decorated with apples (gnosis)
      - holly (also evergreen), a previous christmas decoration is now symbolised as jesus' crown of thorns

### kmt / khmet school in egypt

- ham referrs to the caananites
- the curse of ham may have been a smoothed over reference to castration
  - noah = uranus (anu) and ham = saturn (kumarbi)
  - and the curse means slavery
- since the 17th century a number of suggestions have been made that relate the name ham to a hebrew word for "burnt", "black" or "hot", to the egyptian word ḥm for "servant" or the word ḥm for "majesty" or the egyptian word kmt for "egypt"
  - this seems likely to be the origin of the word "khmet" (eg. the pre-dyastic egyptians)
  - the bible refers to egypt as "the land of ham"
    - psalm 78:51; 105:23,27; 106:22; 1 chronicles 4:40

#### hamlet

- shakespeare's play of hamlet is a literary metaphor for some conflict:
  - evil brother usurping the throne
  - the king’s son avenging his father’s death
- the osirus, set, horus (and isis) story has similarities
- the cornerstone or capstone of the pyramid is symbolic of this stone
  - this capstone is the furthermost point and the first point of contact between two pyramids
    - great pyramid (on earth)
      - points upward (masculine)
      - fire (word for pyramid = middle fire or heart)
    - energetic/spiritual pyramid (non-physical)
      - points downward (feminine)
      - water
  - after the first touch (marriage) of these two pyramids, conncection is made
  - the pyramids continue to intersect further until they reach the "merkaba" configuration
    - both of the middles are aligned with each other
    - likely this is referring to the ages, where iron is where the pyramids are searated
    - water (pisces) is where they first begin to touch
    - they progressively intersect more and more with each up to apex
    - at peak alignment (merkaba), this is the golden age

- "As preparation for his upcoming wedding (alchemical transmutation) Rosenkreutz must first become a Knight of the Golden Stone. The fact that orthodox Shakespeare scholars haven’t made the connections to Hamlet’s mysterious friends, Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern, is a huge academic omission. In Act IV of the the play they’re unwittingly recruited to deliver Hamlet to his death, the inciting plot point that finally propels the prince into decisive action and a complete reversal of roles. Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are sacrificed in order to resurrect Hamlet — thoroughly alchemical symbolism — and nothing’s the same from here on out. Act V now powers through to its stunning conclusion because Hamlet’s transformation has quickened his being. All his actions now have singularity of purpose and nothing will stop him from killing his uncle, no matter who goes down with him."
  - this stone is (in my own identification), the stumbling stone, or the stone of self-sabotage
  - jesus predicts his own failure and assigns peter (meaning stone) to become the new "church" (or house of God)
- therefore, I believe that the play is really just talking about the "the small ham" (reference to khmet or caananites)
- also the word "bath" sounds a lot like "baptism"
  - in the bible, there are two major baptisms: by water and by fire. (there's also the baptism of the holy spirit)
  - baptism of water seems directly linked to the baptism of the holy spirit
  - the baptism by fire is a purging of undesirable (earthen) parts to reveal the purified gold(?)
    - the fire or smelting process is the repeated task of separating the desired metal from the unwanted bits (slag)
    - the separating is important point.
      - it involves division of wanted and unwanted
      - the whole is divided using some force (usually fire) to sparate wanted from unwanted
    - eg. separation of wheat from chaff
    - curse of the serpent to consume the dust of earth
      - implies a purification process where the serpent is cursed to consume the unwanted (physical) bits, revealing the spiritual gold/light(?)
  - clearly these are "alchemical" in nature
    - alchemical is transmutation of one thing into a higher or more pure form

#### the curse of ham

- the curse of the serpent was to consume the dust of the earth
- the curse of adam (man) was to be stuck in the physical and to toil (after the cataclysm)

- if we consider adam (man) to be the serpent bloodline (the atlantians)
  - remembered as the golden age of chronos (saturn)
  - the atlantians worshipped the sun or light
  - eagle bloodline was created by the alantians (serpents) to be slaves
    - the curse of ham is slavery
    - the eagle bloodline is commonly associated with the hamites
    - moses saved the hamites from their slavery in egypt
    - the isrealites complained and did not like their saviour from slavery
  - moses began the transformation from goddess worship (hathor) to a monothiestic god YHVH
    - spoke the everything into existence with a word (AIOM?)
    - is the alpha and omega / beginning and end

- next consider the transformation the dinosaurs made a long time ago
  - many dinosaurs grew to be very large in size and enjoyed a very fruitful environment
    - this environment sounds pretty "easy" with massive flora and fauna
    - gravity was obviously less as well
      - many of these prehistoric birds (which were pretty reptile like) were able to fly.
    - this environment sounds very similar to the atlantian environment
      - fruits and things grew enormously
      - little effort needed to be made as "the earth provided for them"
  - a cataclysm came and wiped out the majority of the dinosaurs
    - it seems like something altered the gravitation of the planet as well
      - brontosaurus won't be able to hold its head up
      - pterodactyl won't fly
      - most of the creatures were too big to maintain their locomotion
      - I think this is poetically referred to in the garden of eden as the curse to the serpent to now crawl on its belly
        - that I know of, there are no reptiles that walk very distant from the earth
          - even the lizards which are quadrapeds practically drag on the ground
    - many species went extict
      - I believe that the changing gravitational concerns divided these species into two:
        - reptiles
        - birds
      - this division happens as a result of desire
        - if the new environment doesn't allow for upright walking (bipedal or quadrapedal) dinosaurs anymore, then they must transform into something new
        - some did not want to give up their reptile form and choose to continue on being stuck to the ground
        - others decided they wanted to fly instead and became birds
    - there is a symbolic repitition in the "timewave" of the distinction between the serpent and the eagle bloodlines
      - interesting to note the food chain:
        - most large birds (of prey) which eat the reptiles
          - this symbolically repition exists
            - (the eagles) driving out the "snakes" from ireland
            - the redskin native americanas (phonecian/eagles) ridding the land of snakes
        - a considerable amount of reptiles consume the eggs of birds
          - this symbolic reptition exists in the stories of the dragon feeding on young girls

- now, if we consider the ham (cannanite) to be symbolic of the eagle bloodline
  - the symbols don't quite fit into the bigger picture but there is a deeper meaning here
    - ham (saturn) castrates noah (uranus), so he curses him.
    - osiris (saturn) gets murdered by his brother set (mercury)
      - isis (sirius) pieces together the pieces of saturn and gives birth to horus (the [reborn diety](!reborn-diety))
      - this may refer to the first destruction of humankind, when the dinosaurs went extinct
        - the sirians say that the humans at that time were really stupid and so they were aborted
        - this ancient reference to isis rebuilding saturn and making him as a man which "returns back to the father" is a fortelling of the future humans, neither eagle or serpent which come about as the "capstone" on the pyramid, when the ages when the male and female pyramids are first beginning to touch again (end of kali yuga)
          - this would suggest that if jesus is symbolic of that event, then 2kya was the end of the kali yuga???
          - this also would mean that the 18th dynasty of egypt was right at the middle between the kali yugas???
          - this doesn't make sense
        - the interesting thing is the symbolic time fractal associated with this second destruction of humankind
          - saturn was the cause of the deluge which destroyed the atlantians (serpents)
          - the great pyramid is associated with thoth/set/mercury
            - the great pyramid I believe converted harmful earth energies into beneficial energies
              - this allowed people to give their attention to unwanted (fear things) and not have it produce detrimental effects in the earth
            - the pyramid went into overdrive converting this energy and envetually reached overcapacity
              - likely this was known by the atlantians, noticing that the pyramid was getting more and more energetic
              - so they feared even more the failure of the pyramid, causing the pyramid to go even more into overdrive
              - the energy produced by the pyramid must be linked to DMT and highened sense of well-being
                - this made them incredibly smart and gave them tremendous confidence
                - their confidence is what inspired them to decide to try to conquer the world and overtake the athenians (eagles)
                - eg. the more they feared, the more the great pyramid turned this energy into DMT
                - this sense of good feeling and well-being produced by the pyramid gave them the confidence to take action on something that would result in the manifestation of how they really felt, which was fear and attracting a cataclysm
          - so, then if you look at the pyramid as set, he murdered his brother saturn
          - the return back to this connected state was said to come from the [reborn deity](!reborn-diety), which was rebuilt by sirius (isis) form the recollected parts of saturn (osiris)
          - this reborn diety was to come out of the hamites, but they rejected him as their capstone (or moment of reconnection), and so then a (self-sabotage) stone was placed instead (peter)
            - therefore, the traditional egyptian myth was instead used to be that the appearance of horus was connected to the sphinx, with aquarius in front and the lion in back.

#### capstone
- represents first point of reconnection between the intersecting pyramids
  - two pyramids (with sphehes around them) travel to a point where their spheres intersect.
    - the earthen pyramid (great pyramid) represents the nothern hemisphere
    - there is a corresponding energetic pyramid represented by the southern hemisphere which travels to where their centres connect
  - the two pyramids are the balance of male (fire) and female (water) forces
  - they also represent the fire (in this case represented by the southern hemisphere female or energetic) pyramid beginning connection to the earth (physical) pyramid and the return to have this fire energy again on earth
    - this seems to suggest that there is a geometric structure that must be created as a result of the different position that the earth is in, in relation to the pyramid.
    - the great pyramid may be responsible for a lot of the effects that we associate with the "great year" -- meaning, that when the planet points more in a direction with aligns with the four cordinal points (scorpio, aquarius, leo, taurus), then the pyramid emits a different energy in relation to where we are in relation to the equinox stars
