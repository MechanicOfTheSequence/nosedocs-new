# getting-pebbled

the list of sacrificial stones is starting to mount up, so I decided I would begin to make a list of them here.

### aristotle

see @[youtube](https://youtu.be/5RxSAScquPY) for a reference. at @[youtube](https://youtu.be/5RxSAScquPY?t=3347), diodorus siculus says, "aristotle who was called battus" ... well, battus got turned into a stone by hermes...

from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battus_(mythology))
```
Battus (means "tongue-tied") was a figure in Greek mythology who witnessed Hermes stealing Apollo's cattle in Maenalus in Arcadia. Hermes gave him a heifer on condition Battus kept the theft secret. On returning in disguise, Hermes offered to reward Battus if he would tell him the location of the cattle; Battus did so, and for his greed was punished by being turned into stone.

why, to kill the aether

### st. peter

the romans had 50+ gods and godesses that were to be worshipped, each controlled by powerful roman families.

so, after jerusalem was conquered in -63, and became a vassal state, the jewish religion began to spread in the roman empire. by the time of seneca, it was estimated that 10-15% of romans were jews. the problem is judiasm couldn't be controlled by the roman families (see: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/pJIiieYFWvI?t=680)). neither did it have images (idols) to be worshipped and wasn't controlled that way.

after jesus shows up on the scene, the christian church was a perfect way to regain that control.

### zeus
### einstein
