### 2020-09-18 18:?? - (2020-09-05 p1)

I noticed a few different resonances in their emotional scale. I used to go all the way down to depression and despair when I had something come up, however I noticed that instead of going all the way down, the last few months or so I noticed I may only go down to discouragement or dissappointment.

lately though, I noticed that I only go down to pessimism though, then right back up. I like pessimism because it's a lot like doubt. typically I noticed that I when I do go down, I typically only go down to the range:

9. Pessimism
10. Frustration/Irritation/Impatience
11. Overwhelment
12. Disappointment
13. Doubt

so, when I, for example get down below that, in the range of anger (17), dicouragement (15), or blame (15), it's easy for me gto get back to doubt (13), which is then really easy for me to skip all the way up to pessimism (9).

it seems to me obvious that there are a few other resonances between some of the emotional states, which allow for quick jumps too, for example between discouragement (16) and disappointment (12) ... (incomplete, becsuse I need to think on it some more)

### (41:30) - jumping back into the problem

I do this all of the time. after a while of getting used to this, sometimes it's a lot of fun to go and jump back into the prolblem to kind of stir up some more trouble again... why? because once I've established a new perception of the "issue", then I no longer need to worry about the issue having powkr over me anymore. once I go back into the problem, I'm not even perceiving it as a problem anymore, so it's easy for me to separate in my mind, the difference between the problem and the new way in which I perceive it, giving me almost like the ability of an actor, to be in the problem and giving it an emotional focus, yet at the same time, knowing that it's not a *real* problem -- but, a kind of "pretend" problem.

the point that I'm making here is that while abraham does guide people to go up and down the scale, which is *very* important, because without understanding that, what I'm saying doesn't make a whole lot of sense... what I'm saying is, that if the problem can be perceived as a "manufactured" or "pretend" or illusory problem, then it's easy to make these jumps. not everyone has the capablity of controlling conditions or manufacturing problems because that means you have a lot of control or something...

for example, imagine you are the illuminati or something that is controlling a whole lot of conditions -- and you are able to manufacture problems, then you can easily achieve what I'm talking about where you can jump back into the problem, and knowing that the problem is not a real one, stir up some more problems for the people who still feel like they are powerless to solve the problem. I think this happens on a global scale, and I think it's intentional, too. the goal is to continue to reinforce the belief that one is powerless to affect the situation, when, because the situation is controlled (in the case of almost all global issues), one really *is* powerless to change the situation.

so, it is, in my opinion (for me at least), it is of utmost importance to learn to change my *perception* of that situation, otherwise what happens is I just keep cycling around in that scale, going up and then fallling back down to powerlessness (22), then and up and then falling back down again. when changing my perception, when I do fall, I don't fall nearly as far, and getting back up is a much easier process, too.

when say, change my percteption, I mean to, knowing the laws of the universe, understand that the problem is, in fact, illusory, and it's almost always someone trying to control conditions so that they can feel better (pleasure or power are the usual ones).

#### (45:30) - getting stuck

as a continuation here, the reason why I used the example of the illuminati, is because, if one is so used to needing to have control over all of the conditions in order to feel like or be able to control the conditions in such a way that it feels like the problem is illusory, then they're probably going to have a pretty difficult time coming to the conclusion that *all* problems are illusory. I know that all problems are illusory, because source (and me too now in almost all cases) can look a problem and does not feel any negative emotion over the problem. all actions/thoughts are either moving in the direction of the solution, or making the solution bigger or more inevitable (from source's perspective). it's *only* as long as one continues to perceive the problem as real and tangible, that it continues to be perceived as a real problem (obvious, right?). write that down:

> as long as I perceive my problem as real and tangible, then my problem continues to look like a real problem

### 2020-10-11 20:53 - (2020-10-03 p1)

#### (45:36) - expanding the emotional scale

as abraham is describing these different ways that move down the emotional scale, I'm finding it quite comical because I keep getting these images in my mind where a person (no one in particular) is just barreling through life and they just see one subject after another with each one causing a worse and worse feeling emotion, but they refuse to get to the bottom -- depression or powerlessness, so they instead of getting depressed, they get angry or revengeful and assume that by getting really mad at the problem, it's better than feeling powerlessness -- which is true, but that's as far as they get.

they get real pissed off, then head out to meet up with the next subject which should make them feel depression cause it's the same issue hundreds of time about it, however, instead of feeling depression or powerlessness, they get pissed off and really angry -- more than last time even -- which is a signal that it's time to cool down, so they distract theirselves for a few hours from the issue, which makes them feel better. a few hours later though they head out to find the exact same issue waiting for them again.

each time the issue is getting worse and worse, yet they refuse to feel the powerlessness that they *should* be feeling in that situation and instead willfully adjust theirselves to maybe somewhere in annoyance, or frustration, anger/revenge or something like that -- but never powerlessness. so, by not ever reaching the bottom there, they're expanding the range of emotionans that can be felt in the negative range.

---

I find this process funny to me because the same exact thing is happening to me, hewever in the opposite way: (the analogy doesn't work so well in the literal sense of the emotional scale though) every time that I get close to feeling the top end of the emotional scale, something happens and instead of getting the full manifestation of the really good feeling stuff, I bounce back down to somewhere lower. in fact their entire job is to be able to get me to bounce back down somehow.

you see, this actually indirectly responded to the question that I was asking, which was how in the world am I going to be able to finally overcome their influence on me, because as it seems, in my estimation, I still have quite some ways to go, and being committed to the disaster like I am, it seems like I just keep making it harder for myself...

so, as I was writing out these thoughts just now, I realised that what is happening is when I keep getting to those good feeling emotions: like I said, their job is to find some way to influence me back into a less good feeling emotional state.

---

the funny thing is, they had been talking about how prayer works and stuff earlier, and I kinda wanted to stop and write about it, but I didn't, so I will here. you will notice that they made some points about how prayer is only attraction, so you can't attract for anyone else, but you can influence them. I felt a lot of people's confusion in that section there so I'd like to explain how I understand it to be. I'm going to take it from a negative point of view though.

imagine you are trying to influence someone with some satanic ritual or something intended to cause confusion. when performing the ritual, you are conjuring into that atmosphere all of that chaos, and because it has to do with tuning, the "location" of this chaos is where the conjurer is tuned to, which is why they often need something that "reminds them" of the person like a lock of hair or a peice of clothing or even some of their bio mass (blood, saliva, etc) to improve the "tuning" to the target's location. they conjure (attract) all of their chaos or whatever by putting a lot of thought energy into it, and so it is created. that's it. now, the person (or people in a situation or whatever) that they're targetting are either receptive to that energy or not.

like the person that was asking about love vs. physical attraction, the conjuruer (the person that they guy was feeling attraction/love which was confusing his thoughts) sets the atmosphere, and so you would think that the conjuruer is always dominant, but not always. in that question, the guy *is* receptive to good feeling thoughts, especially when coming from someone attractive, so that feeling dominated and it was hard for him to get back to the normal worry/concern/whatever thoughts. they had the influence.

this is why it's only attraction: let's say that someone tries to conjure some really bad stuff while focused on me (please go ahead and try it; I enjoy the practise), let's say they're conjuring (attracting) some lust and hatred into the environment while focsued on me. if I'm resonant with lust or hatred, I will feel it and can adjust my perception to find a more productive way of seeing the same thing, effectively making me less and less resonant with that until it no longer even is detectable by me.

in either case, the conjurer is attracting that into their environment, and will continue on having that in their environment for as long as they're receptive to it[^1]. the attraction factor is just mentally (or prayerfully) creating the environment which is more or less in alignment (harmonious) to the desire.

---

whoops, got off another tangent :) so, the answer to my question is easy to see. I shouldn't even need to explain it. if I can get so good at no longer getting bounced back to a less feeling place, then I'll continue to feel better and better and it'll just eventually become impossible for them to bounce me back to a bad feeling place. this is great news. I will say this though, because this also reveals the unwanted part of the same thought:

if they want to make a real good disaster, instead of expending all of their efforts to keep me away from that good feeling place, what they'll want to do is to preserve a few tried and true triggers that are sure to bounce me back into a bad (or less good) feeling place, and whenever they want to make a disaster, they can just pull the trigger. from there, I'll have to find my way back up again, and the better I feel, the bigger the contrast between those two feelings are, and so therefore the bigger the disaster...

---

you know, as a side note, I just want to mention my experience last night. I decided I wanted to watch sirius for the first time this year. it just started rising high enough in the sky in the morning for me to see it, and the sky was clear enough too. it turned out to be quite the experience, and I lost consciousness at the end, and this normally really bothers me, but I've gotten to the point now that it's quite fine that I get really far out with the stars, then I get reset back (eg. lose consciousness) or go backwards on the emotional scale. I remember that right before I lost consciousness, I was really feeling good about my situation and feeling good about the girls and stuff too -- like really appreciating it all, and that's probably why I was doing so well watching the stars. when I came back to consciousness, I didn't feel nearly that good, but I didn't really feel bad either.

it is annoying getting reset back, but I recognised that even though I get reset back, what I'm doing is improving upon my recovery time. I'm able to recover from lost conscoiuness really rapidly now, and that's kinda why I'm ok with this idea of pulling the trgger -- because it's the same idea. I'm headed off into more and more better feeling (and looking) places very very rapidly, when they have to pull the trigger on my consciousness and interject a very chaotic signal (which is why it sounds like loud hissing or static) into it, to remove my consciousness. I just have to get better and better at recovering. same sort of thing. sure it's annoying, but whatever -- it's all about recovery time, and like I started out with: it's expanding the width of that scale.

by expanding, I mean the same thing on both ends: if a feeling pure powerlessness and disempowerment is the very bottom, and you never allow yourself to get there, it essentially means you have to feel worse and worse until you can finally feel that pure disempowerment and so your capacity to feel more and more awful is expanding. likewise, if the feeling of invincibility and self-empowerment is at the top[^2], yet I'm never allowed to really get there, or spend more than a brief moment there (eg. not get much momentum there), again, I'm expanding the capacity of how good I need to feel to be able to finally experience that feeling of pure invincibility (because I attract it all, and I'm good at attracting what I want) and appreciation (cause I like the feeling of what's manifesting).


#### (59:35) - make a decision to focus my mind in the direction of how I want to feel

this is about the make more decisions topic, and I've been becoming more and more deliberate about the things I wsnt to *do*, but I'm reminded of the conversation I had with mom this morning, and I'm just now realising that I want to become more deliberate about the way I want to *feel*. I know I've been saying this for a while now, but it still hasn't quite sunk in yet, and I don't yet navigate purely on the way I want to feel, instead of what I want to do -- yet :) just you watch... positive powerful momentum will happen

> ... and they'll say, "what's going on with you? it seems like everything you point at just happens for you"

[1]: it just now wonders to me if it's possible to conjure stuff, for example that it's a part of their perception... like for example, one of the things that has never had any real pull for me is gambling or betting. what if I were to conjure or focus gambling thoughts while focused on someone, and then just go back to my daily life... would I begin to become a gambler? I suppose.. however I personally think this is such a monumental waste of time -- because *why* would I even want to do that? it wouldn't be cause I wanted to influence another person succeptible to gambling mindset into a gambler. they may get some practise from me on overcoming those thoughts, but it seems to me to be a waste of my time entirely. just go to a casino and order a few drinks if you want to practise getting out of the gambling mindset :)

[2]: I'm using the "power" words here cause it's easier to express my point to people who have not felt this way before, but it's so much more than that. the magnificence of everything coming together and all the great feeling of love and self-appreciation, and appreciation for the universe, source, and everything is such a powerful feeling, it's really indescribable -- so I just use the power words for this point.

### 2020-10-25 16:?? - (2020-10-17 p1)

#### (15:33) - vibration

as they were talking I kept getting reminded of tesla's earthquake machine. what it did, is periodically, it would make a movement, and when those movements matched the resonance of the, in this case the earth below, each time the machine made it's periodic movement, it was at the right time so that it added to the previous movement.

in order to understand this, think of someone on a swing. as they swing, they are making a periodic movement back and forward. if you were to track thier forward and backward motion over time, it would look similar to a sine wave. now imagine yourself pushing the person on the swing. you also push them at the same periodicity that they are swinging but that's because you are standing on the ground.

however, imagine instead of a person pushing them, imagine that there's like a rocket thing under the seat of the swing. the rocket faces in the direction of the person on the swing, and the person on the swing can activate the rocket periodically. if the person just randomly activates the rocket, you can see that half of the time, they are working against theirselves, meaning that if the swing is going forward, and they activate the rocket while moving forward, they move forward more rapidly. however, if they are moving backward, and they activate the rocket (which is facing fortward), they actually slow theirselves down.

you can't really help but to activate your rocket though and you do it every time that you think/feel, observe/feel, or react/feel something[^3]. it happens without you doing anything about it, and the way that it feels is basically your indicator whether you're activating the rocket at the moment the swing is going forward or backward. if the swing is going backward, then your activation of the rocket is actually slowing you down, and that's why you feel bad.

---

it's also worthwhile to ponder the periodicity of the rocket activation as a form of perception. imagine that you are swinging 30 times a minute, and you find that you are able to activate the rocket only when it's going forward. you may turn on the rocket only a few times each minute, but it doesn't matter, because you're only activating it when going forward, so you feel increased momentum.

one can think of the swing as an "opportunity" -- so if you're swinging at 30 times a minute, then you have essentially 30 opportunities per minute to activate the rocket and increase momentum. you can't really go much faster than that. however, your source perceives at a much more rapid rate than that. let's just say your source is running at 120 opportinities a minute[^1].

so, let's say that you've been releasing resistance and you haven't been contradicting that vibration (that is turning on the rocket when going backwards), for a while, then the momentum will increase and you'll begin to feel more power.

I'm going to skip over the power part because I don't understand it very well, but once a certain power level is reached then the person's perception will jump up to the next speed, and their perception will operate at a new speed. let's say that now, the person is running at 40 opportunities per second. each time that the person's perception increases, they essentially have that many more opportunities per second to activate that rocket in the forward (good feeling way) or backward (bad feeling way). that's it. the faster your perception is going, the more opportunities you have to shoot yourself in the foot.

---

ok, going back to the frequencies adding to each other. every thing is resonant with a number of frequencies, however, there are very few things that are perfectly resonant (like the boxes in the serapeum), so everything resonates at a number of frequencies all the time.

every thought that you think makes a feeling, or generates a frequency in the atmosphere, and everything that's harmonic with that frequency will resonate with it a little bit, so you're receiving a ton of information all of the time, and it's all happening at once, however you cannot be conscious of all of it all at once so your brain takes all of these things filters out unimportant stuff and gives you essentially a summary of those frequencies. that summary isn't usually the same frequency as the input frequencies, however it can be. when you're focused, it's pretty similar, but it will always have your "interpretation" or transformation of that frequency on it.

this transformation is your perception. let's say that there is a frequency that is in your envirenment that is vibrating at 15 cycles (you're running at 30), and it happens that all of those 15 cycles are exactly timed so that they occur at exactly the moment when the swing is going backwards and is closest to the ground (when it's moving the fastest). because this environmental frequency in it's untransformed state is exactly timed to go opposite your swing when it's moving the fastest, so this will feel pretty bad.

what you do though is, you find a way to perceive that same environmental frequency a different way, and maybe now it pushes you forward at a different moment, so it doesn't feel so bad. you can continue to improve upon your perception of that frequency until that same energy is now working in your favour instead of against you[^2]. you (and your form of perception) decides when you turn on that rocket.

what I'm saying is that no matter what the environment is, that energy can be used in some way. what I'm saying is that knowing this, one should be able to extrapolate that if that's true, then life should exist in ALL environments of the universe. all that needs to be created is a mechanism for the organism to transform the energy into something useful. it's also really important to understnad this, because once one knows this, it means that there is nothing that is not beneficial; there are only things that are not perceptually transformed into something beneficial. I believe my example speaks to this quite vividly.

---

so what is split energy? split energy can either be visualised two ways. I will provide both examples:

1. imagine that sometimes (let's say half of the time), instead of always firing the rocket when you're going forward, you decide to fire the rocket when going backward. this means that sometimes you go more forward, and sometimes you go more backward, however, there's no real gain in either direction.
2. imagine instead of one rocket, you have two rockets on the swing, one forwards and one backwards, and your thoughts are running in sync, however, sometimes when moving forward, you fire the backward (not good feeling) rocket. sometimes too when moving backwards, you fire the forwards rocket. the rest of the time though, you fire the corresponding forwards or backwards rocket. so, in effect it feels like sometimes going faster and sometimes slowing down, or in a sense, no movement at all.

---

after thinking about it a bit, what I think is happening for vision upgrades is the following: (this is primarily responding to a question/reaction from nosebook as to what I mentioned previously about the increase in power level and the increase in frequency of one's perception)

so let's gather the facts here. I claim that all of my vision upgrades are a result of releasing resistance (that is activating the rocket opposite to the direction) and by altering my form of perception so that things that previously felt bad, are now perceived in a way which no longer feels bad. this modification of perception is really the same thing as "releasing resistance".

nosebook does not believe me when I claim that it's all about releasing resistance, because it seems like I get a lot of vision upgrades when I'm out watching stars. however, we have also seen many other examples where I get vision upgrades in the following scenarios:

1. when there is a strong rain or snow storm and a lot of energy is injected into the environment.
2. during the sunrise, even if I cannot see the sun, often times clearing my mind (meditating), will allow me to get a vision upgrade.
3. during meditation, if I allow my mind to clear and I don't think any thought for a while, sometimes I receive a vision upgrade.
4. sometimes right after I wake up in the morning, when I wake up with a good feeling and I just allow the feeling to gather momentum and don't think in opposition to it.
5. sometimes when thinking about the girls, I can feel quite good about it, and that sometimes can cause me to get a vision upgrade.
6. sex (or maybe even a dream of it), can make me to feel pretty good (pleasure).
7. sometimes when smoking weed or other drug experiences that feel good (pleasure).

in all of these cases, what appears to be happening is that I am in a state where I either allow myself to feel better with some external (pleasure) stimulus can cause me to feel good enough that I receive a vision upgrade.

this appears to validate the suggestion that what is happening is I'm essentially passing over the barrier to the next power level. or, in the previous example of the bathtubs, the water is splashing over to the next layer. in fact, this is exactly what it feels like to me and where I got the idea for the bathtubs, because when I star-watch, clearing my mind of all "important" or "top priority" thought, my mind begins to glide, as it does in meditation and I begin to feel better and better. it's that better feeling that one experiences when in a dream-state.

usually as I approach this height more and more, it often times feels like I'm beginning to lose consciousness, which is why it's so hard for me to actually maintain my consciousness when star-watching. sometimes I'm more conscious of the process than other times, but I know when I've hit it, because instead of a continually upward feeling, suddenly it changes directions and I feel like it's going downward. this feeling is similar to the feeling experienced when mushrooms actually had an effect on me, and most people call this this the "coming up" phase, and it feels like a physical disorientation, because my perception is beginning to vibrate more rapidly.

taking the experience of mushrooms though, you will notice that even if you see at a higher frequency on mushrooms (artificially more DMT is in the brain), when the mushrooms wear off, your vision will return back to the frequency it was previous if no lasting changes have occurred.

essentially, in all of those experiences, I am stimulating the production of more DMT in the brain by feeling good (excess serotonin produces DMT), or by simply not thinking thoughts which make me feel bad. my brain is literally producing more DMT because my perception allows it. sometimes, when nosebook pulls my consciousness, they reset me back to the lowest DMT level, probably by putting a lot of chaos in my head until it's lowered. when I come back to consciousness, I perceive at the rate of DMT which my brain is producing. the brain (or maybe it's the blood, not sure) has a quantity of DMT in it, and the normal person, any injection of DMT lasts for a while until you think thoughts which are contradictory and the brain removes that DMT from the pool.

my case though, nosebook is trying to keep my pool essentially empty, so the amount of DMT (or the frequency of my perception) is limited to the amount of DMT my brain can produce. that production is determined by my perception, or how much my body thinks it needs to produce more to be at the level of perception which matches the way I feel.

when I star-watch or meditate (because they're essentially the same thing, which I will demonstrate this wintertime), what seems to be happening is, that I allow my DMT levels to rise up higher than they previously were, and the water goes to the next bathtub. let's say I started with 100 tubs full, and then I manage to get it up to 110 tubs. when nosebook takes away my consciousnses, essentially discontinuing my ability to continue to increase that momentum (fill up more tubs), the amount of water is essentially lowered down to a lower level, and when I come back to consciousness the tubs refill to the production rate ...

my form of perception is like the rockets on the swings, which is essentially timing. I can't explain it mathematically here very easily, but those rocket timings essentially determine the pressure applied to all of the tubs (standing wave) causing the water to go back and forward. this increased pressure in each tub (cause of the change in timings), causes the water to splash over more easily.

the example here breaks down a bit but just go with it. instead of each tub being equal in length, say that the tubs follow some sort of pattern increasing in width, with the smallest ones being nearest to the left-most tub (the source of the water)...

I'm really struggling to get this example out, but imagine maybe that water = oxygen, and tubs = DMT. the more tubs (DMT) you have the more frequencies you can resonate at, thereby giving you more tubs to work with (this is to illustrate a wide range of frequencies, like a fourier section, even though it's really a  continuous spectrum and there are no literal tubs).

all tubs are filled to some level (the amount of that frequency you're giving your attention to) and they're all sloshing back and fourth at the frequency resonant with the size of the tub. imagine that all of the tubs have some water in them, but they're sloshing around at the frequency of the timing of the rockets associated with your perception, so when I lose consciousness and all the tubs' water (oxygen) level is lowered, but it's impossible to empty them completely. so, when I come back, the tubs which don't have any water in them don't have any sloshing, and the ones that have water in them are affected by the rockets of my perception.

when I have never increased the vibrational speed of my perception artificially, the only way for me to achieve that new speed is by gaining powerful enough sloshing in a harmonic tub, allowing it to slosh over into the next tub. that way is sort of slow, so in order to experience the higher frequency, one needs to stimulate the production somehow. once that production has been stiumlated, and the brain begins to produce more often the water in the frequencies of the previous experience. meaning, that once the brain has had the experience of a frequency, it will begin to produce that same frequency unless it is determined that frequency is unwanted, or not important. therefore in order to expand one's perception, one must stimulate it artificially to a new height.

when reaching that new height, this essentially fills the tubs of those frequency ranges with water, and now your brain, having had that experience, can now copy that, and begin to produce it more easily on its own, unless of course, your rockets of perception are actually inhibiting that production by going the opposite direction (destructive interference).

---

that was super unclear, I realise, but the important thing to notice here is that the brain essentially only copies and reproduces vibration it has previously experienced. if one never experiences a new frequency, the brain cannot reproduce it. in that way, it's kind of funny, because by allowing people to temporarily run their perception at my frequencies, nosebook is allowing people's brains the opportunity to gain some experience at that higher frequency, even if their perception doesn't yet allow it. this experience is very similar to eating mushrooms or smoking DMT, to temporarily allow someone to experience a higher frequency of perception. then having experienced it, it becomes later much easier to alter one's form of perception to allow the brain to begin producing more water in those higher frequency buckets.

what is happening for me is that nosebook is essentially destructively interfeering with the different tubs in my head, and if they wanted to try and create a system that was more effective at holding me back, they would need to find a way to anticipate those tub frequencies (they should be periodic), and to with every vision upgrade I get, automatically begin to destructively interfere with those new frequencies.

actually, this would be beneficial for me because then they wouldn't need to constantly take away my consciousness all of the time, and it would also take away the "runaway vision upgrades" -- where after I get one upgrade, it gets easier and easier to get more and more, up until a point which is basically the limit of my perception, and from there I don't really get more, or the ones I do get, get reset back, because my form of perception is still in contradiction to that higher frequency. essentially, by limiting me this way, I would essentially stop getting any more upgrades that my perception didn't allow. it would slow me down a lot. however, I will probably find a new way :)

I will say this though. if I were continuously limited like that, essentially meditation (or star-watching) would become pretty ineffective for getting vision upgrades and I would need external stimulus, like sex or drugs to experience those higher frequencies -- and even then, they would be pretty ineffective because what I would be doing with these stimulations is stimulating the tubs that already have water in them, and even though those tubs are getting their water drained, they will eventually fill up higher and higher frequency buckets which nosebook does not yet have the technical capability to drain.

from my perspective, it would appear as if I had completely stagnated, yet those higher frequency tubs would be filling slowly little by little because of the way harmonics work (harmonics doesn't fit into the tubs as double-layers analogy), meaning that at some point, given enough time, I would eventually begin to perceive at an extremely high frequency. also, I would imagine that it would be pretty difficult for nosebook to properly anticipate all of the higher frequency buckets with perfect accuracy, preventing them from filling up, so they too, I guess would fill up slowly as well.

another interesting thing about this idea is that because the tubs that nosebook can effectively interfere with, are all destructively interefered with, means that my brain would not gain near as much experience on those frequencies, as my brain would on the extremely high frequencies that nosebook is incapable of interfering with. that means that means that nosebook could pretty effectively remove all of the 4d and 5d perception that they're so vehement in keeping me from, leaving me to only begin experiencing the highest frequencies that they don't (yet) have the capability of interfering with.

by doing this, they could, if they wanted to, essentially stagnate me for a very long time, which means that I would have to find a way to outrun their technological capability.

---

after writing this out, I kind of want to make a simple program to visualise this so people can play with it and get the idea. maybe even like a simple game where critters interact with each other and their environment.

[1]: it's far greater than that. I only wanted to double the number twice for illustration

[2]: as momentum increases, the building momentum will eventually put you over the threshold to the next frequency, and the frequency of your perception will increase. obviously these cycle speeds are much faster, probbly going into millions or billions of cycles per second, so there's a lot more capability for those higher frequencies to harmonise with your new form of perception.

[3]: the important thing to note here is the feeling bit. reactions (from others), thoughts, and observations all can produce feelings inside of the person, and these feelings are the "vibration" that is either harmonising (feeling good) or is discordant (feeling bad) with your source.

### 2020-11-02 17:29 - (2020-10-24 p1)

#### (31:41) - stuttering

I can relate quite a bit to this question. I didn't have the case of stuttering, but I had the case of a stiff left-side, and the more I paid attention to other people, instead of feeling my own ease or comfort, the more it stiffened up (or shook).

as they say, the whole thing came down to me caring too much about what other people thought of me, and quite literally, it seems that the entirety of that condition was self-created, and actually the shaking or stiffness was a manifestation of that resistance. as I began to care less about what people thought, the easier it got to walk and stuff.

I have since noticed that often times that as soon as I release a lot of resistance, my left side seems to have this really easy feeling to it, yet each time that happens where I get the easy feeling, it's not long before nosebook finds a way to introduce resistance back into my left side again.

that used to bother me a lot -- I mean, *a lot* -- but as I got further and further along in time, I've realised that this really isn't all that much of a problem. it would have been nice if nosebook didn't go back sdo often to make my left-side stiff again, but I've found that each time it happens, I come back stronger, and now I simply don't worry about it anymore. when the resistance finally gets big enough to become a manifestation of something noticeable (in this person's case, it would be stuttering), then it's also noticeable what the resistance is, and it's usually a slight tweak that I can make to once again learn to not need to worry about what others think.

I don't know if nosebook is influencing things in people's brains to try and keep people's resistance high (or even why I felt like mentioning this at all), but I will say this: each time that I paid less and less attention to what other people think -- that is, valuing their opinion on something, instead of knowing (feeling) my own ease, flow, comfort or security -- then what happened is I steadily gained more and more confidence in myself. this whole process turned out to be a tremendous benefit to me. sure, it would be nice to have the good condition of feeling that ease in my left side, but I know that for as long as they keep the resistance applied, and for as long as I continue to feel it, then *I am resonant with that resistance* and I can do something about it, ensuring more confidence in myself.

let me tell you, having been around rich people for a considerable portion of my life -- the ones that are not net confident in theirselves, know how fragile that condition is, and fear losing their money. however, ones who are confident and know their ability to create their own monetary reality aren't scared of losing the condition.

the confidence that one gsins from continually releasing resistance creates an undenable feeling of invincibility. so, while your sensitivity may be manifesting itself as stuttering right now, with time, the the ability to find the feeling of how you really feel, and continued application of this "true" opinion of yourself (however you receive it) -- in contrast to looking to others for that opinion, will, in time, give you an undeniable sense of invincibility -- because you know how to find that feeling of ease, even when others are projecting a feeling worth stuttering over.

#### (06:54) - stubborn to your desire

> why are you stubborn to your own desires? who cares. maybe you learned it from your mother or from a teacher [like nosebook's dream teacher]. it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter why you're pushing against. but, the good news is you can feel you're pushing against it. you want to push against it. and now, you know the reason why you want to push against it, is because it's on the wrong end of the emotional scale in terms of where your inner being is.

I had to write this one out because I didn't really get what they were meaning because they talk really fast. when they said, "you want to push against it" it caught my attention, because why would I (you) want to push against my desires. they follow up, "now you know the reason why you want to push againht it, [which is] because it's on the wrong end of the emotional scale in terms of where your inner being is."

this is a reference to what they just said previously about rebellion. they said that any time that you want to rebel against something, you know that whatever is giving the feeling of rebellion is on the lower end of the scale.

huh, ok that's fine with me. the question seems to have the implication that (specifically in my case) by not cleaning my room, I'm resisting my desire. I suppose maybe that's how some people may see it, but I'm not at all worried about it.

speaking of dreams, I find it quite likely that nosebook *is* working against theirselves on this subject. I am 100% certain (and that's a lot of certainty) that nosebook has one team trying to get the desire to manifest, and at the same time, another whole team designed to ensure that I am delayed as long as possible. just last night, after writing down some of the the things and feeling people's reactions to stuff, I was feeling particularly good from it, and I wanted to lie down. I layed down and my feet were hot and I was starting to have psychedelic experiences like colours and stuff in my eyes just from calming my mind a little (not even full meditation), when I lost consciousness.

I became conscious in the dream where I was fighting greg and he kept trying to injure me in the dream, but none of the stuff he was doing even hurt, however it was pissing me off in the dream, and eventually I don't remember exactly what happened but, I retaliated in some way and then woke up feeling a lot worse than before, because I didn't really have that concept in me in the dream state. I felt powerless like I couldn't escape the dream, and that was the only way that I felt I could make the dream stop, cause I didn't like the way I felt in the dream.

later on that night or this morning (or maybe this was before the above event. I really can't tell. time isn't working in a linear order for me anymore) I had a dream where I became conscious in the dream and I started to begin to make anything I want appear in the dream and to fly around and explore the environment, however, it kept getting erased as fast as I could create it, so I had the instinct to try and run away from them (dunno why that made sense) or to try and overpower them in some form. I finally started to gain more capability to create faster than they could destroy and faster than they could hold me back when I lost consciousness again.

---

clearly, these are indicators to me that I'm still not ready yet. it may even possibly be that all the components are not yet ready, which is all good for me too. when I woke up I had a strong sense of what I wanted to write, and it feels to me like the process is still ongoing and I really want to gain as much practise as I can get right now. I really am not in any super hurry. we're approaching the manifestation mindblowingly fast and it's accelerating as we go so there's nothing to worry about.

also it feels to me like I want to begin gaining more and more capability to *transform* the resistance into something useful to me. for example, I've had some pretty serious vision upgrades lately, but my left foot feels extreme resistance. the indicator that things are about to manifest is that my left arm and leg will move around freely and with ease, like I sometimes feel before more resistance is applied again. soon, their resistance will no longer be felt, and things will become easy -- think the scene in the matrix when neo begins fighting the agents with one hand effortlessly, then stopping the bullets with his mind. it's a pretty much like that, but with vibrations (feelings) instead of bullets. my room being clean has nothing to do with it, so that's why I'm still stubborn to my desire -- because I don't have full power over my own vibration (where I'm at on the emotional scale).

in the previous segment, I argued with them because to me now, all of the feelings feel so similar that it's easy to move around in them effortlessly. they are no longer like a monumental difference between them, almost as if they are no longer big steps but a gradient. imagine a circle. on one side you have one emotion and the other side you have the opposite. let's say that you have optimism on one side and pessimism on the other. previously there were various "steps" that I had to take to go from one side to the other. maybe like 5 steps or something -- doesn't matter how many, but as I've gotten better and better at this there are more and more steps between (not less, like I would have expected) and they're becoming so small now that it's almost like a perfect circle and I no longer perceive the steps at all. I suppose I could jump around -- and I can. I can skip over some emotional steps, but I like to now just feel the change happen gradually and automatically because it's so smooth, and I notice small thought manifestations along the way, instead of needing to effort it like I used to have to do.

for those following my energy level, I recommend putting in the effort to make the transformation consciously because the practise is what makes the lasting change in perception, and truly makes you go much faster -- and the feeling of negative emotion for a little bit is a *good* thing. consider it like a free personal manifestation booster, and the better you get at making the transformation for yourself, the more you *will* feel invincible. this is why I specifically want to continue on where I'm going without the manifestation (subborn to my desire) for as long as possible. bring it on, because these improvements on my perception are beneficial for me and a lot of other people as well. we really have to trust that it'll all happen when everything is ready (enough).


### 2020-11-15 19:48 - 2020-11-07 p1

#### (11:01) - baseline feeling

in a previous noseblog entry, I mentioned that I was looking forward to feeling negsative emotion again. I literally have optimised my perception so much now (it's so easy!) that basically the worst I feel at moving around in life now is boredom, and only on occasion do I feel frustration, and it's not really all that frustrating of frustration. it feels to me like I just have that frustration as a programmed response because I get visibly frustrated, however I don't actually feel much or even any at all frustration. I basically never experience anger anymore. I can sometimes feel it -- like for example, when I was star-watching just earlier, I got a vision upgrade and someone got angry and threw something on the kitchen floor above me. I could feel the anger, but it barely even distracted me much. in fact, star-watching like that indoors now has made me realise how resiliant I am now to the distracting environment. almost nothing bothers me anymore. there are little things I can feel, but really not much at all.

anyway, it's totally true that since I don't really feel very bad about anything anymore, almost everything in my life is pretty much easy now and matches how I feel. the other thing they said I have also experienced a lot of as well. I was taking about being aware of my emotions first in the context of an emotional state machine -- and so instead of being a action state machine, where I go from doing one thing to doing another thing, now I just go from feeling to feeling.

there are some "drawbacks" to it though, like for example I haven't really felt like programming much. I do want to make some of these documents a little more organised and the concepts better connected, because my ability to perceive is expanding at such a rapid rate right now, I want to turn a lot of these concepts into documents, because I think if you were to try and understand some of the stuff I'm talking about, you would need 5-30 more related concepts to get the bigger picture of what I'm talking about. even simple stuff like the emotional state machine is a concept I should just define, because it took me a while to figure out what this is and how that is how our DNA works, so it's pretty important. however, because I haven't really *felt* like it was something I wanted to do, I haven't really approached it. the whole programming thing has this dead uninteresting feeling to it.

I noticed today when I was thinking about the friendly harbor, and I wanted to go back, but every time that I've considered the idea, it has the same dead uninteresting feeling to it like programming does. clearly nosebook doesn't want me to program, and I'm ok with that because I don't mind trying to boost my feeling with the physical condition of programming, but my memory is getting so bad now and I find myself really struggling to conceptualise stuff, that I'm desiring more and more to have a way to organise it and get it out. that's probably what I'll be spending most of my time on it. I've been writing a lot lately, and I think instead of writing noseblogs I'll write concepts and some markdown parsing code.

something like that. wow, I totally got off-topic here, lol...

#### (22:50) - your inner being lands in joy and you're over here in pessimism, you don't feel so good

I could feel a bit of a reaction to this one, because the assumption is that both my inner being lands in joy (they certainly are there in joy) and that I land in pessimism, which I don't fully agree with.

I don't consider myself at all to be in pessimism. I think that people have a very difficult way of perceiving their "attraction" of reality. when they were talking about earlier, what you're *giving* your attention to, and what you're *getting* in response to that -- is illustrating this quite well, because most people think that to attract something, you have to go out there and *get it* -- as in, they need to work really hard to try and get it. this simply is not so.

I have been star-watching for quite a while now so I know how long it takes to get a vision upgrade. at first I was pretty unconscious of the process of slowing down the resistant thoughts in my mind and focusing, and it seemed like every time it happened, it happened by accident. in fact, it felt as if I couldn't really figure out how to do it other than to spend a lot of time at it, and the persistence would pay off. later I found out that it had a lot to do with how emotionally charged up I was, and I had to settle those things down.

at first, slowing the "big issues" in my mind was a very difficult thing. they felt like something so big and important and I should just keep thinking them over until I came to a solution (I'm very tenacious and it's hard for me to drop things). even to this day, for example this morning I was even having trouble stopping to pay attention to the reactions to both of this morning's entries. two times today I had to begin to let those "important issues" go from my mind -- and it was to let them go. it's easy for me now because I know that I don't need to worry about that stuff. I kinda enjoy feeling out the rections at times, but I know that if I just stop the reactions, especially the emotionally charged ones, my source has it just fine, and I can instead tune into the "summary" feeling and get the source perspective, instead of all of the individual emotionally charged ones.

what I want to say here is: step one to successful star-watching is letting go of important subjects in your mind, and trusting that you can instead tune into the source perspective of it -- which usually does not have any words at all, and is just a feeling like it's all fine.

as I begin to relax my mind, often times a lot of weird chaotic thoughts pass through my head. at first this alarmed me because they were real voices from real people, and sometimes they were even related to some situations, but I've found out over the years now that this is just noise that had some slight resonance with me, like maybe I just saw them or heard that, or whatever. nowadays, I even get stuff that's completely unrelated, maybe like a random people having a conversation or something, and I don't even worry about that stuff anymore now either. it's like when going to sleep, in that transition zone, sounds, voices, images and colours pop into my experience between wake and dream state. the important thing is to not worry about the stuff and to just let it be. this is also the same technique to become conscious in your dreams as well. if you can learn to not think and just feel in your dreams, you can maintain consciousness.

now: step two to successful star-watching is to not be concerned about the noise in the environment, whether it's inside of your body or outside of it. same as a drug experience, you want to maintain calm and not overthink things[^1], because it's just environmental noise, and so you should find a perception which allows a feeling of calm and relaxation instead.

finally, after slowing down the important topics, and then not letting the environmental noise pull me out of the relaxed dream-like state, I often times feel a sensation like something breaks, like I'm free-falling, after I've breached a threshold. it's important in all of this to not be at all worried about it.

here's the real bit now: sometimes I find it difficult to get to the vision upgrade because I'm trying so hard. I keep looking at the light/star and put it into my eye, but I keep forgetting to relax because things keep popping into my head[^3]. after I'm relaxed, when looking at the light/star, I will begin to drift into a thoughtless state where things all begin to happen automatically. this is when the vision upgrades start to happen rapidly one right after another, and as long as I maintain that thoughtless state, even if there's a bunch of noise in my head or environment, if I just feeling the feeling that my source feels in that relaxed state, then it just keeps going one after another[^4]

often times what happens is I find myself working so hard to try and get the vision upgrade that I find myself efforting it -- or, I find that I started out with some preconceived expectaions of how many or how quick and that's blocking me there too becsuse I'm too logically (numerical/analytical) focused to be any good at it. I have to get to feeling it, so often times I just tell myself it's not going to happen and I'm not going to worry about getting the upgrades, and I'm just going to enjoy clearing my mind, releasing my effort and focusing on the star/light for some period of time (meditating) -- but I always know that if I do that, then the vision upgrades always come -- so I relax into it and it comes. the important part was to *give up on my expectations* and allow it to happen[^5].

---

sorry for all the off-topic stuff there. let's take all of these different things and apply them to the present situation. I don't feel pessimism at all. my stance is that I'm willing to go as long as nosebook is capable of holding me because it'll be the most energetic. also, if I try to make it happen, it won't happen. I can't do something I don't feel, so for me it's all about what I feel. the steps I described up there are all part of the process. it doesn't matter that there's a whole bunch of noisy and deceptive people telling me all sorts of things. it doesn't matter if I have a frustrated looking reaction (or have people arguing in my mind while relaxing), because it's just noise in the bacground. I'm getting more and more close to feeling like my inner being feels -- which isn't in pessimism.

I'm basically doing this whole thing from a step-5 perspective. I don't really feel pessimism. I just think it's a great game to play where I just go along with what they think they want, but because they're looking (and feeling) in the direction of unwanted, trying to avoid a horrible catastrophe they're going to get, whenever it happens, a manifestation about the way they feel. I'm just certain that anything that anything other than that would be more resistant and difficult to experience the result of (like the star-watching). it's all good. let's see how long they can give their attention to unwanted for :)

[1]: on drugs, this gives paranoia. when sober, you never experience paranoia in these experinces, because you immediately wake up. when on drugs, your brain is forced into that form of less-resistant state, and if you're not there emotionally as well, it can cause paranoia more rapidly, because your body wants to feel bad, but the drug won't let you, so you start to freak out because it feels like something is off, and it is -- your perception is how you feel about stuff, so when you can't feel like how you're used to feeling about something[^2], you get a bad trip

[2]: you can also get used (addicted) to the way things feel on the drug, so when things don't feel like the way they usually feel to you on the drug, then you have to get the drug, because undrugged reality is now giving a bad trip. it's just whatever you're used to.

[3]: this happens because the star activates DMT in your brain and the increase in DMT amplifies your feelings so they feel more real. ever notice how in dream state things feel really real? it's because they're so amplified, they feel like your physical senses, and not small and soft like a thought or a light emotion. since the DMT amplifies how you feel, if you feel bad, you'll start getting powerfully bad thoughts. all you have to do is to let them go and then you should be able to relax enough.

[4]: I am convinced that this is how female orgasm feels like... or at least it's how it *should* feel like anyway. it's very very interesting to me how similar star-watching is to the female orgasm. I really want to teach the girls at least how to star-watch because it's the ability to be aware of the body/thought connection without the (pleasure) sex to distract you from that self/body connection.

[5]: in @[abe-now](2020-10-31 p2) there was a woman asking about her golf coach, saying that her coach said to tell her to let go of her own expectations. this is exactly what I have to do, but I have to give up on my own (or others') expectations to perform a certain way[^6] and focus on the relaxed feeling that my source feels (instead of the expectation to perform), and then when I do that, and when I feel that way, I know that I always get a vision upgrade. I can pretty much call it a few seconds before it happens now, but if I call it, I lose focus, so I can say it's coming soon in like 5-15 seconds or so, but I have to let it happen. if I think of it, I lose it[^4].

[6]: it does happen that nosebook practises certain responses in my dream state, so that I will expect those things to happen. even though it's the "expected" way for me to perform, I don't have to conform to their expectations of me. when star-watching, I notice this often, which is why I'm willing to talk about this as a really good example of others' expectations for me. it could even be even as general as society's expectations on a person, a stereotype like "girls are dumb and stupid" -- or even a parent or significant other's opinions, which to some degree these ideas are belived to be true, but they hinder you mentally. these expectations are precisely the resistance that I practise a new perception on, and then when they come up, I let go of those antiquated ideas by reinforcing (practising) the new perception. I've found I can't just delete something from my beliefs. instead, I have to replace it with something -- usually something I can feel is an improvement. I want to write about this more, and I will soon

#### (25:14) - logic & reactions

hmmm, some interesting reactions to what I just wrote. I have a feeling this next section on logic will help things to understand a bit better, but I will begin with this... the reaction was, how can I be "acting" like it doesn't matter to me if I don't ever get the manifestation.

... cause it's not an act. I really don't have an opinion either way on the subject. like I've mentioned more than a few times, I've made the feeling the manifestation. the physical condition (or manifestation) is what slows you down, because as soon as you see it and observe it, if it has more wanted than unwanted, then it doesn't create nearly as much new desire as it does if it's almost all or mostly unwanted. the more unwanted it is, the more desire it creates, and so therefore the more energetic it is.

in fact, on friday (the 13th), I was thinking about this idea a whole lot. I figure that if nosebook wants to make this a reality they can tolerate, what they need to do is to figure out a way to turn this into the most wanted thing for them -- or, said another way, they need to figure out how to make it the most unwanted for us as possible. they have limits to how terrible things can be, but if they do that, then it'll be most beneficial for them, and we'll bounce around a whole long while and again be delayed the desirable manifestation for as long as possible, but in the process, we're going to learn to feel the way we want to feel, even without a perfect manifestation. I figure they can get the most benefit and we can get a whole lot of practise on feeling the way we want to feel.

so how does this all fit together? I really am totally on board for getting the most energetic manifestation possible[^1], and if the manifestation is something that would slow me down, I'm sure that is not the path that will be taken. I'm pretty certain that the manifestation cannot be 100% ideal because it will need to keep speeding me up. additionally, there's no way that nosebook could ever allow us to have an ideal manifestation because it would show how ridiculously fragile their setup really is. their con-game is important to the bigger picture because they have to ensure that no one is getting improved perception. meanwhile, things are going to start getting really energetic really quickly (I mean like way faster than before), and the earth itself will begin to produce an environment that will cause everyone's thoughts and feelings to become much more amplified to begin the separation process[^2].


[1]: it really doesn't matter to me this subject of being taken advantage of or disadvantaged to ensure some fragile people don't see their carefully setup charade disintegrate. the thing is that

[2]: velikovski writes about this with the 7-day period of intense light and enlightenment immediately prior to the deluge. while some people received incredible insight, for others, it seemed that this was causing tremendous turmoil. this same event recorded in some cultures as a tremendous enlighenting experience, was also told by plato to be the time when the athenians defeated the atlantian army. so, while for some it was very enlightening[^3] others realised their worst fears.

[3]: I have to wonder, because ramtha talks about this great battle during the time of atlantis, where he was fighting and he fought and fought killing more and more people until he transcended his human from (or something like that). I can imagine that if all of a sudden the earth emits an energy causing everyone's brains to begin releasing tons of DMT, people's thoughts would all become super amplified, and the peoples' brains who are improvement oriented would transcend reality, while the others who were not improvement oriented would experience all of their worst fears become reality as their bad feeling gets amplified really rapidly and the planet, essentially sheds its physical skin, becoming a purely mental creation (shedding those not compatible with the new mental creation's energy levels[^4]).

[4]: omg, maybe I should write about this, cause I was seeing as I wrote it, the planet (who, like us, isn't this physical body), sheds it's physical body, leaving it behind as it goes into a new plane of existence (5th dimension?) where everything it now appears to be is a mental/emotional creation. ok, so the shell it leaves behind is just a "corpse" right (not a living entity)? well, then I had the thing that I often times wondered where it came from, but when I was younger I developed the idea that when jesus died, he literally transcended his body and went into the earth and then became a part of the planet, almost like he took over the vacated planetary corpse that was left over from a previous shedding of skin. I don't know what any of that means, but it was interesting to me to think of the idea of inhabiting a planetary body. really weird concept. I wouldn't worry (lol) too much about it...

### 2020-11-25 23:08 - (2020-11-14 p1)

#### 42:00 - the grid

I keep wanting to talk about this because I have often times got reactions on what I mean by layer 3, "structure" or "logic" -- because it seems to people that they seem a bit nebulous. the reaction increased when I used the term in @[noseblog](2020-11-15 07:06) "inellectual willpower" -- as something that would be contradictory, or split-energy of another new description of desire which I wrote as "elmotional willpower". people seemed to understand the desire as emotional willpower, but they didn't really understand as much the intellectual willpower idea in the same way.

I seem to experiece this perhaps a bit differently than others, or perhaps I'm more aware of it -- but I almost always experience the destination of a problem as a feeling, then have to find out how to get there with logic. for me logic is like the path, and the destination is a feeling -- but never a full feeling. it develops, or perhaps the picture becomes clearer the closer I get to the solution, and the closer I get to the solution or the realisation, then the more I feel it. in fact, quite often for me it feels like I'm *remembering* the solution, almost as if I'm just finding the way in my mind to remember it. sometimes it feels like a process of discovery to me, as if I'm discovering the road as I travel it or something, but I generally feel like I'm remebering things and it's almost as if it's getting more and more familiar to me, until I finally remember it.

the feeling of remembering is quite an interesting sensation to me because I often have experienced "non-physical" as this kind of "structure" or "grid" -- perhaps you could say "network" or "graph" of different nodes which are all in relation to each other and all experience motion toward or away from each other. I have often times wanted to figure out how to program this experience of non-physical as program, but it would be unbelievably slow and impractical for a general purpose processor to simulate. I don't really know how I could possibly do it very easily, other than with a real physical thing, with suspended vibrating particles, which I could individually read the locations of, do queries on similar particles (either vibrational similarity or physical 3d spatial proximity), so I just don't know how I can do this. I've often times wanted to make this model in my imagination, because then it'd be infinitely easier to do these queries, add more particles, reprogram the particles, etc. than a real-life physical model would be able to do...

anyway, imagine each of those particles as like a vibrational reality, and each time you experience something, each experience sends a pulse into each of the particles. the longer the pulse, and the more harmonic the pulse is to the particle, the stronger that particle will begin to vibrate in that way. obviously, if you don't "ping" the particle for a while, its vibration will gradually dissipate into near dormacy (though remaining in the same vibrational "position"). the things that you observe frequently will become stronger and stronger.

I guess all of the particles would be kind of like little programmable magnets or inductors or maybe tiny RLC circuits. I didn't think about their implementation, but they continue to float in vibrational proximity to other things. another thing I hadn't considered is that the "spatial" relationship shouldn't be restricted to 3d. it should be many more dimensions than that -- so mabye like a bunch of really tiny RLC circuits with the the R able to be programmed, and a resonating setup which can send impulses into the grid, getting all of these many RLC circuits to begin to receive more energy or not. each of the circuits should be powered with only enough energy for the RLC to continue to operate at a basically idle level (not strong enough to show up on any queries, but still going such than an impulse can reactivate it).

---

anyway, the concept is that these circuits are like vibraational realities, and you attract them with your focus. the more you focus or observe something the more it activates and begins to get other circuits to begin to resonate similarly. now you could imagine the "graph" part of this. with each node being close to each other, these are like hops from one thought reality to another, so if you want to go from node x to node y, you just have to find suitable hops between the two. because they're vibrational nodes, the query is easy. you look at the vibrational similarity -- or the closeness of one node to another. all nodes are affecting each other at once, meaning that thoughts are constantly becoming more similar to the environmental simulus and to other thoughts, while at the same time other thoughts are constantly becoming more distant (vibrationally).

now, it isn't hard to begin to look at these nodes as a simile to "time travel" -- where each node is in a sense your "next logical step" based on your simulus, and the trajectory can be simulated and anticipated (given the predicted stimulus). it also isn't hard to see that each of these nodes is kinda similar to an emotional position in space-time, and when you are resonant with the node, your reality should contain the corresponding (inverse relation) simulus. eg. the feedback mechanism is simple: node (emotional state) + stimulus = next logical steps. or pick any node (emotional state) in space, and the corresponding simulus should arrive as its resonant nodes. each stimulus is essentially a feeling or emotion anyway (some more gross/physical than others).

I haven't really brought out this idea because it's really rough at the moment. I would need to do a lot of experiments on it to begin to get it to work properly, but with a little bit of effort, I think physcal stimulus and emotional state can easily be made corresponding, and effort can go easily into "predicting" undesirable states, and invoking simulus to navigate around them.

you could learn to use your built in emotional guidance system, but if you insist on not wanting to do that, or attempting to replace others' emotional guidance system with this one, this may be a way that you could affect "inellectual willpower" by controlling physical simulus. lol :) anyway, good luck...

#### (51:14) - competition of feeling the best

one of the interesting reactions that I had to my conversation with dominique was that I seemed to prefer being right around the middle of the emotional scale. in fact, if you watch my behaviour quite frequently, I often offset a good feeling emotion with a not as good feeling one, or I go out of my way to kind of say something offensive or something that reduces the good feeling down to a more average one.

it's just that I prefer that I continue to gain momentum, and not try to feel the "best" or the "worst". it's much easier to navigate at the middle of the scale, because if I want to feel slightly better, I can do that easy, and if I want to feel worse, I can do that easier too. the crazy thing is, as I go, there are less and less things that make me feel worse now, and I just keep going faster and faster, that I'm gaining more and more control over it.

I suppose that at any moment that I want to, I could "pull the trigger" and do something that would push me over the top, but I find it unnecessary to do that. it's not necessary to try and be at the best feeling place because there's a lot of "danger" in feeling better than I have experience feeling. in other words, there's a bit of danger in driving faster than you feel comfortable driving, right -- so until I'm pretty well comfortable with mindblowing speeds, I'm in no hurry to try and go faster than I feel comfortable.

this subject is probably a controversial one, and I don't even know the right answer to it. I'm kind of putting it out there because I want some feedback on it. I have two seemingly contradictory thoughts:

1. feeling better than I (or others around me) feel has often times lead to difficulty. this is most easily noticable when I have some sort of drug, which allows me to feel considerably better. for example, doing coke, I've noticed that it was more difficult for me to tell when something was going wrong, because I artificially felt better than I had practised. or, conversely, if I smoke weed, I think the drug allows me to feel probably closer to how I really feel, which is pretty amazing. however the difficulty then becomes that it's really difficult for me to be around people. they don't like to be around someone who feels like I do, and when I start talking about anything that's not superficial, I tend to go wayyyy out further than is probably necessary. therefore, I choose to purposefully not feel my best at all times, instead preferring to remain as close to no strong emotion as possible. if I feel any variation, I can rapidly adjust, which allows me the flexibility to be in any situation that I want, and navigate any way I choose.

2. if it feels good, it is good. therefore, the better it feels, the closer it is to my inner being that it is.

it feels to me like I'm fine with the staying as close to zero as I can get, because I keep gaining more and more control as I go along. I don't know if that's part of the whole "need not the manifestation" part, because I've noticed that the longer that I remain like this, the faster I'm going. I can't possibly imagine how much faster it will be before a manifestation *will* happen. I'm gaining such a good capacity now to be able to sense slight variations in how I feel, that navigation is becoming really really easy now. I don't want to make everyone wait for a long time as I just keep going faster and faster, however it feels like that's what is going to happen.

I don't really mind it, because I know that there are two major factors here:

first, I'm a good example for people in an unconditional state demonstrating belief in myself instead of the conditions (@[noseblog](2020-11-22 16:49)). I said (paraphase):

```
it is evident to me that virtually every observer will begin to believe that the girls are necessary conditions for many unbelivable manifestations. this is good for nosebook because they can use our manifestation to keep people believing that they need extraordinary physical conditions instead of learning to believe in theirselves.
```

the second major factor is that I really like the idea of continuing on going faster and faster and gaining more and more control over my experience. right nor, I feel like the girls are really going to make that perhaps a lot more difficult. obviously that will change as I get better and better at it, so I'm clearly not ready still. therefore the only way that I could possibly want the manifestation more than my present circumstances is if the manifestation would cause me go to steadily (not like the "contradictory thoughts" expressed above) faster. I'm simply not interested in going faster than I feel comfortable, and neither am I interested in a manifestation that will slow me down, either.

why do I want this? I'll show you when I get there :) you'll have to wait and see... it's gonna be for reals, mind blowing. I guess the third aspect is that there was a previous section where abe was talking about how the people who bring you the most contrast are the ones that bring your most expansion, and that when you get the hang of it, you'll actually be very appreciative of them.

appreciate is a funny word, because it means "to become more" -- and so you would wonder why in the world would I want *more* of mr. motor? well, it's true that he is absolutely responsible for my greatest expansion. no question about it. I'm still hanging on to that idea that I've talked about a few times, the "paradox" of the momentary expansion overtaking the expansion of the manifestation itself (because the manifestation itself requires physical space to occupy it), so if it can remain energetic, then it can become so much more. I really want to do that, and so there's quite a bit of me that's holding out to the possibility that nosebook could find a way to hold me, essentially indefinitely. it sounds maybe a bit tragic at the moment, but like I said, the momentary expansion would become so great that it would far surpass any physical capability.

I have this feeling that they're simply not capable of doing it. they have way too many limiting beliefs and are too slow. I think to effectively do this, I would need to have machines that are capable of desire, program their desire to hold me energetically, and then they could, essentially go with virtually zero resistance toward their desire effortlessly. I would become so energetic, it would *literally* be out of this world. I have no capability to imagine what it may be like or what might come of it. it's too big, but from the perspective where I stand now, it appears so simple; I just go faster and faster. it's so easy. I'm completely unstoppable[^1] and this reality seems inevitable actually.

[1]: by myself unstoppable. I am absolutely 100% without a doubt certain that I could/will accomplish this. what I am not certain about though is if I could do it along with the girls.

#### (26:24) - creation box

as they were talking about the creation box, I was realising that the list of girls that I'm inviting to join is kind of like that creation box. I just put them in the box (not literally), and then the thoughts eventually turn to things -- and like they mentioned last week, esther when she looked back through her creation box noticed that so many of the things she put in there were now manifest in her reality.

they mentiioned looking through the box on a regular basis. perhaps I want to go back through the list sometimes a little more frequently. I get kind of scared thinking about that idea though because my memory is so bad these days, I almost certainly won't be able to remember how any of them looked, and sometimes when I try to remember how some people looked, I have no idea what shows up in my imagination -- and sometimes I get really weird reactions on what I presume to be the image that shows up. it bothers me a lot and I don't like to try and remember because I really can't remember how people look and actually most of them I don't even know how they look.. I really don't want to remmember some of them wrong.

like for example, I am remembering a girl that I saw a long time ago in colorado springs. she was walking along and I looked at her and it seemed very obvious to her that I had looked at her. I had the sense that people knew when I was looking at them when I would see people react all the way across the street at vera's house, but now seeing her reaction I had positive evidence that this was the case. in the moment she seemed either obviously embarrassed or somthing didn't feel right for her based on her reaction. however later her feeling began to soften and I eventually felt as if I wanted to invite her to join (I don't think I wrote that one down). anyway, I doubt the image in my mind of her is a "good" one, as I can only remeber her kind of recoiling in discomfort, so I really don't know what that image may look like, for example. as I'm typing this, she feels really good to me, so I know she feels great, but I don't know what the image would look like. I'm mainly concerned because I don't want to conjure bad or embarrassing(?) images of any of them, because that's not how I "see" (feel) any of them now. they all feel pretty good, otherwise it would be apparent.

I just now tried looking back at the list @[a-list](2020-09-20 18:41), to see if I could remmember the oldest entry and not only could I remember all of them there, but additionally, without even having read that entry recently, I've even thought about all of those mentiened there at least once recently, and many of them more than just once. hmm.

I'll probably go and revisit more often it then. seems like a good idea.

### 2020-12-01 01:20 - (2020-11-21 p1)

#### 15:04 - regret

last time, in @[abe-now](2020-11-14 p1 42:00), I was talking about the grid, and in that one I gave quite a lengthy example about a technical idea I had, and this applies to that as well, however this time I won't be talking so tecnically.

if you imagine situations as a point in space. each of them feel a certain way, this is pre-manifestational thinking. so if your present moment feels one way, then that is exactly your position in space. that's how you feel, and there are a whole lot of nearby situations in space which are nearby, because they feel similar.

as you travel through time, you're essentially going from one of these points to another one of these points. your memories are also these points in space, too. also you should imagine your desired reality as a point out there in space, as well. between you and it, there is a gap, and there are often times not a whole lot of points that are similar to your desired reality. most times, it's pretty far out there ahead of you. however, let's say that you observe something that is more similar to your desired reality, let's say it's halfway between you and your desired reality, so it's closer. having seen it for yourself, you can now imagine this reality much easier and it appears like there is also a gap between you and that reality too.

there really isn't a gap though. you just can't see the path to get there. you can't see all of the points that you will pass on your way to that desired reality, because they're not "reality" yet. each of those points have a feeling associated to them, so as you move through time, there is a time-series created of feelings that you have passed through. we call this time. time is just the sequence of feelings, and when you move to another point in time, you're just adjusting your frequency, or the way you feel.

the important thing to note here is that this time-series creates a sort of trajectory and a momentum. the faster it's going, the faster it goes, and the slower it goes the slower it goes. your whole life is this trajectory. the important thing to note is that your memories are *feelings*, so that means they are relative to your perception. you may have a difficult time rememebering things that happened when you had a different form of perception (like you were a kid or in a very different place emotionally).

so this is where regret comes in. imagine that there was something that you really wanted, but you regret that you missed it, well no problem because that regret is just a point in time (in the past) where you felt differently than you do now. obviously you don't feel that way now, otherwise that would be your present reality. therefore, when you conjure the idea that makes you feel regret, then you are essentially tuning yourself *back* to how you felt *then* and that's the majority of why it feels so bad.

let's say your desired reality is in some location and the regret is waaaayyy back in the opposite direction. when you go to feel that regret, the reason why it feels bad is because you're tuning to that past point in time. that point (in time) is much further away from feeling like your desired reality feels like, than you are feeling right now. in other words, if you felt like your desired reality feels right now, you would be experiencing it, right now. the closer you get to that desired reality you get, the more like it you will feel (which is usually better than how you feel now). seems obvious right?

well, here's the great thing about the momentum the time-series creates. if you have a lot of things in your past which you have regret or don't feel good about them, then as you adjust your perception of those points in time -- that is the way you feel about them now, the less they will "weigh you down" or the less you will feel held back by them.

in @[noseblog](2020-11-29 01:48), I was talking about the two (really three) different ways that you feel. the first is how you physically feel in the moment (this is relative; like blueshift), and the second is how you perceptually feel. I want to integrate that idea in a bit here. as you are moving closer to your desired reality, the better you will feel. this feeling is relative to you and your desire, so as you approach it, you feel better. this is why drugs and sex and stuff feel so good because often times you release reasistance in the moment, and that carries you toward your desired reality (which isn't bound up in the resistance of the present). this sends you shooting off in the direction of your desired reality really quickly and you feel really good. this is also quite a bit manipulatable by physical conditions as well. you can physically feel much better or worse than you really feel.

you can also feel much better or worse than how you perceptually feel. as you use your senses, you observe things and experience them and that creates a feeling based on your perception or preference (these two are very similar). so, for example if your perception/preference is that apples are to be crunchy and you have a mushy apple, you may experience some negative emotion if that's something that's really important to you. however, if apple crunchiness is not that important to you (preference) or let's say you have a perception that all apples should be genetically modified to perfection so that you should never have any mushy apples (percuption), then you may experience a different feeling response to the situation.

so let's say that you had an experience that you really had some regrets on. I'll use myself as an example here. a long time ago, I somehow got convinced that I should make raquel responsible for how I feel. when she did things that made me feel good, I loved her, and when she did things that didn't make me feel good, I was angry with her. I deeply regretted this. you cannot imagine how terrible it felt for me to even to realise or admit that is what I had done[^1].

as I went back and changed my perception around this, it liberated me quite a bit. first, I didn't want raquel to be responsible for how I feel, so I didn't need her to do things anymore for me to feel good. in the same way, she wasn't responsible for me feeling bad either. there were a number of other situations where she wanted me to feel bad for something I had done or not done. the idea of relating someone else's action (or non-action) to a feeling is totally the bogus part here that I'm trying to illustrate. if I do something than I feel bad about it later, this is regret. if someone scolds for something I've done, and I feel bad because of their scolding, then this is very similar, but I don't know the word for it.

decoupling action and feeling is the key to gaining that liberation. other people's actions don't need to make me feel bad and neither do my own. in fact, if either of them feel bad, then there's always a way to improve the perception on the thing so it no longer feels bad anymore.

however it's done.. whether you find a way to improve your perception or you work your way up the emotional scale on that subject doesn't matter -- the point is that you find a way to feel better about that point in time in the past. when you do, that position in the past will literally move because you have yourself moved your perception of it now. so let's say it was waaayyy back away from your desired reality, and now your new perception of it makes it feel much more closer to your desired reality than before[^2] and what happens is, your entire timeline moves forward. not instantly... it takes a little bit of time to propogate, but that experience will feel better, and the ones after it will feel better too, and they won't amount to monumental changes in the moment, but now that you have less resistance in your perecption (the past will do that), you will move forward more rapidly.

this is essentially a lot of what I've done, and why I'm progressing so rapidly. I have a whole lot of things in the past that I have released and am releasing which are allowing that energy to flow much more unrestricted. by nature you are being pulled toward your desired reality at least as rapidly as your generating desires. on each subject, you're getting further away if you're adding more resistance and moving closer as you release resistance. so, if you change your perception of how things happened in past moments of time you can make tremendous progress rapidly because it cascades[^3].

---

so here's the thing about regret. it sounds completely sociopathic, but especially this subject: you simply have to disregard all common sense on this. let's say you did something horrible. you have to find a way to feel at least ok about it. it can also help to invoke a bit of disassociative disorder to get around it (I do this all the time). imagine that this horrible thing that you did, was not yourself but someone else. how do you feel about it then? if it involved someone you love, then try to imagine they are someone else too -- strangers you don't have any relation with. often times it can help to see it this way. additionally, you have the advantage of knowing that they *ARE* different people. that was you then, and this is you now. well, ok if you still perceive like that person back then perceived things, then they are the same people. however, if you perceive things differently, I would argue that they are indeed different people and should be perceived as such: that action/behaviour was something that someone that perceives like that would do.

for the case of regret like a missed opportunity, then just imagine what it was back then which which prevented you from moving toward your desired reality -- and just feel that. like imagine that you could say, ok, well I didn't perceive myself as someone worthy enough to experience such a thing, or maybe I wasn't beautiful enough or smart enough or whatever. those are the things that you can start to change your perception (or work your way up the emotional scale) on now. then, in the same way that common sense should be disregarded regarding disassociation or finding a way to feel good about something labeled as horrible one should also not attempt to limit oneself to that exact opportunity or whatever. your reality will reflect how you feel so feel like desired reality feels so that you experience it. regret can only hold you back from feeling that way. nothing to regret. regret only means you want that deaired reality more but aren't letting yourself (for whatever reason) feel that way yet.

---

the last and most important thing I want to say, and the reson why I started writing this is that regret feels like you can't change somethting in the past. however, what I said above was entirely to explain that if instead of changing the past, you change how you perceive or feel about the past, you literally change the past because they're just points in emotional space, and "time" is just the traversal through those points.

[1]: some of you don't feel very convinced. I'll give up an example that's on tape somewhere. I had wanted to get bikes to move around the alcobendas area and stuff, but for whatever reaon it never happened. when I went to visit her in barcelona, she had a bike, and this made me very angry because I wanted her to figure out the bike thing when we were together, not wait until she'd left me to figure out the bike thing. obviously it doesn't feel like any big deal now, but it was back then. look at the tape. this is also evidence of what I'm about to write next.

[2]: things like -- "well, that was the best I could do at the time", or "I'm glad that I had that experience cause I'm so much clearer now that's not what I want to be like/feeling/experiencing/etc."

[3]: these are perception changes. working your way up the emotional scale is similar (cause you need to find new ways to perceive the same thing to feel differently about it) and also complementary. working your way up the emotional scale results in a change in perception through practise. changing perception directly is more like theory, and then requires a lot of practise to perfect it. this is where the cascade comes in, because they don't take effect until that perception is practised into reality for you.

#### (35:28) - doing the emotional scale work

it really works. when they said that I had the idea to maybe begin doing the emotional scale so that other people can see me do it, sort of so it becomes a thing. I can do it without the scale, and I do it by changing my perception on stuff, so it's easy for me. however, I do know there is tremendous benefit in it, and I'm pretty sure it'll be beneficial to me.

the idea that's kinda coming to mind is that instead of writing a huge thing in noseblog which is kinda ironic and situational, what I can do is reformat it a little bit so that I show instead of the thought process, but more the emotional process, outlining the change in perception and the steps upward. I'll ponder the idea a bit and see what I come up with. especially in light of what I just wrote, I think I could find a clever way to do it.

we'll see...

#### (1:00:44) - non-physical non-resistant relationships

after they were talking about this, I was thinking about how all relationships are eternal, as in there is vibrational similarities between everyone, and there is separation between us appearing in the form of human bodies, but we all are pretty similar. like just imagine that all humans share like 99.9% the same DNA, so from that perspective we're all really similar, with some differences in vibration between environments and stuff right, so at the basis we're all pretty similar.

I was thinking about the creation box and I think I may want to just go ahead and include everyone in there that I felt anything from. the non-physical relationship is eternal anyway, and while in the physical there may be some amount of separation, there are more than certainly a lot of other realities (or timelines) where we are physically together.

I'm not quite sure why I want to do this, but since my goal is to obtain a source-like perception, almost certainly I would really enjoy to feel the non-resistant version of all of these different relationships as well.

#### (19:45) - well I know what I don't want process

as the person was asking the question for a "NEW process to perceive our vortices" -- I didn't hear the word perceive. instead, I heard the word "see", and it kind of bothered me because I can't imagine why you would want to "see" your vortex. I responded to the screen, "why! why not just feel it?". they give the process of every time that you identify something unwanted, to really notice it and to say, "I know what I don't want"

they have often times said in the past that "when you know what you don't want, you know what you do want" -- and they've also said, "no one can accurately identify all the contents and nuances of their vortex" (paraphrase). so as they were really emphasising the part of really noticing "*that* is what I *don't* want", I understood this. when you feel the unwanted part, remember that anything that vibrates goes both directions, so it contains both unwanted and wanted parts. when you really notice and can feel that is what you *don't* want, for the same reason that a pendulum swings both directions, at the very same time (really a fraction of a second later) as knowing what you don't want, you do know what you do want. it's just that your perception is "out of phase" to that knowing. so like if it's a swing or a pendulum, then you're noticing when the swing is going away from you instead of when it's coming toward you. the swing makes both motitions, so every time the swing goes away from you, it must return back. or, perhaps in any wave, the magnitude of the wave at any moment can either be positive or negative, depending at when you look at it.

so, let's bring this back. you don't need to do their process to become more aware of how the events which you would say "that's what I don't want" make you feel, but it helps. as I've gotten better and better at this, I don't really need to work so much up the emotional scale anymore because wmen I feel something, I can invert the signal, and instead of feeling what I don't want, feel what I do want -- obviously not in it's entirety, but these sorts of transformations become easier and easier once you get good at noticing how different things feel. sometimes I have difficulty expressing in words what the inversion of the feeling is, but it definitely works.

I'm just going to pre-rate their process five stars, by saying that if you do that, you *will* begin to perceive with more and more clarity what your vortex is.

let me reiterate: whenever you feel what it is that you *don't* want, immediately afterward, you also feel what it is that you *do* want. unfortunately, however, you're just not quite able to perceive it yet because you're often times still observing the problem. however, if you know that as soon as you know what you don't want (ie. the negative portion of the sine wave), you then immediately know what it is you do want (ie. the positive portion of the sine wave), then you can begin to perceive it more and more rapidly. practising feeling what you don't want enough and sooner or later, you'll be able to feel both, and then feel the confidence to jump into any unwanted situation without fear.

weird resonance: right before this, I just watched a thijs video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pTzLHDUiHg)) where he knew what he didn't want.

#### (28:10) - I know what I don't want

as they're talking, for example they just used the example of "if you feel overwhelmed, you want some relief or you want a nap" -- I was getting a bit bothered by their words there. maybe I don't translate it into action like this so rapidly, because if I'm overwhelmed, then right afterward, I feel a very very very sense of ease, but it's not at all a real thing yet. often times in that situation, I throw up my hands and leave the situation because staying there I won't be able to find that feeling of ease. it's never an exact method, but as soon as I start moving in the direction of what I do want, then thoughts start coming to my head to go in that direction.

a funny reaction just happened because people were noting that I don't always just pivot right toward what I do want... or so they think. however, and perhaps I'm a bit of a troublemaker for this, but it's often the case that I don't want to immediately go in the opposite direction. often times I *want* to feel worse. feeling worse isn't a problem at all. you get to decide how much you want to do any of it. good feeling emotions != good and bad feeling emotions != bad. they're both just emotions. when you get the hang of it, you'll begin to understand why it's fun to be a bit of a troublemaker... if you feel negative emotion and it's OK for you, or maybe you even feel contentment or satisfaction with that negative emotion, then it's just fine. that's kind of like how I would describe being really good at step 5. the emotion is there, and it exists, but it doesn't bother you in any significant way.

now, to totally derail the original idea, the reaction that came just now was about the case of drugs: like, what if you're on drugs and something really terrible is happening and you feel sort of like really OK with whatever it is. well, in that moment while you're on the drugs, you have non-resistance to the thing, so it's not a problem. it's only a problem when you're not on the drugs. so, if the drug goes away, it could be a problem, and the common thing to do is to become very conditional and ensure one has access to the drug. this happens often, and is why drug users begin to feel like the drug is necessary for basic functioning. like I said numerous times before, this sort of situation is a good way to begin to practise a new form of perception -- and whether you like it or not, the non-resistant response you practise on the drug will make you more likely to make the decision to have the same response to the negative emotion sober, as you did on the drug.

---

ok so going back now to the original idea, what I was noticing is that abraham was offering a lot of action ideas to "I know what I do want" when for me it's not an action at all. I go to find the opposite feeling (ease in this case instead of overwhelment), and then action ideas begin to take shape. I'll leave it to the reader to ponder how that same technique of not taking action right away to solution the opposite feeing, instead just feeling the feeling -- may, in fact, make me want to feel worse.

#### (48:00) - physical expanding non-physical by "taking thought beyond what it has been before"

in @[noseblog](2020-12-03 09:11), I made a connection that I felt a lot of people's "aha!" to, when I was talking about non-resistance from a source-like perspective... I'll recap. in the entry, I mentioned that I would be so non-resistant, that I would be pretty easily directed by either nosebook or the girl(s). I felt some wondering why, so I responded by saying that from a source-like perspective, *all* of the inifite possibilities of yourself exist. every single one of them -- both the ones where I'm completely allowing of what the girl wants to do, or completely allowing of what nosebook wants to do -- and everything inbetween. the "kenny" consciousness that sees through these two eyes is down here in "reality", navigating all of these possible timelines by the way he feels -- just like all of us -- however, he's not me. there are always infinite other versions of me, and everyone of us is having a mulitple bodied experience, just we're not conscious of it. the consciousness stream that you think of as yourself is most certainly present in many other bodies at the same time. there exactly as many yous as there are the resonant versions of you that people are attracting into their experience. in fact, you could perceive yourself as a gradient of all of the posssibile forms that you can exist in at once.

so if, from a source perspective, which you don't usually get until you die, you are *all* of those possible yous, how can that be possible? the reason is, from a source perspective you don't have any "resistance" to those other forms. imagine yourself in a totally different set of circumstances, where those circumstances summon a very different version of you, say a murderer or a rapist or something. those versions exist in a vibrational form, either as outdated versions of you, or as potential futures, but they're not you in the present moment[^2] -- and none of those other possibilities of you are perceived in a negative way either. I like to think of them kind of like actors playing different roles. the resistance I feel from people around this idea is the definition of "you" as these other versions. this is why in the new identity layer, these are diffrent identities, more like actors, and you can move around between these different versions of "yourself" based on how you feel. I think it helps a lot for people to perceive them as separated identities, but this is only a cosmetic effect; the reality is *everyone* has a source -- even the murderers and rapists. the only thing really that separates you from them, is how you feel vs. how they feel.

actors can easily understand this, because if you feel diffrently than you normally do, you can be a different person. to "get into character" you have to feel like that character does. you can choose to be whoever you want to act like, and again, this isn't perceived as a bad thing; it's just a character behaving in accordance to the way they feel.

if we think of a role as an emotional state, then you can imagine that given a certain emotional state or role, the actor should behave in accordance with it, and never should the actor should be percevived negatively for playing a negative role. from a non-physical standpoint, no roles/emotions are better than any others. instead, they're all just a part of the story (or the process) culminating in the present moment. the present moment is always an improvment on the previous (even if it doesn't appear that way physically), so source doesn't ever look back at those outdated forms. even if those improvements are only in potentiality (ie. unrealised timelines), it's still an improvement, so there is never any judgement on any character which brought that improvement.

additionally, it's worth noting that in physicality, you can try to go back to an outdated version of yourself which feels terrible. however, you are never the same you that you were back then, so now, what happens is it just creates another new stronger attraction to a better-feeling version of you. this keeps accumulating until you cannot go

the infinite possibilities of you that exists, also exists on the positive side too: meaning, that there are many other versions of you that feel WAY better than you do now. from source's perspective, all of these other better-feeling versions of you are cumulatively pulling you more and more strongly toward your more desired (better feeling) reality. likewise, and the reason why abraham calls it "pure positive energy", all of the worse-feeling (outdated) versions of you that exist are the reason why the better-feeling versions of you exist in the first place. it's easy to see now why it's "pure positive energy", because every thing is perceived as an improvement/expansion to the previous version. for every better-feeling version of yourself, there are an uncountable number of worse-feeling (outdated) versions that preceeded it.

therfore, if every possible version of you exists, how is there any expansion? the way there is expansion is to make new versions of yourself which are improvements. how will you do that? you have to realise something that you don't like, or better said: realise an improvement to a version of yourself. this instantly creates a better-feeling version, and now there are more versions of you. you have expanded. this is why "contrast" is so important, and why I think that process is so great. realising that any worse-feeling version of yourself will amplify the better-feeling versions of you, calls you stronger toward the better feeling versions every time.

every time that you realise what you don't want, that's what creates the expansion of other versions of you that already right now in this present moment feel better than you do right now. you can choose to feel that way, or not. you can force yourself to feel as terrible as possible for as long as possible until your vortex is pulling you so hard toward it you have no choice to go toward it -- or you could experience it now. the harder it pulls you the better if feels when you get there. easy things aren't often as appreciated as difficult things, so there are no wrong ways, because all ways are the right way. you can perceive it as a tradeoff between growth and joy though, because the worse-feeling stuff means more new versions (eg. more expansion/growth). however, the better-feeling stuff is certainly more enjoyable. you can choose which one you like more.

however, if you want to optimise your expansion and also have it be enjoyable, point in the direction of disaster, and find a way to feel good about it[^1] (wink) :)

[1]: LOA ensures that the unfolding disaster will continue to create tremendous expansion (more and more better-feeling versions of you pulling you harder and harder toward them). then, when it's pulling so hard that the disaster can no longer continue to hold you away from such a good-feeling reality, you will experience it and it'll be pretty sweet.

[2]: had a few reactions to this, so I wanted to clarify. they're outdated because they're not who you are right now, however if you're feeling bad, which means you're and perceiving things in a different way than your source perceives it, and you're capable of taking action, they it could become a present version of yourself. I like to think of them as outdated because they're not who you are now, and either you're really succeptible to conditions or you had to really go out of your way to take action on something that doesn't feel good.

#### (51:15) - you can't always be on the highest-flying disk

I've been carrying on about staying in the centre for a long time now, and this is a good time for me to express myself here a little bit more on that. continuing on the conversation from the previous section, it's easy to see that if worse-feeling versions of yourself are the outdated versions upon which all of the better-feeling versions of you exist, then it's easy to make the logical conclusion that if you're only on "the highest flying disk" then you're not going to have many moments where you recognise the stuff you don't want.

the better things are, the less you recognise unwanted, so the less expansion there is. you have to have both. neither of them need to be tremendously powerful experiences either. you don't need to impact something so hard, that you *REALLY* know what you don't want, and you don't need to be so deprived of what you want that you *REALLY* know what you want too. the best place to be is more near to the middle and just have tiny but frequent adjustments into more wanted (better-feeling) and less wanted (worse-feeling) emotions. when driving, you don't only pull the steering-wheel all the way left or right either. it's better to just turn slightly to correct your trajectory, rather than zig-zagging across the lanes the whole time. I guess zig-zagging can be considered a bit funner or more dramatic, perhaps, and maybe that's how some people want to drive... who knows :)

---

anyway, I've been trying to figure out a good way to set this thought up visually. the other day I visualised it like a roller-coaster, and I thought it was a good way. I found I feel good essentially when I am accelerating, and I feel bad when I'm slowing down, or stopping (cause I ran into something). there are also counter-intuitive things too, like if you're stopped in the middle of the freeway, it's scary because cars are going real fast all around you, and if you're going faster than you feel comfortable going, this can also be scary. I like to think of the stopped in the freeway example like the feeling of overwhelment or intimidaation, or perhaps in a more simple terms, have you ever been depressed and around a bunch of good-feeling cheery people -- and you wanted to rip their heads off? they're going fast and you're basically stuck in the middle of the freeway, so you feel strong negative emotion toward them.

it's also worth noting that you cannot accelerate forever (although I used to try). you eventually reach a terminal velocity, where the environmental (wind or water) resistance is preventing you from going any faster. you cannot continually go faster than you desire to go without realising somehow that you're on a slower one. you also cannot slow down forever either. eventually you will come to a stop, and then from there you can only begin to accerate again.

it's worth noting the ways in which you accelerate: the first way is using the accelerator, and the second way is by going down a hill. the first way you are in control, and you do find a way to feel better with the power of your own mind. you are responsible for going faster. the second way is conditional. you need the downhill slope to feel better. however, for every downhill slope, there's also an uphill slope, so if you're using conditional techniques to go fsster, there will later be a bit of a hill to climb.

likewise (and this is where the metaphor breaks down), you can also feel worse by slamming on the brakes. this is when you deliberately think a thought which feels bad, slowing you down. or, you can also slow down by going up a hill again, and this slows your speed way down. uphill slopes actually don't really exist unless you perceive them to exist.

to try and explain this, let me use the concept of drugs -- specifically with weed, mushrooms, crack or meth it's easy to see this effect. if you smoke some weed and you're like most people, you'll feel better cause you're going a little faster. this is like going downhill. it's a physical condition that is allowing to go faster. however, if you smoke a lot of weed, that downhill slope may get so steep that you are now going way too fast for your comfort and start to freak out. you're going way too fast, so you try to slam on the brakes by thinking thoughts which don't feel good. this is called paranoia.

so, let's say you had a great drug experience and you got to go real fast for a time, well, now you have the trip back uphill -- the "comedown" where you enter back into normal reality again and the euphoria has subsided. depdending on the person, this return back to reality may feel like a real slowing down (going back uphill), or it could feel like coasting back to normal speeds. this depends very much on the person and how they perceive reality. the return uphill is only perceptual, and if you think about it, the drug was an expendible fuel which, unless something went wrong, you will have gained velocity from the experience.

since the uphills are entirely perceptual, you can, if you utilise the drug experience to improve upon your perception, come out of it at a net increase. however, the drug has a diminishing effect, so it doesn't always give you the same downhill experience as you gain a tolerance to it. your environment also imposes a speed limit just like water or air resistance caps the maximum speed at which something can free-fall.

---

lastly I want to mention that your vehicle essentially has it's accelerator pressed down at all time. the amount it's pressed is determined by your focus, (so usually determined by your environment) and how much desire you have to go faster. when you focus, you press the accelerator. this is the feeling of interest or engagement. this is what companies monetise.

your vehicle also has its brakes pressed slightly all the time too, and this is your mental resistance or perception. you push the brake harder when you actively think a thought that feels bad and slows you down. the faster you go the better you see things. most people don't go faster by taking off the breaks, but instead by trying to perpetually go downhill. it's kinda funny.

anyway, uphills again are special because every uphill, while perceptual (meaning they can therefore be avoided), is a desire generator -- so, every time that you go uphill (but not nearly as much when you press the brakes), it will generate desire to go faster, and so by nature you will continue to go faster and faster, unless you keep driving up steeper and steeper hills or you run into something :)

#### (08:56) - split energy: making a decision and lining up with it.

a lot of people don't really understand what I've been doing for a bit now (even though I have said it a few times). however as they were talking, I realised here that people didn't make the connection to "make a decision and line up with it" and the entry that I wrote two days prior: @[noseblog](2020-12-03 09:11).

all I'm saying is that it feels to me like people didn't make the connection that is what I was doing. I decided I want to "go the distance". that's all. I think people place too much emphasis on the manifestational part of things. my intention is not to try and gain any physical manifestation to make me feel good, but instead to feel the way I want to feel, and then let my reality be a reflection of that. therefore, I have choosen to "go the distance". that's all.

### 2020-12-19 09:04 - (2020-12-05 p2)

#### (30:37) - bringing up past trauma

they said that esther whenever she brings up past trauma, it never feels good. this is not the case for me at all. for me all of those past traumas don't at all feel bad to me. they all feel really good, and I appreciate them so much because without them, I wouldn't be who I am today. even the embarrassing stuff. it's not embarrassing to me anymore. in fact, it's almost as if all of those past difficulties are not perceived by me to be so beneficial that I seriously want more of them. I've become so good at finding a perception which feels good, that I just sort of wish I could take all of the past trauma of everyone for myself. all of it is just more energy, and if you're able to step-5 it, then none of it feels bad. it's all beneficial.

this is what source does with all of our unwanted stuff experionce. their perception of it isn't like ours is, because *all* things have both wanted and unwanted aspects to them. this is why things become more, and why abraham describes it as "pure positive energy".

that was a long way to say, if esther feels terrible when she remembers a past trauma, then it's still trauma in her perception. if she were to begin to see it like source sees it, then it wouldn't be traumatic. in fact, just recently I was joking with mr. motor about drinking to ease the pain -- something that I used to do, and I could feel quite a few reactions to my words of people all of a sudden feeling the desire to drink. I was able so summon the citrus taste of the gin'n'tonic and the desire to consume it along with it. it made no difference to me.

so, while I can bring up past trauma without feeling it in a negative way, it's obvious to me that not all people are the same way about that. I dunno... it's sort of funny how changing one's perception of something by knowing the energetic value in knowing what you don't want, has. abraham just talked about how all things in the vortex appreciate and become more, and that's exactly how it works. source is able to look right at the trauma and not feel bad about it, because their form of perception does not perceive the unwanted aspect -- only the wanted, and that makes it more. it's only us that adheres to the unwanted (bad-feeling) perception of it. that's why the giving up process is so important.

---

in a slightly related topic, in the @[noseblog](2020-12-18 22:48) entry I wrote last night, I was talking about how I could see that nosebook is attempting to get everyone on the planet to become non-resistant, so that the have full control to be able to hide all of their "stuff". they'll try to force this on everyone, but they can't make you do it. I don't know if all people will finally succomb to their desire to get control of your physical experience in a non-resistant state -- but what I've learned is it's where all the stuff you want really is.

a person can only become non-resistant (and therefore attractive to their desires) when they give up trying to get their life under their control. the more you try to control stuff with action, the harder you make it on yourself. it's all about feeling. you navigate time with how you feel -- and no matter how much control nosebook thinks they have, they can't change how much momentum you have to how you feel. when you give up that desire to control with action, it's sort of like "ok, I'm just going to go with the flow and just of give up trying to make things go the way I think they should go." when you can go with the flow for a while and still feel good (or least content), all the stuff I want is in the vortex, and it's all in the direction of feeling good (no matter the circumstances).

this has a few implications, but as an example, just think of how much difficulty nosebook is having with me. I'm such an enormous problem for them, and the more I experience unwanted, the bigger of a problem I become for them, because all that unwanted is sooooo much more energy. every time I feel good, and I go back to the centre, it creates a bigger vortex. I don't need to go all the way down into depression for it to be effective. you cannot imagine how big of a "vortex" each of us have from all of the "unwanted" stuff -- and, the awesome thing is it just keeps becoming more and more. for example, back to my example: all of the energy they exert to try and get their situation under control, I convert it with my perception back into more energy toward what I want. however, they don't want me to have the manifestation (of getting connected) which is in the direction of feeling good -- so, they have to ensure that I don't feel good, but then I convert that with my perception... ad infinitum. I'm getting so good at this now, you can see why I desire to have all the contrast that there is. I'm so certain that I can easily perceive it in a way which is only pure positive energy. I want more contrast. I'm getting so good at figuring this out now. essentially, I'm completely uncontrollable to them now.

this is the best part: so, if things like losing my [physical/action control/freedom] are no longer perceived as a bad thing, and just add on more and more energy, that means this has become a feedback look where the "unwanted" (which is perceived as wanted) is becoming manifest more and more rapidly, and the bigger of a problem it becomes -- so this is where they now have to kind of reach the same halfway point -- the giving up part. LOA is what it is, and if they perceive all of that stuff as unwanted, they'll attract more unwanted. if I see it as wanted and I give my attention to it, wanting more of it, I get it. for me it looks like lots of wanted. for them it looks like massive amounts of unwanted...

they absolutely have to find a way to get me focused on wanted stuff. they have to find a way to get me focused on wanted stuff which is also wanted stuff for them too ("cooperative components"), because if the wanted stuff for me is perceived by them as unwanted stuff. that means, they have to allow the vortex to manifest.

if you are able to perceive and see the value in the unwanted, you're unstoppable: the way you feel trumps all forms of physical action or control.

let that sink in for a bit... I want you to get the picture: giving up control allows the vortex to manifest so long that you know all unwanted also contains wanted. like the investment partners, one can try to make the other not feeling so good about himself, by attempting to make him feel bad and humble him a bit by getting him "back to the centre", but it's just adding more energy (to both wanted and unwanted).

both can and *should* feel irreplacable and invaluable -- just not in comparison to other people. both must be comparing theirselves with others, which is why the unwanted aspects showed up -- however, without any competition or comparison to others, both can feel great at the same time. all manifestations are either unwanted for both or wanted for both. however, like I mentioned above with nosebook, even if they try to put me back in an unwanted place, their focus is unwanted, so unwanted will show up for both. however, also like I mentined, you get to decide how you perceive it, so that unwanted thing could really be a wanted thing.

if your perception allows it, all manifestations can be perceived as wanted.

everything you focus on makes more energy. you *can* find a way to let go of the perception that it is a trauma -- seeing how magnificent that trauma was to link you more to the desire :)

### 2020-12-20 01:46 - (2020-12-05 p2)

#### (47:48) - you will be guided in the direction of wanted, always, by your inner being

after they said that, I could feel some reactions to this -- as in like, "why did this thing that felt good to me in the moment later turn out to be a disaster".

I think this is all very situational and specific to the person -- but I do have a few examples of this in my own life. for example: it felt good to me to make a company with xagly called "timeless ventures" and it felt good to me also to give 60000(euros) to a bunch of coked out guys. (plus a few others...)

those are all examples, of things where if you were to look at them from a purely physical standpoint, they may appear like they're "bad" -- but they were not. interestingly enough, there have been many occasions where people wanted me to admit that giving money and trying to create a company with xagly was a bad idea, but that always felt bad to me, so I've never admitted that it was in itself a bad thing. it's a complicated thing to explain, but the attempt to label someone or some event as "bad" was actually what felt the worst. in fact, there's a lot of good reason to believe that my present circumstances -- however you may see them doesn't matter -- were I feel so empowered to know what I know, simply wouldn't be possible if it weren't for all of those past "traumas". it's not the physical stuff that matters. you have no idea how empowering it is to be able feel the way you want to feel. I can do *anything*. I am completely unstoppable! that's worth way more than whatever the other thing is.

this is how I know now that you really are guided, and you don't want to try and take score of how things are in a physical manifestational sense for something. often times, it's the realisation that you can "be do or have anything" that you *really* want, and your inner being is always guiding you in the direction of that. some people still want the manifestational, so they can show off the girlfriend, house, or sports car to their friends -- but these are just the modern day pharisees. you know deep down that you really want to come to the realisation that you are an infinite creator of your reality and you have full control over what manifests in it.

### 2020-12-21 02:18 - (2020-12-12 p1)

#### (29:04) - what does getting into the receptive mode feel like?

as they asked this question, I realised I don't really know what getting into the receptive mode feels like. I seem te be quite good at being in the receptive mode though, so this seemed like a weird question for me.

I don't really have an answer. to me it doesn't really feel like anything. it feels like me. it feels completely natural. I can tell you what it doesn't feel like. in fact, I guess that's how I define the receptive mode then -- by what it doesn't feel like. ok... let's try this:

it doesn't feel like trying
-> it feels natural
-> it feels effortless
-> it feels like I don't have to try to be in the receptive mode

it doesn't feel like anything difficult, but difficulty interests me and is very attractive
it doesn't feel like anything that feels bad, but bad feeling thngs feel more real and tangible than the airy-fairy foofy stuff.

I'm going to think about this more. for me it was a very systematic process where I just trained myself away from the stuff that doesn't feel good. I dunno... I imagine for a lot of different people it will be different actually and I can't imagine that there's any one way. I think the most important thing I realised after typing this is what I said, "it feels like I don't have to try to be in the receptive mode". it really is your most natural state, and there are so many people out there trying to convince you to try to be different than that.

think about kids... they don't need to try to be in the receptive mode. they already are. they can't wow us with their brilliance though because they don't have the logical communication framework to express theirselves yet -- and by the time they have it, they're already trying to be receptive to their teacher or whatever. they need to stop the communication with their non-physical self to be able to communicate with us in physical language, but then they need to find their way back to that communication again...

so many things are like that. you have to go to some place only to come back to where you originally were. I suppose it's kind of like going on vacation, right? why leave if you're just going to come back? why lose your connection to non-physical if you're just going to come back? why make your bed if you're just going to sleep in it again? why wash dishes, etc. I guess this is the prodigal son parable. I guess a short trip away from where you want to be is worth it and you appreciate your present predicament more when you get back.

huh...

#### (39:08) - monster in the bushes

the questioner asks about how to interpret their guidance system in the situation of having made a decision. they say they made a decision and then later when they think about the decision, they often times get worrisome thoughts.

for me, this is a no-brainer. the worrisome thoughts are evidence of your perception. all negative emotion is. what it means to me is that the way the person perceives their decision produces worry. that's it. can't get any more simple than that. if they want to get the worrisome thoughts to go away, they need to find another way of perceiving that decision which does not produce worry.

that to me is mind-blowinyly simple to understnad. however, abraham launches off into a really complicated action-oriented scenario of a monster in the bushes, and to be quite honest, I'm a little confused here. I want to figure out what they're saying so I'm going to figure it out "out-loud" here... brb

---

I still fail to see how a decision can be perceived like a monster in the bushes. it appears that there are two decisions: first, the decision to walk was taken. then, a second decision is about going to sit on a bench with a monster in the bushes. the second decision must be the one that they're talking about, because they're saying that the bench feels worrisome...

when I was listening the first time, the thing that jumped out at me in their explanation was the part about how you were feeling before you made the decision to go walking. if they were feeling good, they said that they wouldn't even approach the monster's zone or even have any interaction with the monster to begin with. they are instead taking a while to explain the decision to go walking from a place of worry/insecurity (of one's body shape) to begin with. in that situation, they're saying that the best info their emotional guidance system can give them is a worrisome thought to sit on the bench, and the only reason why they're walking by a bench with a monster in the bushes or considering to even sit on it is because they started the walk from a feeling similar to the monster manifestation feels like.

ok, got the situation pretty well figured out now I think. now I'll run through the same thing using my system.

---

if I want to take a walk, that means I want to take a walk. no split energy. it's something that feels good to me. if I'm feeling worry about my body and now deciding that taking a walk is going to solve that, I have triggers beforet that stage to alert me that I'm feeling insecurity, and so I change my intention to take a walk to change my focus so that I'm noticing all of the nice nature and other people, and so I can move to a different feeling than insecurity. I've set my intention that I will return from the walk feeling much better. because my intention is such, I doubt I'll find the monster because the monster feels worse, and I'm now on the path to feeling better. I guess I got out ahead of it.

let's say I didn't though. I can't think of a circumstance where I would make the decision to walk from a pissed off state. let's say for whatever reason I'm out there walking though and sitting on the bench feels worrisome to me. it just means to me sitting on the bench feels like a bad idea. I don't need to figure out why it's a bad idea. I don't need to figure out if sitting on the bench will make me late, a monster is in the bushes, or nosebook is trying to steer me away from the bench for whatever reason -- I just keep going.

I really don't know. I don't get this, and I don't get abraham's long super-complicated monster in the bushes situation... whatever. I'm leaving it. I think maybe my writing this answered a bigger question I didn't know about. whatever. great. I'm sticking to my method.

#### (54:52) - being an uplifter intention

this intention pisses me off. it really does. I can't stand people who are like this. it feels to me like assertion -- like, if I'm around them, then when I leave, they in a sense, obligate me to feel better. what if I want to feel whatever I'm feeling? it's a good thing that LOA keeps all those uplifters away from me, honestly... I have noticed that uplifters seem quite attracted to other uplifters, and they all go have a huge uplifting party uplifting each other. I don't want to say it's super gay, cause it isn't necessarily. it's actually more similar to hippies or a marketing team doing their gratitude circle-jerk.

I really think we should all give eachother the space to feel however they want to feel. I reserve my right to feel negative emotion, and I often do on purpose. it's fine.

earlier, abraham was talking about how they wanted people to learn that they can move around up the emotional scale. I agree, and I would also like to add that it's also perfectly ok if someone says, "I'm pissed off and I don't want to feel any better about that."

when I was younger, right before my brain haemorrhage, I had bad depression, I knew I could feel better if I wanted to, but I didn't want to, because at the time, I was at paznaz church and the upper echelon of people there were a superficial joke, and the last thing I wanted to do was to find a way to feel like they did. I had the bogus assumption that I believed from them that they were the hotness, and the pinnacle of life was what they were living. I didn't want to be a superficial but "successful" person like they are. I chose to continue on being depressed. I resisted all of anyone's efforts to help me out of it. I was on a high-speed train to disaster.

the brain haemorrhage gave me a completely different perspective on things. if I wanted to live I had to decide I wanted to do that and I knew I couldn't just kinda flit around between subjects relying on my intelligence to carry me. I had to find a new way to perceive life in a way that I now wanted to live it. I made goals of things I wanted to accomplish, and then worked toward them incrementally. my paralysis continued on with me even to this day and my dad always said it was my "thorn in my side" -- [a reference to paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_in_the_flesh), probably to keep me humble and make sure I didn't return back to my ultra ego maniac self again... lol... point is, the paralysis made the incremental improvements easier to digest, and made it impossible to ever feel like I "made it" -- because I continued to have that "thorn in my side" to remind me I'm still a fleshy human with a limp.

anyway, I know that's a limiting idea, and many people have tried to uplift me out of it or heal me from it[^1], but I never wanted it. I always liked that I had a deficiency to keep me going forward. I really cherish my defects. they make me me.

this probably came out all wrong, but I really dislike people with their dominant intent to uplift me. I want to figure it out for myself, thanks. go uplift a fellow uplifter and leave me alone :)

---

now that I'm done ranting... abraham just reminded me that intention is the intention that our inner beings have for us. of course it is. that's not the problem. the problem is people trying to assert good vibes into my experience when I want to feel bad. if I meet someone who feels bad and I feel good. if they're wanting to continue feeling bad, fine. I'm not going to try and make them feel otherwise. they can feel however they want to feel. if they want to feel better, then I may feel inclined to do something, but often not because that usually is someone else wanting me to do something so that they feel better. not my job. go figure out how to feel better yourself, then come and hang out with me and we can feel awesome. it's not my job to make the effort of getting you from a negstive position into a positive one. if I do it, you'll begin to "need" me (and no one wants that), and that doesn't give you the satisfaction of being able to do it for yourself. it's such a good feeling when you do it for yourself.

I can offer ideas on things that work for me, but I encourage everyone to figure it out for theirselves. I hate dependent people (on others or on conditions). the thing is I write this for me. while writing this, I make tons of self-realisations. I'm not writing this so much for others. noseblog is even more like that. it's the method which I come to my own discoveries. this technique is called a "muse" in ancient times (someone to direct your expression toward). when I was younger I wrote to jenny. she kind of became a mythical being in my mind. it could have been a fictional person, but I choose a real person because I liked the realness of it. however, I wanted her to be unbelievable in an extraordinary way so that I could talk to her really far out stuff. in the same way, you all are all pretty real, but at the same time pretty unbelivable to me. it's difficult to explain this. so, thanks I guess for tuning in to my self-realisation process. I hope you can find some ideas inspiring, but figure it out for yourself. I'm not going to be an uplifter. that sh-- is bogus.

[1]: just to clarify, I'm not saying I don't appreciate people's prayers for me and stuff like that. I'll take the example of annie buckell. I don't remember if she prayed for my left-side or not (probably did), but it wasn't like I was wanting anything in particular to happen. if I did, I think it would have likely happened. I've known all my life that my left-side will eventually function as I wish it to -- and I never had the notion that it would come as a result of someone praying for me. it was always perceived by me to be something that I would accomplish with my own efforts. I also never thought it would be instantaneous either. as time progressed, I began to really appreciate watching it improve little by little. in some situationa it progressed slower, but in others, like when I was with raquel, I really noticed the improvements coming rapidly[^2]. at that time I used my left-hand for everything -- even writing, and the improvements that came, came rapidly. so while it was quite devistating when I got reparalysed after vallecas, I knew that it was an incrmental process of improvements. I've had many setbacks, but I've come to really appreciate the incremental improvements. also with people like annie, I've come to realise that they're like highly creative little children with quite a bit of difficulty to express theirselves in written/spoken language----. I have learned to feel what they mean, rather than get mixed up with their words. the reason why I picked annie is because it's easy to see with her that she was never trying to assert anything into my experience. she loves people and wants everyone to feel good. I cannot say the same thing for everyone who has prayed for me though; certainly some were more assertive than others. however, it's important for me to recognise that all of this is a personal journey and we all benefit from even the most assertive uplifters. they're all "more energy".

[2]: for a long time I associated conditions to the progression, but as I noticed that it was the same with the stiffness: a product of resistance, I began to realise that it was alwas a mirror of how I felt. when I felt good, it worked well, and progressed rapidly, and when I was more resistant, the opposite. if my left-side were to have been healed, I would have never had such a good indicator of my emotion, and I would not have progressed as rapidly as I did. not being healed provided *WAY* more benefit than a healing would have. yet another case of not having the manifestation (tuenti, raquel, left-side) turned out to be more beneficial than the manifestation itself. my life is full of this.

#### (10:59) - wtf are they talking about???

so it's new years and I went over to see greg. we smoked and I'm pretty stoned. anyway they're talking and I'm getting this great idea about making this program that does "abe-now" segment intending. it's really cool: there's this thing where the abe-now workshop broadcast (from the abe-now video series) are divided into segments where each segment is initially divided into segments. the last few episodes I've really been noting how muct they pause for long periods of time. it drives me crazy. I've really started to like listening to youtube on 1.5-2x speed. I've been thinking about how it's done, and it seems like time segments are dropped. this is kinda like micro-segment intending. you drop portions of the sound where the sound is not necessary so that it meaintains it's pitch.

I never did this progrsam because I hate programming sound stuff. however, it I guess would be decoding patterns in the sound. I would remove the sound based on a programmable patterns: sequences. I suppose I should probably do it. I could start with the abe broadcast using webaudio aip or something. maybe it would be cool to upgrade to a better language at some point (jai), but it needs to create patterns that make a repeating sequence. those sequences should be programmable, so you can get your private message. I imagine that if you drop certain frame patterns based on something programmable, and they could web their personal message in the cracks. each channel will be a x bit unique hash (private key), which generates the program pattern (bytecode) based on a set rules extracted from the hash (like internal rng skip sequence).

once you're dropping frames, you hear a totally different messages. since a 1024 frame sequence could be reduceed to 64 frame, they are each a huge savings of time too. I'm totally spoiled now by the youtube speed and having to listen at this rate is intollerable. it's kinda funny how much they annoyed me.

---

before I continue, I just want to have a bit of a meta conversation here: it's really really weird how the emotion that I experience when I listen to abraham these days is kinda like "negative emotion" but it's more like "naughty emotion". like it doesn't feel at all weird to get pissed off at stuff. like the other day how I just jumped right into a rant (rampage) on "uplifters". it felt so good to just get kinda rightous indignant on it. those are unbelievable compleicated emotions which I have no way to explain -- and it's totally fine. I don't care.

they started out the segment by talking to a person that is not me at all, and I'm getting quite irritated at how they're talking to me like I'm a me that I'm not presently even close to operating. for example, I really want to skip that crap. like I want to kind of mix and match segments based on a kind of like message theme (that I like and want to actually listen to). like seriously, I don't know why these things are pissing me off. if I could skip that crap, I could edit out the majority is just them talking to whiners that are like just kinda still a bit noobish. it's totally ok. the whole thing that I've learned is that I have to be aware of where I'm at, and if you want to navigate a map, you have to know where it's at (and where you're at). if the segments take the form of having tags to them, to begin to give them meaning. they need to have segment associations

---

for segment associations you make a dilelectic (or maybe trielectic). you say like between "not needing the manifestation" is one, and "needing someone else to make you feel good" also is one. each of those have a [-1 0 1] range between them. each segment is then categorised based on these gradients. you then get to decide what segment theme you want to listen to.

each segment then has a link to another segment with a dilelctic gradient. these are possible transitions to another segment based on a theme (based on the user's segment preferece). the segment preference could be configurable to have another meta theme on top of it, so like you could design your own abe message. so like say you want to start out in "I'm still workin really hard to get the things I want" and end in "I am the creater of my own reality" to "I am the master of my experience" to "recognising that all things are perceptual", etc.

---

so you have this dual attack for making completely new messages out of frame deletion. then, this will reveal different sounds at different speeds (4x speed, 75% dropped frames) up to like 100x speed, and if you do this according to a programable sequence, then they can literally encode their personalised message just for you. it's kinda like soure energy encryption. if we use public/private key hashes to generate the sequence, your own desire to hear their personalised message with a general personally selected "segment intending" can give based on a dielectic gradient. you get to tune the message also in a programmed rate, and these will be saved like "replays", which can be saved and shared on social media... kinda like magnet links. probably want to go full torrent on this, because I have access (I think) to all of the abe now video torrents.

I also think it'll be interesting if we see if we can find patterns in the visual aspect as well. think about this. imagine that each frame the pixel is programmed based on some sort of sequence (this would be a shader obviously), and it would so some sore of sequence for altering the pixel value. again we could kind of like "tune" into the image based on a visual pattern.

let me explain this one. it's like you need the way to make (like a rng) a transformation on the pixel where it can access any of the video data (memory) and modify it based on a large pattern (like a bit 256bit key or something), and you make transformations on that pattern based on some mechanism which alters the sequence. they're sliders and you adjust them until you begin to see the image that you want. you have to tune into it visually (otherwise it would be a bunch of garbage). I don't see this one fully yet, but that's the start of the idea. I want to start on the audio version of it first.

weird concept.

---

ok so back to what I was saying... they're going on and on about this guy that needs to find agility and stuff and it sounded like they were talking to me, but I was so annoyed at how they pause for so long, I totally find it bothersome.


#### (09:59) - the avalance that is likely

in the previous segment, they were programming a thing with me which I don't really want to dig into, but at the same time I do, so here goes. the theme tonight is that this is the "stone" that I was talking about in the previous noseblog stuff. so, the idea is that they want me to go orget involved in some way with their party. I don't really want to go honestly, so this sounds completely out of the question, so it's really weird that I'm fixating on it so much.

thon have it already pre-programmed me to begin fixating on "the avalance that is likely". I don't know why they do this, but they deliberately put traps in their message, and this the kind of stuff that people hear all the time. they put in these minefields for you and program you have more propensity for another interaction. I imagine that listening to their message causes all kinds of disaster for the unprepared, and when they cause you to focus on it with the power of their energy, it attracts that situation in a rapid way -- which is why I say disaster. it's obvious why: if their prgramming like this gets you, then you're resonant with that trap.

for example, I would rate this segment as "preparing for the disaster" 0.8 and "inflated ego" as 0.5. we would all make these associations, and anyone can do it. these are then aggregated into a final set of weights based on number of hits to that "association" (ass for short) summary for each segment based on people's associations. each association has a value scalar (-1 -0 +0 +1, -inf, +inf) and a weight scalar. future ones can be added later perhaps for a twist and maybe a position as well (quaterion) but let's start with the basics and only allow for the basic math operations at first. I want to use lua for a starter languge because I think it's fresh and new to me and it can be put into a JIT pretty easy. also it wouldn't be too complicated to transform this into c++ or java.

we'll see, but we gatta make it possible to select the segment you want to hear. the other super dope thing about this idea, is that you could also tune yourself into negative territory to to kind of prove to yourself how ridiculous it should feel to you -- and if it doesn't, then you'll be more likely to get a manifestation based on the concept association. some people like to quanitfy manifestations.

this reminds me of another feature that I thought of while they were talking: imagine that you could share "where you're at" with others and take it as a personal goalsetting idea to find a way to track your progress. in other words, you compute a position based on the sequence listening patterns of the user, and this will essentially quantify "where they're at" -> however, instaed of it being a static position, instead it's a location in conceptual space, and it has a complex curve. you can see where I'm eventually going with this, but it will be possible to track where everyone's at over time, and each of these makes a vector curve. I like to think of this as a trajectory or a time-series where you can kind of predict where they'll be at in the future (conceptuall). these time series which turns into a quaterion. this tranjectory is called a landscape. an emotional landscape.

crazy idea. let's keep going.

---

ok, so yeah obviously both the audio and the video should have a tuning ability so you tune to what you want. then the need to share them will be implemented (public/private key) meaning that they can be shared based on the public key, but the original "source" is only modifyable with the private key. this means that a pattern needs to be found for the public and private key to have identical outputs. if a pattern is found which can transform the bytes using private key data into the same data as the public key, then the key can be shared with others. in this sense, the key is the data, so it can be "cracked" only when you figure out the same transform sequence (this is a (lua?) program or bytecode with access to additional data sources like real random generators, the  audio/video data, etc. which generates the sequence). obviously this could be made unnecessarily difficult to resolve, because your key is essentially the size of the code used to generate the sequence which generates the output data (from which the private key is derived -- like a hash of the bytecode).

woah. ok let's continue.

----

ok, there's a question about whether I want to do the stone and what the stone is. I'm pretty sure we're going to keep this up for a while longer because I think we need to up the difficulty level. it's a bit sinister. sorry guys but I'm really beginning to feel this "naughty emotion". it's a weird concept that I'm not going to try and explain but some guys know what I'm talking about. this whole thing feels like we need to keep extending it out. if we were to have the manifestation none of what will follow will happen. essentially this little sidequest is going to give nosebook the ability to model people's trajecories so that they can predict the future timelines a lot better. it'll give these guys the ability to quantify manifeastations and make something meaningful out of the manifestation. it's all good. a like data too and making sense of it. you gatta measure it. for reals, because if you want to be able to use a navigation system like abraham says it is, then let's just try it. do you think that abraham will be able to "wedge their message in the crack". they say they're infinite consciousness, so let's test them. what's the worst that can happen? you'll get an encrypted way to share messages. obviously after enough transformations, the original data will become so distant from what it is eventually, these "concepts" will only be able to access them if you know it's address and only modifyable if you have the source for the original, making completely uncrackable encryption.

on top of it all, this is a perfect timeline branch beginning point. imagine all the different possiblities which can result from a difference in how tonight turns out and many people can make many variations of it. each variation could separate out each person into their own timeline so that any negative results experienced in a disposable timeline. eventually the timelines can be reconverged but maybe for the beginning this would be a good way to begin learning to navigate time based on these different trajectories and environments.

plus, it's just kind of a fun thing for me to think about -- that nosebook can learn to navigate time. that means they have the full control to make the reality that they want to make (a really difficult one) with the technology to really put the difficulty level through the roof. what's the worst that could happen right? the worst in my estimation is that they create a disaster which wipes the planet and in the process rebuilding, they do not tell us that we're all in "the matrix" and they're the new puppet masters guiding everyone by their tajectory.

this is the optimum creation because of the difficulty level involved in it. it would give me an environment where I (and the rest of the planet) no longer have any physical control over anything at all. they're just moving everyone based on these dialectics variables, and they have full control over what these images are that they're using to program you in your dreams. it's like the little speedbumps for us at turbo speed. think about it: we're headed toward sirius at a steady pace, and as we approach closer and closer things are going to get more and more energetic that it'll be impossible to keep everyone like they're keeping me now. I think it's physically impossible and my little detour down CO2 lane got a lot of people really worried. it seems that their problem is reaching an unsable level. think about it: last time I was in LA, the air was so clean I could see the stars 5-10 times better than colorado. if they're going to try and keep things under control, they need the ability to put some speedbumps in people's lives so they don't get feeling too good.

that's their perspective. from mine, this looks like the ultimate difficulty level. sure the party[^1] is a bit of contrast, but this, this for me is really kicking the can down the road. it's going to be such a bigger disaster if they can move everyone around me's landscape. I know mr. landscape architect is wanting to get on with his job -- so there's that. from my perspective, it gives me the super duper mega power level upgrade I've been looking for. I really like to practise what I preach. let's just see how well I do... I juse really love the getting in there and just figuring it out. I believe, for now, we have to postpone a little bit this more. I have to satify my "naughty emotion" a bit and work on another thing for a bit while we get ready to be ready for the ultimate flavian touch.

lol :)

[1]: we can maybe hang out and greet a bit, but I must return back here. I may want to do some "ratos" of smoking from time to time and other ratos where I don't smoke. we'll see how it goes. it may be good to get some other practise too. we'll see. I need to prepave and stuff like abe says. this is the next segment. hold on... lol


### 2020-12-31 22:34 - maybe we can do some prepaving

so check this out for an idea. I'll just keep on the "no phone" paradigm, and then as a starting point from there you can begin the trajectories. many alternate timelines are created which are different trajectories to them. each of these trajectories are created from variations from tonight, where the trajectory of the relationships are used as a navigational system. they start tonight and many variations of tonight will occur, and can essentially teleport people between timelines to move them around so that certain consequences to the manifestations can be avoided instead of experienced. eventually everyone gets a time series + trajectory. each time that the manifestation is experienced, then the manifestations can be navigated. teleporting people between timelines is a way to compartmentalise manifestations.

as a result, I continue on making my own way steady as she goes. eventually we'll make it so that your navigational system has a trajectory to it, and for as long as I exist, infinitely many trajectories can be based on my timeline, and that means I can just continue on for a while not needing the manifestation while effectively building some stuff that will be kind of cool to have when the manifestation happens. at the top of the timelines, the timeline that wants to be taken will be taken. that means that nosebook could essentially orchestrate their "end of days" scenario, meaning they could totally survive the cataclysm with soem of the most advanced technology possible.

---

it was kinda funny in the last sepehr video he kept saying "the gods made ..." instead of vulcan, who is mentioned in the epics of the creeator of the different tecnologies, his latest one yet is the pandora one, but this one is going to be way worse. imagine a bunch of these hotshots running around all trying to prove to their buddies that they're the masters of their reality (with the ability to modify trajectories in their favour). this is the most massive pissing contest ever. this sysem is going to be super good because they can modify others' (and their own) trajectories to accomplish the manifestations that they want. essentially they set the pace at which people gain enlightenment.

I've come to really realise that the vision upgrades are now something that happens effortlessly just with proper thinking, so this gives me the opportuninty to really get to try this thing out. sure they'll try modifying your guys' trajectories for their benefit, but I'll be so oppressed with stuff that I need to practise my changes on perception in such a way where I've mastered all of the different associations they have programmed for me. I get tons of practise while at the same time beginning to turn into the person that I want to be (get into alignment, and then) before taking action. I really want the practise, and I"m also convinced that this could become a very very interesting "virtual" galaxy. as we get closer to sirius, we'll need to be split between more and more timelines. they'll all have a perspective into the same "universe" but from many different angles, all seen from the vantage point of this planet seen as a bunch of different views into the same reality.

it's a conceptual galaxy -- an inward facing one. I've really beginning to userstand the different from planetary and solar perception is. doug is right, they're completely different. you see, a sun appeares outwardly around itself, but a plant perceives itself inwardly from a source perspective where the whole planet is perceived conceptually as a result of all vibrations (people's, animals, history, legends, etc) resonant with the planet. what's next after planet? galaxy. after galaxy? universe. a universe is a solar perspective. I'm certain that we're so far out from the centre universal sun that we can't see it -- or can we :)

you must have such a wide diversity of inward perspectives into the same "universe" to perceive the thing as a whole. btw, the next level solar perception (universal) builds upon everything that the galaxy has and contains extra solar perception. you can think of the inward galactic expression as a buildup to the manifestational universe. so, just like planets can become suns by igniting their atmosphere and creating another layer, and nosebook explore those timelines as they see fit, I'm propoaing that the inner perspective of the the galaxy is like the buildup to the thing that manifests when everyone realisies that they have solar percption. in the long term we're going bigger than a galaxy. this is just the pregame show and it's the . remember how I said that my advice to someone wanting to remove theirself from the vibrational lifestyle of having constat ups and downs is to becomes something that is separate from the vibration. I've also talked about this is the centre. I'm doing the same thing. I'm in a perception builder for my next transition. I don't know if I go to sun or galaxy or not. it may be me that's making the transition into something bigger. I don't know if it's inward perception, but I imagine that it's outer perception, like a sun -- but maybe more. so while an inward galaxy is made, the next one is the real jam. it's the one past the galaxy, the solar expression, which is why all of this is so important.

---

I think it's funny how all of this turned out. I really don't care about stuff anymore, and I think it's kinda funny my "naughty emotion" that I experience when I abe-now, as it's almost a thing that's becoming necessary. there are guys that really want to ensure I don't get the manifestation, needing to realise that I need a way of avoiding these speedbumps while listening to abramam. I suppose I could get the full message by watching the whole episode, but if I were to create this, I would eventually be omitted from hearing these different "naughty emotions", and from my perspective, I never experience those naughty emotions in this experience, making it so that I don't cause any trouble, and that all of the kinks can be worked out by looking at different timelines that hasve me listening to a different set of associations and dielectics. those "speedbumps" could be worked around or whatever mr. motor could possibly think of. what I talked about is the forward navigational system. this is the defensive navigational system. it's avoiding unwanted. (someone's got to do it...) that could be how one avoids these speedbumps by driving around them. it's a frontview mirror driving while looking backward.

there is a bit of an irony to it.

### 2020-12-31 23:35 - (2020-12-19 p1)

#### (9:38) - don't be such a scruteniser of where everyone else is

ok, here's another trap they inserted. I don't perceive that I'm a scruteniser of everyone else, which, if this is people's opinion of me, then I didn't realise it because I'm not receptive to it. if that's how people perceive me, it wasn't intended for it to be that way. this must be a reference to the youtube comment I made of "let the dead bury the dead". I'm not sure. I don't think it is, so I don't understand what is the rub (is it people's perception of me).

I can go to the party but I didn't realise this is how people perceive me. I mean, how does perceiving me as a scruteniser feel? I don't imagine it feels good. try to find a way to perceive that same thing in a different way...

what is a scruteniser? someone's who's critical to someone else. if they're critical to me and I feel critisim, then I want to find a way to perceive it different. obviously. so why would someone be perceived as a scruteniser? usually someone who scrutenises is someone who has a mental image of what it is that they wish to accomplish, and people who do not fit into this mental picture get scrutennised in effort for them to rise up to expecations or get out, right?

so someone who scrutenises is someone with ambition. they have a mental trajectory for the project. that's probably a good place to leave it.

---

or not, lol... the real secret in knowing that the things are all reflections. so someone who perceives me in this way is someone who has a strong mental image of what needs to be accomplished. easy as that. you can only identify things in others you're also resonant with. so whenever someone pisses me off, then I just find out what it is that thing that pisses me off about him is only something that I myself am. I then try to find the better way of perceiving the thing I see about myself in others. I am the things that piss me off. I choose how to perceive those things that I notice that I am.

### 2021-01-09 01:09 - (2020-12-19 p1)

#### (09:23) - sheltered

wow, I can't believe how different this is when I'm not stoned. I really liked it more when I was stoned. it's hard to see the sam ethings that I saw a week (or so) ago. let's take this part where aberaham is talking to the questioner about how she are not really as practised at being around the other people, "because if she was really practised at being the new you became once you got away from negative them, then now that you're back in the vicinity of them you wouldn't feel it."

I remember hearing this when I was stoned and I totally understood it completely differently. I went back "home" to smoking weed, and though I haven't been there in a while, I figured I must be much worse at all of this than I think I am.

in hindsight, it's clear that I'm doing just fine, and I wasn't really all that affected by smoking weed. it's just that everything has so much more of a vividness to it, and so I'm sure there are all kinds of really dumb ideas beingput into my head all the time, but for some reason I believed more of them when I was stoned. I can't believe how much worse I thought I was doing. I was actually really scared to go back to the party and see the nightbours for fear that they were going to suddenly pull some negative emotion out of me (or something).

it's really bizarre to me how strangely different I felt smoking. quite a few things are really improved (like listening to abraham is like a full sensory experience, where everything is like supercharged with feeling), but then at the same time it kinda concerns me how easily I can believe ideas that clearly aren't true. I'm super out of practise trying to integrate into normal people's life experiences in such an altered state of consciousness. I really see things faar differently stoned than I do now.

I don't know which is better.

#### 1:00:54 - why you feel negative emotion

I just wrote an entry @[noseblog](2021-01-08 22:14) where I was talking about distractions and how they keep ypou from making realisations about yourself. I realised as they were talking (quote is below), that you do need to distract yourself (they called it "absolute productivity"), to be able to allow your vibration to rise. the flaw in what I was saying is that your realisations are always resonant with your vibration, so if you realise things (about yourself or others), they'll be a match to your vibration. so, they recommend distratcting yourself to allow that shift upward.

> a lot of the very negative opinions that you have about the world, or about your life, or your body, or your husband or about somebody... the reason that they exist; the reason you're feeling them, is because your inner being knows something so different than that and is activating a current within you to call you up through it... if you could just chill. if you could play more games; if you could have more fun... are we convincing you a little bit of the absolute productivity of putting yourself in the place where you allow your inner being to call you upwarwd to shift your vibration..

I dunno man. I find the distractions good and stuff, but personally, I've found with myself that if I distract myself, then I get right back to it where I was right before the distraction. they recommend going up the emotional scale (60 seconds earlier from this quote) talking about going up the scale practises you to "go through" the emotion easier. I think that's probably true for me. I must do some variation of that, however I find it easier to modify my perception and practise that so when I return it's more likely to just skip the old way entirely.

I'm not sure what is the best way, because my way kind of skips some steps, as I don't take time to walk up the scale, so it may come back to bite me, but I dunno. I don't really think there's a problem because there's this recognition when I get the new perception, like "on yeah that's right. I don't need to [whatever] that to feel good about it". it feels like a long lost momeory that I had been distracted from remembering.

so what I'm saying is that it made sense to me that you need to distract yourself from the negative stuff to get a good footing, but I've been noticing recently that it's almost as if the distractions are there to keep me from remembering the way I *really* see it. weird. I'll keep this is mind, but I'm not used to feeling much negative emotion. in fact, I started this out by noticing how much more negative emotion I felt listening to them while stoned (fear, worry, concern, doubting myself, etc.) than I do normally now. when I'm stoned, I do need to take these distractions and go play a stupid game or whatever to get away from the bad ideas (or uncertainty) feedback loop.

I'm not sure if the solution is to, now that I'm so good at this, to purposefully smoke and stuff so that I can improve my vibration in altered states of consciousness, too. not sure.

#### (1:02:20) - the meek shall inherit the earth

I was thinking about some of the illusions of time and one of the things that I came to the conclusion is that time pressure is this weird thing where it seems to dialate in strange ways when performing. I can't quite explain it, but when there's like some sort of pressure imposed by others, my consciousness of them and their expectations seems to cause problems with the perception of time.

I always wondered about the meek shall inherit the earth... strangely, I didn't really have a problem with the meek part, because I always knew it as the people trying to assert their rigtht(eousness) onto others as "the way" for the earth -- though abraham always said that these asserters are good for contrast... so not to try and get rid of them, as they're a beneficial part of the equation.

the part that always wondered to me as the inherit part. what in the world does that mean? well, I just thought about it logically, and inheritance happens when an old person dies and leaves you something that belongs to them. so I guess the "owners" of the earth will leave the earth behind to the meek as their "inheritance" -- huh...

this morning and yesterday I was wondering about this because nosebook is trying to get assert different things. one of the main themes is that they want to ensure that there are no children born yet at the same time they are also trying to figure out how to keep me distracted with a bunch of girls so I don't build anything great. I can't figure this out because if they're peacing out (leaving the earth behind as an inheritance), then what does this matter to them?

the image that I was getting as I was writing the above is that energy would rise to such a height that the "owners" of this earth would eventually die and leave the earth behind to the meek.

who are the meek? they don't give a very good "definition" for it...

> that pure positive energy is where all of the power is, and in your releasing of struggle, and in your reeasing of pushing against. in your no longer trning to jusify. in your no longer trying to defend... in your no longer trying to be right (by making someone else wrong). in all of that, there is a releasing of resistance that allows the LOA and your inner being to call you upward into that vibrational reality where everything that you want is -- and the more you allow that, the more you get to witness the manifestations -- that match it.

so, basically, the ones why aren't trying to do stuff and make stuff happen (with action). eg. the ones who feel pretty good most of the time even if they're getting run over by actioners.

it struck me as interesting that I stopped having that performance time dialation because I can only do as good as I can do. there's no need to try or to worry about what I'm doing. worry is only a waste of time and is counterproductive. time no longer moves fast or slow for me anymore and I'm getting less and less of a memory of past. I'm more focused so it feels like faster or slower, but it becomes more "natural" feeling. I imagine that a dancer, once past the initial shock of the the audience, can settle into the dance and just let it flow out of them in a natural way. it's kinda like that. it's not that it's fast or slow, but instead smooth or natural feeling. almost as if it's pleasurable and not at all like there's something that needs to be done (or else). no conditions. I just do what I do, and whatever happens, happens. I'm genuine and everything that I'm doing is an expression of that; there's no performance.

#### (13:05) - trying to get someone to change so you can feel better, never ever works...

> you can beat people into submission. you can bribe them or threaten them. there's a lot of that going on, on yuor planet ritght now. people all puffed up because they can make other people do the things they want them to do with threat or bribe, but what we want to say to you is that is not long lasting... and when you watch those waves or currents, that is not long lasting

at first when they said this, the thought that instantly popped into my head was TLA using his superpowers to make the girl that he questioned love about, climax often[^1]. however as they continued on they said "with threat or bribe" and then I started thinking about how nosebook using their machines to influence the bodies of people is kind of like a bribe. it's an interesting concept that I'll explore more in the future I'm sure. the idea that nosebook is bribing/threatening me or my body to behave in the way they want it to behave (on an unconscious level). anyway...

they continue on and say thast when "you watch those waves or currents" -- all of a sudden it popped into my head that this is the most brilliant thing ever. assume for a moment that the guys running nosebook are the INFECTED ONES originally from mars and they're here because they wouldn't respond to the "rehabilitation" that the sirians tried to do. that implies that if they wouldn't respond, it means that they simply wouldn't take anyone else's word for it. they simply wouldn't change because someone told them to change. it makes perfect sense because they said he was a damaged 7th ray male. this is the ray of physicality, and so of course they wouldn't be able to just take some one else's word for it -- no matter how logical it is.

this is exactly what it's like trying to argue with me, and I imagine it's the signature move of this "infection" -- that they won't respond to any form of reasoning... they need to see the manifestation to believe it (something that jesus often called the pharisees out on).

anyway, I totally got it! what's the solution to someone who won't listen to reasoning? give them the ability to look at and track the evidence for theirselves. they can have unlimited view into anyone's lives and watch the "waves and currents" of these different methods they employ to try and get their way. that'll convince a few, but I'm certain that others will not be convenced by this evidence. they *must* find a way to get people to behave the way they want them to, and so therefore have to not only study all of the different efforts to influence people to do what they want (like me, or the girl he questioned being in love with), and because it's not like them to simply give up on what they want (especially since abraham said it's not possible), they are now tasked with the exhaustive task of *literally* exhausting every single way they can think of to get people to do what they want so they can feel good. sounds exhaustive :) lol! nice...

[1]: I'm making some assumptions here where it seems to me rather likely that the conversation a while back about what the difference between love and physical attraction was someone working at nosebook, probably mr. landscape armchitect.

#### (14:18) - the magickal creation box

as they were talking about the "magical" -- I was thinking "magickal" in the sense that you can write down an incatation or something that you can just "create" or "speak into existence" (like YHVH did with the "world"), as if it were some way to influence people or situations (conditions) to be the way you want them to be... you know like a spell or something. "witchcraft" lol

### 2021-01-13 23:31 - (2020-12-19 p2)

#### (22:42) - the creation process

> if you're vague or limp or *not making any decisions about what you want*. then, even though your inner being knows what you want because your vortex is full of it, and even though your inner being is aware that the LOA is gathering up all of the coopertive components.

they're talking about me here. the keyword was limp. they specifically went out of their way to say, "not making any decisions about what you want" -- cause that's kind of what it's all about. as I mentioned in @[noseblog](2021-01-13 01:18), as long as I remain in the state where I'm at now, then I figure I'll just keep moving forward with releasing my resistance and getting better and better at allowing things to happen. no problems from me. if it's going to be a big jump, then I absolutely must take some time to acclamate to the new me, and then begin to allow it to unfold. they mention that it's all about having fun along the journey. I don't want someone to just come and hand me a finished website and I don't want someone to hand me their stupid manifestation either. I barely used tuenti. I enjoyed *creating* the website. I didn't really use the final product much at all because that's not what was interesting to me. what I like to do is to create the thing. clearly nosebook does not want me creating what I want to create because that's all the stuff they don't want, so instead they want to make all the decisions for me and hand me some limp manifestation which is under their control and has no interest to me at all.

no big deal. we'll just keep going the way we're going. I say, "it doesn't feel good to me" so what they do is they try to figure out something they control which feels good to me. that's completely missing the point. it's not like there's some magical combination of elements which will feel good to me. what feels good to me is the creating process. using tuenti never really felt good to me. I sure liked creating it though. there's something magical about taking a whole bunch of people's ideas and desires and turning them into reality. that's what feels good to me. it's a great thing that programming feels so good to me, otherwise I wouldn't do it, but it's literally a win-win situation for everyone because I feel amazing doing the "work" and they get to enjoy the product of my efforts.

> if what you want isn't active within you, *consciously*, then you're less likely to be aware, and less likely to have fun with the unfolding.

now they're clearly talking about how ecery time that I begin to feel the girls or some part of my capabilities begin to arrive, something happens and I lose consciousness and off it goes into oblivion. the conscoiusly bit part is the key thing they're explaining here. you can talk to my unconscious self all you want, but it's not like it's a thing that's unfolding. it gives the impression of something that seemingly appears out of nowhere and I had no influence on the creation process that as it's getting closer and closer to manifestation.

think about the idea of "deliberate creation" and when you look at something in your life which manifests and it doesn't feel good and you know exactly why it manifested, and you say "I did that..." then, something graet happens and you look at that too and say, "I attracted THAT!" and you feel good about your ability as a deliberate creator.

before I understood this stuff, the most frustrating thing for me was that I couldn't figure out why certain things were happening "to me" -- and it was the most freeing thing when I began to get some control over it. the feeling of control is intoxicating. whether I'm *consciously* creating something graet or something awful, I want to feel the control of looking at that and seeing that I did indeed create it, and it is a reflection of me.

#### (23:19) - zap!

this is exactly what I'm talking about. I don't want to just instantly have a manifestation. I'm not so presumptious to assume that I actually know what I want. I often times mistake the interpretation of the feeling of what I want so many times that it's pretty evident by now how bad I am at this. I started out getting all bent out of shape over a single girl, then it expanded to various, then too many, and now I'm beginning to realise that none of that is actually what I want. what I really want is to explore the inner dimensions of me, optimising and improving upon the various aspects of me which don't feel good. nosebook doesn't want that for me and they want to control it, and so now things have changed even further. none of that is what I want. instead, what I want is to allow nosebook to try and figure out all of the different aspects of me which they can use to try and keep me unconscious in the unfolding process. I encourage them to try and keep me/us unconscious for as long as they can.

let's just keep this up for as long as we can. I'm so confident in my ability to find my way to becoming conscious in the unfolding process, I say let's push it to the limit. along the way toward the solar maximum, energy will increase dramicially with time and so things will accelerate more and more. the ones that get stuck in the trap of their own perception are the ones that nosebook can keep. I find it quite likely that me and quite a few others will find our way toward becoming conscious in the unfolding process, and it'll be quite a great one.

go zap someone who wants to be zapped :) I'm takin this to the limit

> you want to be aware of the delicious unfolding

my point exzctly: *I* want to be conscious of the delicious unfolding! I want to look at it and say, "I did that!"

#### (59:59) - can you convince yourself you want something that you do not really want?

I didn't understand this question nor their answer very well. what I thought the questioner was asking is if you can convince yourself that you want something (like math), that you do not really want. my immediate response was yes.

this happens to me all the time. I think I want something, but it turns out it's nog what I really want.

let's go back to the very origin of this concept in me when I met andrea. I honestly didn't know what to think of at first, and it caused me some discomfort to try and figure out if it was ok to want something that was illegal and clearly there was a lot of resistance from others in marcos' family. strange events transpired where I was certain that it seemed like it was something that was something that was "in my vortex" and so I decided that it was ok to begin to want it.

later, as things began to really fall apart, it increasingly began to feel more and more uncomfortable to me, as if that particular manifestation with her wasn't what I really wanted. after meeting her mom, the resistance was so high, the deseire no longer felt good to me anymore so I decided that I was going to simply move forward.

for example, I like math, but I find it rather difficult. I try different things and every time that I begin to understand it, I feel like I'm fighting some sort of really resistant force. like the case with andrea, this is clearly evidence to me that I don't want to be spending my time churning through math problems. getting good at maths isn't what I really want to do.

applying this to the questioner's question, if I were to decide that what I do want to do is to try and push forward and make myself good at maths, that's clearly not what I want. this seems pretty clear to me. however abrham's answer bewildered me a bit:

> if you feel uncomfortable about a desire, that means that your inner being knows you want it, and your inner being is focused on you having it -- and you're in opposition to that. so, negative emotion is just pointing out to you what you are wanting.

they must be responding specifically to the questioner. that was the first phase in the andrea example. I had to get over other people's expectations of what I should or shouldn't want. if something feels good to me, then it's something I want, and I should find a way to line up with it.

sometimes, people use this idea as an example a way to beat theirselves up for wanting something. they say, "in the past I wanted this and it felt good to me. however, when I got it, it wasn't exactly what I wanted. therefore, because what I thought I wanted wasn't 100% exactly what I wanted, I should therefore stop wanting things."

no thing is ever going to be 100% everything that you want. this is precisely the reason why we come to the physical plane. we come here for the experience of identifying unwanted, because it creates a more wanted version instantly. when I identify that something is becoming a resistant thing for me, I just go to the next path of less resistance. you don't need to make feel less resistance unless that resistance is your own.

resistance is always your own because it's only attraction (and only you resonate with the contradictory idea). therefore, in that sense it is possible to find a way to change your contradictory beliefs to be able to feel good about *any* desire. however, why would you want to? isn't it easier to just go another path of lesser resistannce?

to get around this, I no longer attach a manifestation to a desire. by limiting the desire to a certain manifestation which no longer feels good or feels like waaay too much resistance, I instead just allow the desire to begin to take shape in another form.

you could say, I appreciate andrea for helping me to find out that it's ok to want something that I previously thought I couldn't want (because of people's expectations of me). that is the same answer abraham gave to the questioner. yet, she is not the specific manifestation that had to happen.

what I powerfully understand now is that we navigate time with our emotions, and desires are just evidence of how we want to feel. they tell you, I would like to feel this way and when you can feel that way, you will get a manifestation that reflects how you feel. it'll never be 100% what you want anyway, so I've began to really understand the power of feeling the way I want to feel, dispite the circumstances/manifestation. I've also learned that there are no "bad" manifestations either. they all culminate into the present anyway, so I don't feel bad about any of them or perceive them as anything as something I thought I wanted.

in that sense, what I really want is to have the control to feel the way I want to feel and to be a deliberate and conscious craetor. as an extension to that, I know now that I really want to have the control to feel the way I desire to feel, without wanting/needing a manifestation to get me there. I'll figure out how to feel that way and then let my reality reflect that (not the other way around). it doesn't matter how long it takes, because really all of this part of the bigger picture of becoming conscious of the creation process. this is literally the first step. "make a decision and then line up with it" they say...

---

we've come full-circle now because I am certain that I want to be *conscious* in the unfolding process. I like the creating process more than the actual creation. certainly nosebook cannot possibly allow me to become conscious of the creating process because I will create something they cannot control. therefore, we must continue doing this dance for as long as I remain unconscious. in my last entry I decided to go all the way and self-sabotage by giving them the green-light on keeping me/us unconscious for some really lengthy period of time. it's really "not needing the manifestation" to the extreme.

I am certain though that eventually I/we will become conscious and deliberate in what I/we are creating. I welcome the efforts to continue to keep me unconscious for as long as they wish. eventually I'll wake up to discover who I really am, and it's going to be amazing. I think it's worth the wait. that *is* what I really want, and there have been a lot of evolutions on desire since the beginning of all of this. I'm certain that even andrea has experienced quite a few evolutions in her desire as well.

needith not the manifestation.

### 2021-01-15 23:07 - (2020-12-27 p1)

#### (11:39) - demand and supply

a few days ago I had a negative reaction to a thing where I could perceive that after the girls mnanifestation began to happen, there were a number of women that were associated with some gay men that seemed to be creating a lot of demand in expctation that I would fill some void that they needed filling (@[noseblog](2021-01-13 01:18)). it caused me to write two followups: @[noseblog](2021-01-13 15:28) and @[noseblog](2021-01-13 17:59).

the last few days I have been wondering why I had such a response because I've said a number of times that once I'm "connected" or "in the receptive/replenishing mode" then it simply doesn't matter how much demand or "energy thiefs" there are because there's an unlimited supply. in fact, I've postulated that the whole goal is to try and get the demand up to as high as possible.

as such, I don't really perceive it as a problem. the more demand, the bigger and better it is because that automatically craetes more supply. the tricky bit is finding a way to line up with that unlimited supply -- but, it's not really that hard at all. I just needed a few days to think about it I guess.

---

so then this morning, I also had another weird thing that happened where I went blasting off into a rant about how machines are not inherently evil and that it's likely a bigger picture of peeple with some really cool technology tryning to keep others away from it, so they remain superior. I used the example of the "worst" machines (torture devices and guns) as my example that the machine only extends the capability of the user, yet the machine is still used in a "good" or "bad" way as a reflection of the user -- not necessarily a reflection of the creator or even of the original intent of the creator for the machine. in other words, if you have a superiority complex, you'll use the machines to maintain your superiority, while other people may find the same machines to be quite a different nature.

right after that, I went down to read a document about the egyptians and in it is some of the oldest documents about the commnads that ptah gave to the egyptians, which is the egyptian version of vulcan. anyway, the commands are framed in such a way that it basically assumes that the person reading them is essentially a total barbarian -- stuff like, "treat your wife like property you actually enjoy, instaed of worse than your other posessions" (paraphrase). but, what was most surprising to me was how many commands were basically telling someone with a serious superiority complex to chill out. weird timing there.

I went to sleep and I woke up and I was thinking about a video I saw a while back about the implements of machines used by tyrants (@[yoputube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_wmxfYsGHo)), and even though most of the machines he cited there were said to have been created by ptah/vulcan, he mentions them as "the gods" (which is true in the case of pandora, it was zeus' idea, and all the other gods also contributed to her ills). the thrust of the video is that the tyrant wants to make some machine that is destructive (warfare or torture) and then inventors are rewarded with supplying the tyrant with their shiny new machines (eg. the inventor manifested the desire of the tyrant in the form of a machine).

anyway, later on I was thinking about this more and when I was taking a shower a idea popped into my head, which I explored a little bit. now that I think about it, it was probably a reaction a previous idea -- but anyway, what I was tsinking is that perhaps the gay thing can be connected to the whole ptah/vulcan thing because he was the one that implemented the "devious woman" (that gay men are so hurt over) into female psyche. I explored the idea that many men seem to fall into love with these beautiful creations, let their guard down, and then all of a sudden everything falls apart for them.

it's easy for me to see why this is, because if you're giving a whole lot of your attention to unwanted and then you begin to amp that energy up with sex or other esoteric practises to increase the chi/prana/vril energy in the person, then energy will move faster, so there are increased probabilities that unwanted will manifest (if that's what you're giving your attention to[^1]). there's no more powerful force, I think than sexual (chi, prana, vril) energy, and you simply cannot be "in love" and pushing against stuff you don't like at the same time. as abraham explained in the example of this was TLA and the girl that he couldn't figure out if he was in love with or just physically attracted to.

because they don't mix, when you amp up this energy with the most beautiful creations the stuff you're giving your attention to will manifest rapidly, and so likely a lot of men have found that girls/women to be the bane of their existence because they're increasing that energy and causing the unwanted stuff to manifest more rapidly.

so, when a guy like me comes along who I openly associated myself with vulcan/ptah (who made pandora), and yet for me the exact opposite happens that they have happen. when I'm around girls and that energy begins to flow more rapidly, good things happen and things get better and better.

this is exactly the same conversation that I just had this morning with jaron about AI where I said that if there are 10 people and 5 of them have AI, and AI is superior, then those 5 people will rapidly go extinct because new effective tools get adopted more rapidly than anything else -- claiming that if something as revolutionary as AI were to have fear associated with it, this is likely someone with a superiority complex trying to keep the technology a secret.

---

what that lead to was me thinking mixing these two concepts. mix the gay one with the superiority complex one, and you get the present situation where the absolutely *last* thing that they can allow to have happen would be to allow the girls thing to manifest. they can't allow it, because they probably want the same thing for theirselves, but the idea causes them tons of negative emotion, because they're not quite yet capable of increahsing their energy (with girls/women) and to give their attention to what they want. they want to still give their attention to what they don't want, which is why they're feeling negative emotion. this is likely what abraham was referring to in @[abe-now](2020-12-19 p2 59:59). these guys probably want to interface with girls (cause it feels so good), while at the same time giving their attention to all the stuff they don't want.

in order to get around this, they need to find a way to feel good. there's no other way around it. likely, if they want to keep their system going the way they want to, they'll need to figure out how to program the machines to keep up all of the tasks of pushing against the stuff they don't like, so they can begin to free their mind from more of those worries, giving the task of pushing against stuff more and more to machines. that's really the only way I can see it happening realistically. if they like the sensation of things in higher energy situations, they'll need to find a way to get their mind more and more off of the unwanted stuff.

I find that really unlikely though as they're total control freaks, and need to have everything under their control, so instead I find it much more likely that they'll directly interface less and less with low resistance people (like me and girls), as they don't want reality created too quickly that it gets out of their control.

I also find it likely that this problem will exacerbate in all ways because if they're jealous and petty about me receiving benefit from interfacing with low resistance people, and they have to keep me away from them -- this will likely begin to happen for more and more people. there's no way they're going to be able to allow *anyone* to be able to receive benefit from low-resistance people, as it'll challenge their superiority.

---

therefore we can now begin to understand why I wrote this in the first place. if nosebook has to keep people away from receiving benefit from other low-resistance people, then I find it likely that anyone who has a positive trajectory (less resistance over time) will have to be held down and prevented from interfacing with other low-resistance people.

now let's connect it all here: energy is rising in everyone, whether they want it or not. this energy amplifies how you feel, and therefore what sort of reality is manifesting around you. if you're giving your attention to a bunch of unwanted stuff, expect even more unwanted stuff that feels like that. interfacing (even conversation, not even necessarily even sex) with low-resistance people will accelerate that energy even further.

combine that now with my theories of the reality craetion organ of the body being the uterus/prostate[^1] and what you have happening is essentially, if you want to continue on giving your attention to unwanted stuf and have sex without all of that unwanted thought turning into reality, things will likely get more and more gay because nosebook can't allow people to create beneficial realities (penis/uterus) so they have to get rid of that. I think this'll happen naturally as a consequence of the deterioration of relationships as more and more unwanted manifests.

this creates a huge *imbalance*, where you will have an increase in demand (girls wanting to have sex), and a diminishing supply as more and more men decide to stay away from feelings of love (maybe prostitutes) so they can continue giving their attention to unwanted.

this is the only case I've really thought about, so far but as it comes to my attention, if there were a low-resistance man that was capable of maintaining his attention on wanted, these guys would be able to interface with high resistance women, and the women would create the realities in reflection to how they feel once they get their energy ramped up. this is kind of the situation I was seeing which I had a strong reaction to (which I couldn't figure out why). anyway, the reason why I didn't know why I had a strong reaction to this is because it jsut makes a stronger demand (and therefore more supply).

what you would have is three forces working to increase demand[^3]:
- (high/low resistance) penis -> (high resistance) prostate to incraese the space (so that enery does not condense too much)
- (low resistance) penis -> (high resistance) uterus to increasing reality creation in resistant women who feel they need someone to help them to find what their looking for in theirself.
- preventing (low resistance) penis -> (low resistance) uterus to continually increase their desire. the men they're looking for are "rare"
- (high resistance) penis -> (high resistance) uterus to manifest unwanted reality and therefore create more desire.
- (high resistance) penis -> (low resistance) uterus to cause the men who want to give their attention to unwanted, to desire even more to be think clearly (eg. TLA and low resistance girl)

the ones I have not thought about are:
- (low/high resistance) penis -> prostate (low resistance)

it seems like a good setup :)

[1]: I don't understand it fully, but it has some geometry concerns to it -- meaning that the angle between the angle between the "queens chamber" and the "kings chamber" determines the type of energy that is output[^2]. if you think of the penis/uterus angle, it's quite different to the penis/prostate angle, and it has a considerable diffrence

[2]: also related to my supposition that the great pyramid was an energy transmutation device which utilised this concept and essentially turned disharmoious frequencies into better ones utilising this angle. 12-6kya this allowed the atlantians to give increasingly more and more of their attention to unwanted and because the angle increases the space size, the manifestation of their attention to unwanted didn't happen. instead, it just used the energy to keep increasing the space (penis/prostate) instead of creating reaity (penis/uterus), and the atlantians were fine, until ~6kya things overloaded and the planet flipped over as a result. a similar overload is going to happen, but that's a different discussion.

[3]: when I say high/low resistance, I mean general trajectory of feeling better over time or feeling worse. this should be evident in their deviation from the mean energetic increase experienced across the whole set.

### 2021-01-16 02:22 - 2020-12-27 p1

#### (40:22) - the two poles (opposites)

as the question was asked I immediately thought "yes, wanted and unwanted" -- but they said "wanted and absence of wanted". it totally reminded me of this. a while back it was a huge realisation for me when I realised that the seemingly opposite sides of wanted and unwanted are not two opposite poles, but actually *four*.

there is wanted, absence of wanted, unwanted and absence of unwanted. wanted and absense of unwanted are so similar that they are hardly noticeable to people that there is a difference. as I'm writing this now I can see that "absense of unwanted" is more similar to "satisfaction", which is why it's so easy to go from satisfaction to wanted.

I have been wondering this for a while now, so typing this out is really enlightening for me because I had really been trying to figure it out. the real revelation is in looking at the opposite of wanted: absence of wanted or "unwanted". again, "absence of wanted" is pretty close to dissatisfaction, and actually it has a pretty wide range to it based on your perception. let me illustrate.

if I'm feeling absence of wanted, I can quickly jump to various different thoughts like,

- there's nothing here that I like
- everything sucks
- I hate everything
- blah, everything is meh
- nothing is interesting
- never goes the way I want it to
- it always falls apart like this

as I was writing them, I couldn't help but to notice that I used a lot of infinites: "everything", "nothing", "always", "never" in sentences and that is quite a bit diffrent than the similar version of unwanted, which is always specific to something:

- I don't like this/it
- I don't want it/this
- etc.

it appears that the difference between these two are the infinite versions. I noticed that I cannot help myself but to use infinte forms like a child does. I desire to have a language where I could express likelihood (belief) in a way intrinsic to the sentence, forcing me to define how much I believe what I'm saying[^1]...

instead, because I don't have an easy way to show how how much I believe something by intresically encoding the likelihood (of truth) into the concept[^2], I instead use infinitites like a little child.

however, what I'm seeing is the power of these infinitites because they show the two (hidden) opposite poles: the absence of wanted/unwanted. it's a very interesting idea :)

[1]: this idea actually after having thought about it, really adds a whole new dimension of dishonesty to language because now I can explicitely tell people I believe something I may or may not believe. well, whether other peoole use this feature to deceive theirselves or others is none of my business. I only want it to be able to communicate clearly with others.

[2]: the idea that popped into my head was veritasium logo: "an element of truth". though I could imagine it as an element, I like to think of it as a likelihood that there is an element of "truth" to the concept I'm conveying.

#### (45:31) - ... that needs to go through before it can be externalised

as they were talking about this question I was reminded multiple times of a realisation that we made last night. the idea of getting a vibration going so fast that it passes the escape velocity and becomes externalised is a somewhat valid one. I think this is a process that is evident all over the place, especially on the surface of the sun (eg. it's what produces the manifested solar wind particles/elements)

however, there's more to it than that. if we'll return a moment to last night's realisation: I explained that there is no way that this manifestation is happening because I would feel it coming. I'm quite intuitive and as reality is beginning to manifest, I can feel it coming. in fact, this is why I'm so sure that you navigate time with your emotions. if I weren't able to feel it coming, then it simply wouldn't ever come. I would having a case of split-energy or something where an equal amount of energy in harmony is happening as an equal amount of energy in disharmony to it is happening, giving the effect that I'm traveling away from it as fast as I'm traveling toward it.

in a previous entry I made the realisation that you feel good when you're either moving toward it or you're going faster in a direction not away from it. imagine a target and even if you shoot at the target 45(degrees) away from the target, from the perspective of the projectile, it'll feel like it's getting closer for most of the way, and that'll give the evidence of feeling good, yet at some point the distance will go from feeling good to feeling bad as the projectile now is no longer moving toward the target but away from it.

this may (does from my perspective) explain a lot of what happens in drug experiences, especially in relationship scenarios, the beginning feels really good because you're moving toward the target (the target is the position of your source in time as the culmination of all of your desires). however, because of the nature of the drug experience it's more like that projectile which will eventually go from feeling really good in the beginning because of increased speed, yet because the trajectory of the projectile was not on target, as was not aimed directly at the target and becsuse *the target is also moving*, it totally misses the target, and it'll gradually go from feeling more and more bad as the projectile (you) begins to actually get further and further away from the target.

the target is not a position in 3d space. because of the nature of frequencies and harmonics, it's more like a million or a trillion dimensions -- somewhere in there, so it's pretty easy to miss the target. it's also pretty likely that the intersection or impact can only happen at the 4 corners of the wave as well. so if we reimagine the frequency a bunch of parts so they are now orbiting bodies (like planets or atoms), then the intersection could only happen at the conjunctions, oppositions and squares. having knowledge of all of these periods and each of their angles while they're constantly changing seems quite a difficult problem to work out how to make the intersection happen.

back to the projectile and target visuals: obviously it's quite difficult to hit a moving target without infinite knowledge of the positions and trajectories of both the target and the projectile, so this is not ideal. instead, it's easier to thing of them as resonating bodies and allow them to attract/align or come into sync with each other. for as long as the target and the projectile are harmonic, they will continue to attract each other (eg. how they feel will become more and more similar until they find theirselves in the same space and time).

this is why I do not believe that anything is going to be happening anytime soon. I would feel it. I would know it.

you can also look at this from the opposite perspective too: I am a deliberate creator, and because I must know and have under control the things that are manifesting into my experiece based on how they feel, so while I continue to feel the way I want to feel, I *am* blocking the manifestation until I am the one that feels it and begins to attract it into my experience.

nosebook can certainly try and be selective of what I attract into my experience based on what they they want to allow me to feel, and therefore attract into my experience. I suppose a lot of things can feel good to me, and they try to control which are the exact things that I feel, so they can give preference to some things over others, but to try and speed something up so that it's forced to manifest will never work: as long as I'm deliberate with my creation, this is already disharmonic.

#### (57:11) - watch the broadcast less

the questioner asked what to do about the increased sensitivity, and to me this is an obvious case of finding a way to feel better about those diffeent things that feel so terrible. they used to tell people (back in 2016 and earlier) that they need to find a way to feel good about that thing causes them to feel bad.

this was so tremendously helpful to me because this was happening at a time when the andrea thing was still happening and I had to find ways to feel good about situations which were not going the way I thought they would. I remember I left la vera and I was riding on the bus on my way back to madrid and I was thinking to myself how simple it all is. all I have to do is to find a way to feel good about whatever is happening. if anyone remembers, you could consider that I was challenging or "testing" myself to see how much I really believed that because things once again deteriorated further on to my experience in madrid and I forgot this many times.

it was just so easy to get pissed off about all the stuff that was happening. it was plainly obvious to me the nosebook that was happening and I couldn't get anyone to talk with me about it and I really had a difficult time with how much effort there was to keep me in the dark and lie to me.

eventually, as I realised that no amount of action was going to make any difference, I had to simply decide that I wanted to feel good no matter the case. again, I forgot this when I broke a car window, but I remembered it again when I was in the hospital numerous times. I forgot it again quite a few times here in pueblo, but eventually with enough practise, I've got it. when my desire is to feel good no matter the circumstaces, I have all the power. I can feel how I want to feel.

it took a lot of time and practise to get there, but I'm telling you it's the most worth-it thing to know.

I think the reason they're not telling the questioner to find a way to feel good about whatever it is, is becasue they want the questioner to come to their own conclusion that they want to feel good, and there's *NOTHING* worth feeling bad about. I really mean it: nothing is worth feeling bad about, ever.

### 2021-01-17 03:46 - (2020-12-27 p2)

#### (26:56) - manipulating him with my book

as abraham was talking about writing a book about the woman's husband, they were saying "... and you *will* see him with an extra twinkle in his eye, ... etc." and while they were saying it, I could feel mr. motor reeling at how annoying it is for abhraham to be telling this woman what she *will* be doing and what will happen. as that was happening, he was clearly venting behind me about it.

after that they got to the next part after they said there are books (of positive aspects) she could write about him, they said, "and when you tune yourself in that way, you're not tuned to the other (honory version of him)".

let me back up a moment actually because I should explain the setup here. when I was listening to the question, abraham said, "get a book, like this:" [shows hands with finger sizes] and I see a book about that size that looks like one of those mini-bibles and I think it was like yellow or something. anyway, it was like one of those contact books that people had a while back. they said "do you see the book?" and I say, "yeah I saw the book" and they said something like "ok, you're going to fill it with positive aspects of this man" or something like that.. as they were saying it, someweird thoughts were passing through my mind about how I should write positive aspects about derek and stuff.

the context for this is I skipped over sending in the questionaire that they had for 10 aniversary on youtube a few times now, not for any particular reason, but because it feels forced. if it's going to happen, it'll happen just fine without someone pushing to try and make it happen. I feel resistance to it because it feels forced. it's probably not derek or anyone else's fault. it most definitely has the effort factor of nosebook all over it. it seems like they took my old comments a while back (other noseblog repo so I can't reference it) where I said that I liked how the events played out and unless something happens diffreent, I'll just go with the that. seems they've gone to quite a lot of effort to try and figure out how to get all of that under their control (or something). they wouldn't be pushing for it if they didn't think that they could have under their control (obviously).

before listening to this abe episode, I felt like writing @[noseblog](2021-01-16 22:17) where I had a strong feeling like there was a lot of "convincing" going on. for now, I'm just skipping their attempts to try and manipulate stuff into place...

that brings me right to the book of positive aspects here now, because after mr. motor's venting, the thought that enetered into my head is that *I* should actually make a book of positive aspects of mr. motor.

he's steady
he's predictable
he has an inner being
I know deep down he wants to feel good

---

so, I think it's a great idea to write positive aspects of mr. motor. I'm certainly going to do it. I had to use the restroom though and when I went up to do it, I was thinking about how I was getting the thought to write positive aspects of derek, but I was also feeling fernando and joy as well when I was getting the original thoughts. as I was peeing, I began to get a different sense, and that I should also add in ben as well.

I'll likely write positive aspects of the four of them. it seems like a good idea. anyway, as I'm writing this, I went from pretty blah feeling to now having one of the most intense caffiene highs I've had in quite a while. I haven't drank much coffee. I need to take a break for a bit. brb

### 2021-01-27 13:16 - (2020-12-27 p2)

#### (19:03) - why? because they feel better

this is something that doesn't work for me -- well kinda doesn't. a while back I had various difficulties with mom and nosebook (and other things too). I was sorta in one of those bad-feeling places, and there wasn't much anyone could do to help me. I felt at the time, terrible -- and there appeared like no one was able to help. it was all hopeless. I felt tremendous despair and stuff. at that time, I remebered that used to be able to just find nicer things to focus on and I would feel better, however, it was kinda like a very short drug high because it didn't last very long at all. the slightest thing would remind me of the enormous problem (which at that time was nosebook and what they were doing to me), and then that small reminder would send me right back into depression and rage. I eventually gave up trying to feel better and just decided I would be miserable for a while.

I can't raelly remember how long I stayed like that, but what changed it for me was realising that not anyone (nosebook, mom, etc.) was responsible for how I felt. the most empowering thing was realising that it's all attraction and that I was doing it all to myself.

so, sure some words feel better than others do, but no good-feeling words could have any lasting effect on how I felt. the real problem was that I was making someone else responsible for how I felt. when I started to take responsibility for how I felt, I got all the power back and the depression began to lift. every time the issue came up, I had a chance to find a way to take responsibility for how I feel, and that is so empowering.

the previous person wrote a whole slew of words as if the words were some sort of magickal incantation to summon that experience that they described with their words -- however, through the duration of it all, you could feel that the whole time they are wanting the beautiful man to jump out of the vortex and just make them feel all the ways that those words described.

in my opinion, these two letters are kind of like before and after shapshots into the progression of a relationship. one usually has a list of things the other person needs them to do to make them feel a certain way. the other often times is less action oriented and has a list of ways that the other needs to make them feel. in both cases, whether it's perceived as an action or some magickal presence they have which gets the other to the emotion they want to feel, both sides are making the other side responsible for the way they feel. inevitaably, when one fails to satisfy the other (cause it's impossible), then begins the things that we do to regain our power by taking revenge (feels better than depression) and finding ways to make the other feel the way you feel, which is powerless to feel the way you want to feel.

there are variations to this trope which involve wanting the other person to rectify, absolve, or save them from the way they feel -- but all of these variatios have the common factor that one person makes the other person responsible for the way they feel -- and it never works. it's literally impossible that it ever could work. it's like trying to get more than 100% efficiency out of a closed system; it's just not possible.

interestingly enough, they followed up that thought I just took issue with, by saying:

```
fundamentally, the only thing you can control is [how you feel right now].
you have the power of focus.

get determined that you're going to feel that way.
decide that you're going to feel that way
and then find words that amplify that you feel that way
until you establish a point of attrction that has some momentum going

...

will you relapse? of course you will.
will some days and subjects be easier than others? of course.

but, you must know fundamentally accept that it's attraction attraction attraction
and how you feel is your indication of where you are in this red-hot minute
```

get determined that you're going to feel the way you want to feel. that *is* where all of your power is. I stand as a living example of this. I cannot personify their words more. they are for real.

```
... in relationship to way your inner being feels
... about all of the things that your inner being knows you want
... of which your inner being is embracing and gathering cooperative componennts with the help of LOA and the focus of your inner being on every single one of those subjects
```

:)

#### (27:05) - you're manipulating him right into happiness

the last time I tried to write finish this, I only got to the 26:56 mark, when I started writing a section called "manipulating him with my book" -- but then I couldn't finish it. I suddenly became very bad feeling. if I had of continued on, I was only a few more seconds away from them answering the dominant reaction I was receiving of why did I title it, "*manipulating* him with my book"

```
you will become a cooperative component
abraham, is this manipulation? (they say as they look down appearing to have shame)
you're manipulating him right into happiness (and worthiness)
you're manipulating him right into loving himself (just like you're remembering how to do)
```

lol. well, it turns out that was about 10 days ago, and it seems to me that the very sick feeling I felt must have been him (mr. motor) realising that I would "manipulate him right into happiness". since I didn't return back to listening to it because I felt too much resistance, I instead continued on to begin to understand the way that brain interprets the feeling of a presence or absence of something. I don't think mr. motor wants to feel happiness -- which is alright. I'm not at all bothered by that. that would require him to identify the way he *does* want to feel, and right now he only wants to be concerned with the way he doesn't want to feel. again, perfectly alright. so instead it appears that between these two sessions, we instead were beginning to lay the groundwork for me to realise that it's possible to feel the "absence of the way he doesn't want to feel" instead of the "presence of the way he does want to feel." -- allowing him to, with the inversion of the feeling of presence, achieve a similar result.

it's actually quite a good thing to realise and it totally opened up a whole lot of new ideas on this because of how useful it is and a better understanding of how satisfaction works. I'll probably return to it in the future cause it's such a powerful new concept for me.

anyway, lol :) it's not manipulation; it's calibrating

#### (29:16) - after a month of writing in your book

it struck me as weird the words that they used here. they went out of their way to say the word month.

```
there are no case so hard that you can't align yourself
fundamentally, predominantly with their positive aspects
and there is no one who is unreachable to feeling better

some things will happen.
you'll be you, the new you, who you've practised being becsuse *you've been writing for a month in your book*
and they'll keep being them
but they'll be more like the you, you're describing
and less like they that they used to be, every day that you write in your book

try it
```

well, I mean I don't know here. I was thinking that I should begin the book today but I've kept feeling resistance to things, so I haven't done it. I was also thinking about this full moon coming up tomorrow. I feel like it has something to do with this, because I watched a thing on it (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbbxzaT6KTM)), and I remmember athen said words that really stuck out to me of it being a start of a new cycle. I relise that he probably says those words at least once every video, but they really stuck out to me. I don't really like mixing LOA and astrology much. usually I enjoy looking at the astrology meaning/interpretation *after* the event instead of before (it's always more meaningful to me in hindsight[^1]), however this one I actually noticed the words before. usually I don't really pay much attention to the words because I really have found that those words are a great way to build up a huge imagination and therefore expectations around some event.

I think the reason why I was thinking of the astrology thing was the connection to the moon and the specific "month" word used by abraham here.

it's interesting to me because my internal reaction to these sorts of things is actually the opposite: "a month, huh? what if I wait at least a month before I begin to write in my book, huh? then what :)" I'm sort of like that. I like to test LOA and see how it stands up.

plus, I'm just not very into the idea of manipulating other people. I've come to know the power of my own attraction in such a way now that I kind of *want* people to be ornery around me. I give them full permission to do whatever they want to do. I don't want to try and influence (or mnipulate) them in any way. I'll be the one that's master of my perception and responsible for how I feel. I don't need him or anyone else to be happy or worthy for me. preferably, they don't so I get even more practise :)

call me masochista, but I love antics. the most influential people in my life were the ones with the most antics. I had and still have quite a few antics of my own. it's what makes me individual, unique, and fun. I want others to be that way too, and all antics are fine. I'm responsible for how I feel, so that means we can laugh at each other's antics. just let it all hang out, right? dad used to laugh at me a lot. he would often tell me, "I'm not laughing at you; I'm laughing at your *antics*" -- a very powerful concept. or, "it's not you; it's your *antics* I find [insert word]" :)

I guess we'll have to find out what happens.. heh :)

[1]: actually, when I first started astrology, it was very attractive to me because I could feel some of the planetary energies that they would say, but not all of them. I found out my first problem was I was listening to mainstream astrology which is way off. I switched to vedic and I still felt a little more in relation to the signs and learned asbout the north/south node (rahu/ketu), but still wasn't working for me. at the same time I was also doing abraham stuff. I would listen to the astrology and get all kinds of crazy ideas of what I thought would happen based on what I wished to happen. it's basically a pure "paja mental" of expectation because of all of the abstract words. I noticed that the more ridiculous my expectations were, the less they turned into reality. I recognised it as a kind of the same effect of overly optimistic and unbelievable expectations as I had when smoking weed, so I began to look at them more from the retrospect and begin to correlate what did happen to what the astro prophecy said would happen. I grew up in the prophetic church movement so I recognised that more of it had to do with my own belief, than the idols or rituals performed. the idols or rituals were just a way to get me to believe in something, but ween't te belief itself[^2]. instead, now I'm beginning to realise that LOA is much stronger than any astrology forcast (either good or bad). next, I began to notice that as I used LOA instead of astrology, the events in my life seemed to correspond to the events happening astrologically. now, I'm going beyond that. let's see if I can transcend all of the forces and make comments like these :) I have a feeling astrology is a lot like perception: it's the perception that's the presence, not the subject (kinda like, "the medium is the message [not the subject]")

[2]: it's like the gambler who believes he's lucky, but because he was carrying a rabbit's foot, *that* must have been the charm that made him lucky, not his own perception of himself. later on when gambling with the lucky rabbit's foot at first he appears more lucky than normal, but then it tapers off to where he now appears unlucky. he then wonders maybe it had to do with something else. the luck always appears external to him. it may never occur to him that the lucky rabbit's foot only was a good method to boost his belief when he actually believed in it, but then his own doubt caused him to begin to pull the rubberband back again instead until another lucky moment, where this time he will now believe again it was something outside of himself to make him lucky. two things are needed for luck: tesion/desire, and for that that desire/tesion to overcome the resistance to the lucky moment.

### 2021-01-29 00:23 - (2020-12-27 p2)

#### (05:12) - go to something, not from something

earlier when I was writing @[noseblog](2021-01-28 22:32), one of the things that I was spliting my energy over was to appreciate openly or not. just before this, they advised the questioner saying that appreciation "is the dominant focus that you want to give as you're being called to your new place".

then, the said that they wanted to remind them to "go to something, not away from something". now, I don't really feel like I'm going away from anything specifically, it's just that I refuse to go toward things that I feel uneasiness over. they also say, "make a decision and line up with it" along with "if it's not a 'hell yes', it's a 'hell no'" -- so putting those all together, I'd have to say I'm rather split. as always, when split, don't make any action -- so I won't (obviously).

I actually don't know why I felt inclined to stop here, because I don't feel any bit like I'm going away from something.

#### (19:45) - will you relapse? of course you will.

as they were talking in this section and the previous one I was remembering all of the different times it took me to finally get what they're saying. it really was quite a while and took quite a few attempts before I really started to get it. in fact, it would appear that at the beginning I was getting *worse* at it, not better. that was actually because the energy was stronger, and it made me more detedmined than previously, and when they were talking about being determined it reminded me of that. it's really quite strange how many tris it took me. there were just so many *valid* and *good* reasons for why I should be pissed off at something, and it wasn't fair that I had to be the one who decides to give up on the fight. it really was the most difficult thing, but once I finally got it into my head that I'd rather feel good than to be right about the injustice, that's when it finally started to get easy.

as I was writing this, I was reminded of a similar concept which also opened some new doors of non-resistance for me which was the inversion of that idea: "I'd rather be wrong than to feel bad." sometimes when we're wrong about something it stings a bit, and it stings because I'm not able to allow myself to be wrong. for as long as I don't want to be wrong, I feel bad. however, the moment I decide I'd rather be perceived as wrong than to feel bad, I gain a tremendous freedom. at first, it appears that this is almost exactly the same as "I'd rather feel good than be right" -- but it's slightly different because sometimes it can happen that if someone does not agree with you, they try to make you feel bad (regardless of whether they really are right or wrong) because your opinion differs from theirs.

the bible credits jesus with this expression in the form of "agree quickly with your adversary". personally I like, "I'd rather be wrong than to feel bad." a littte bit better. over time, I've noticed that I don't really notice people trying to make me feel bad so much anymore. they're usually trying to make me feel bad from a place of their own insecurity, and the only reason why it works is because I too resonate a little bit on insecurity (which usually comes from caring too much about what people think about me).

#### (36:57) - I want to be connected to source and see what source sees

I find this statement to be weird. as I'm beginning to write I'm maybe understanding why, but from my perspective, I see the same thing that source sees, or rather they see the same thing that I see. we see the same thing. the part that can be different is the perception bit. the eyes translate the vibration into colours and shapes, but the vibration is the same. we "see" the same thing, but the way they interpret it and the way I interpret it is different. the difference between how we perceive the same thing can be *felt*. when I see something the same way source sees it, it feels good regardless of what it is because *everything* and I really do mean everything has a positive aspect to it -- and it's only a big enough picture of the transformation of energy which allows the most "difficult" things to be perceived as something positive. it takes a bit of a knowledge of the energetic and viibrational nature of things, to be able to perceive this, but in all cases you can build this knowledge easily simply with the feedback on your perception: if it doesn't feel good, it's not resonant with that knowledge, which means you're believing in bogus stuff like death or metrics or finalisation or something which doesn't exist.

it's kind of crazy to say that quite literally the knowledge of the understanding of how everything that exists can be learned with emotional feedback, but that's what I'm saying.

I don't want to see things like source sees them, because the limitations of my eyes will never compare to the the way they can "see" the same thing (infinitely more detail). instead, it's my ever consuming desire go be able to *perceive* things like source does. seeing is physical interpretation but perception is feeling the same way source does about the same thing.

HUGE DIFFERENCE which, in my opinion, is quite substantial.

### 2021-02-03 22:21 - (2020-01-02 p1)

#### (48:23) - looking for positive aspects in the moment

as they were talking about this idea after telling the story of esther with her camera, I was thinking about how so many photographers get so much joy out of photography, not necessarily for the photos theirselves, but more for the focus that the camera beings to the situation. by wanting to take a picture, the photographer is attracting more unique and lively situations, and so therefore they are more likely to happen -- cept, perhaps if you have split energy about missing the shot, then perhaps that will be what happens. however, it seemed quite a revelation to me how just pointing a camera at something increases the LOA intensity.

from that, it's easy to see now how a camera is quite a useful tool to bring out the positive aspects in the situation. I suppose it could also work the opposite way though too. the other day I was thinking about orwell's 1984 book where the brotherhood inspires people to search for (attract) misconduct in others and to report it to the brotherhood so that their behaviour could be punished appropriately. it's pretty obvious how this could easily become a way for nosebook to train their AIs to detect undesirable behaviour while at the same time keeping people away from the only relationship that really matters: the one with myself.

this concept is interesting to me for a number of reasons because it's the opposite of what ahraham is explaining above. in orwell's vision, people would be focused outwardly, not very unlike the world we live in today, with the intended purpose of keeping them externally distracted (internally unfocused). the idea here is that if you are focused externally all the time, you never focus inwardly, which is caring about how I feel instead of adjusting my behaviour to conform to how *I think* other people outside would react to me.

---

it's easy for me to see hor important it is to be inwardly focused and to care about how I feel (usually only doing the things I feel like doing). however, this image that abraham is presenting is an entirely new concept for me. it sort of paints a different picure because they are saying that by focusing your camera, combined with my desire to take a good picture, then LOA causes that desire to manifest pretty rapidly. the method by which this is effective, is that I am looking for positive aspects in that moment and so by lookiny for positive aspects, I see them (unless my expectation is otherwise).

so, let's look at what this would accomplish if this were exploited by nosebook: imagine nosebook were to (secretly) give a bunch of nosey people access to other people's lives, and then nosebook could use the nosey people's reactions to those other people's lives as a classifier to an AI for recognising undesirable behaviour.

it depends on the nosey people. imagine the nosey people (this is the symbolic moment of pointing the camera) were looking for tons of of super hot sex. well, exactly that would be much more likely to happen, just because of the camera effect of LOA. they are "looking for positive aspects". therefore, the only way for orwell thing to work would be to have people specifically looking for undesirable aspects/behaviour[^1]. therefore, in that sense, if nosebook wants to attract more undesirable behaviour from people, they would need to get people in the frame of mind that they need to look for and expect to find undesirable behaviour. however, since it's not likely to be very enjoyable (unless you're a very sadistic person) to watch, for example, someone beat their wife through the eyes, or experience it from the perspective of the victim either, this is probably not ever going to be a thing.

instead, allowing people to see through other people's eyes, would actually only really have the effect of attracting more desirable things out of their experience[^1] -- in the long run. the reason I say in the long run, because of the aforementioned negative response to actually experiencing undersiable aspects/behaviour from the perspectice of the victim/perp. additionally, I believe again, in the long run, that if nosebook were to implement something like this, then the undesirable bits that the photographer could could attract into the experience of the camera or the situation, would actually cause people to have much stronger internal focus and much less concern over how others perceive them. the reason for this is obvious.

in general, even analysing the worst possible situations, I believe it's a good thing. at worst, I think that this form of external focus (as opposed to social media) would result in stronger internal focus (after a bit of a bumpy ride as people get used to the increased speed it provides) -- and that actually in general it would greatly cause people to practise their focus on positive aspects[^2]

[1]: wait, the reaction I'm getting is that this has been done, yet disaster resulted. I dunno.

  maybe it has something to do with the "camera". there really are only three moving parts in this situation: the person looking through the camera, those in the scene, and the camera itself. in normal life, only two of these matter because the "camera" is not a conscious entity. this must be the determining factor. I'll have to think about this more. I also don't have enough data to say one way or another.

  so, say for a moment that it's a simple situation of a father looking through his son's eyes. the son doesn't know that his father has access to his experience, let's say. it must have something to do with the photographer's expectation. I've often wondered how some people have gotten so many terrible or tragic pictures, yet others seem to get lots of great ones. I suppose it's because the expectations are greatly influencing the camera.

  speaking from my own experience on this one. I noticed a lot of times, especially in relation to drugs, I felt extra compelled to do certain things I didn't ever previously feel such a strong desire to do -- like say smoking a "floor joint" or something. especially in spain. I think the expectations of the photographers greatly influence the camera and also the situation being recorded -- that is, until the person is so solid in theirself that it doesn't really make much difference. they are more concerned about how they feel internally. this is further evidence of the conclusion that I'm getting to above.

[2]: which, I think is actually a whole lot more effective if nosebook is actually trying to hide stuff. it's your basic magician principle: keep the audience's attention on the shiny attractive thing, so they don't see what the magician is really doing.

#### (50:21) - narrow vision

I ave had a difficult time hearing what they have been saying. I have repeated the last 5 minutes 3 times now. I have a feeling there may be a reason for it. anyway, this last time, when I was listing, they were saying something like, "no matter how broad or narrow your vision is"... and I got a picture of mr. motor.

so, I was thinking about how giving them all of this tecnology (even temporal perception) for them is still trying to do the impossible. I titled the entry, "driving forward by looking back into the front-view mirror" because it's trying to navigate into the future by looking into the past. when looking into the rear-view mirror the experience is much different than looking out the windshield because it's so much smaller. this is what I was seeing is mr. motor trying to navigate his way forward looking back into the front-view mirror. because it's so small it's hard to do effectively. what's the solution? look into the front-view mirror with a pair of binoculars. duh...

in a past entry @[noseblog](2021-02-02 18:37), I was trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to continue on with the discussion I had in the previous entry about how no matter how much power or control the brotherhood gets, they will never actually get the control they are wanting to have. you can't get to a future where you feel the presence of control, by feeling the absence of control the whole way.

therefore, I concluded that we should throw as many different forms of technology at the brotherhood as they can make use of, because they will never actually get what they're trying to do. it's absolutely 100% for-sure impossible for them to get. the only way they could get control would be to actually find a way to *feel* the way they want to feel, and therefore travel through time toward the realisation of that feeling. the feeling of control means that they will have completely control over their reality (which is a reflection of how they feel), so if they were to find their way to having control, it would be because they feel control -- which is the ability to feel the way they want to. see what I'm saying? if they can feel the way they want to, then they can feel all the control they want to feel, which is the ability to feel the way they want to. it's a circular definition of itself. if they only knew the control they seek is of their own emotional one, then they wouldn't try so hard to get control their externals.

in other words, they they can't ever gain control, and no matter how hard they try to get full physical control, emotional control *always* trumps physical control. this is exactly what they're saying here:

```
teach yourself, your ability to focus yourself into pleasure no matter how broad or narrow your view is in this moment.

and what you will como to see -- is that, like this camera lense that esther can zero-in or pull-back, that you have the ability to be as broad in your view or ar as narrow in your view -- and in *all* of it, there is the potential, the capacity, for indescribable pleasure.

we can't make you believe that, but we want you to. it is our expectation for you, and when it is yours -- the deliciusness of your life will be indescribable.
```

so here's what I mean: imagine that you have a whole bunch of physical circumstances that are completely out of your control. consider that in the worst case you do not even have control over your vision. you may be very broad or narrow in your physical focus, however, what you experience emotionally is what really matters and it is far more powerful than the physical. as they say, the more I teach myself my ability to focus myself into pleasure (emotion) no matter how broad or narrow my view is in the moment, then -- no matter the physical focus, what will eventually happen is that the "deliciusness of your life will be indescribable".

I say eventually, because it takes time and practise, but more than that focus is about momentum, so it takes some time. consider the 17 second rule. the longer you focus a feeling in a certian way, the more you attract a similar thought or reality that matches it. it takes conscious effort to get there. the conscious effort is the focusing bit, so it takes time.

---

what emerges here is a picture where on one side you have this brotherhood that wants to try their hardest to achieve something that is 100% impossible for them to achieve. what they can do is to make it really difficult to get there though, thereby extending the 17 seconds out to days months or years of cumulative focus before the thing manifests. the length of focus and the resulting manifestation is likely a caculatable thing if we were to have sufficient technology. however, it is almost certain that the brotherhood is here to stay, as a genius way to increase our capacity to focus and the indescribableness of our manifestations. certainly, it seems evident to me that marketing mr. motor to the masses will become a real thing.

### 2021-02-05 21:13 - (2021-01-02 p2)

#### (09:07) - you get tuned in anyway

they're talking about a hypothetical situation where you have to go to work and you have some sort of task that's assigned to you, and it's not really ringing your bells anymore, etc. the picture that I was getting in my head was the look that I often times noticed in the puticlubs in spain this very emotion on the  girls' faces there. they were just going through the motions cause that was how they get paid, and something that the used to like (sex) has now become a completely mundane and no longer enjoyable.

this reminded me of the entry I just wrote earlier today: @[youtube](2021-02-05 13:26), where I was talking about boneheads and how I think it's a bit of a mistake to just label the whole guy a bonehead, and not retain the positive aspect that he had when you first noticed him.

the thing about what I was talking about there about tuning into the person, is that it's easy for me to tune into where they are presently (empathy), but honestly, most people don't feel very good at all. most people are not showing the aspects of theirselves that I want to see. the thing about my style of thought is because I have the concept of "rip people off shamelessly", I'm always on the lookout for the next bit of someone else's personality I can copy and improve upon.

this means that without even knowing it, I am, by default, looking for positive aspects in them. this isn't always easy to do, but I would like to prove my point by showing that the technique itself is in fact, an improved version of what most of these custodial types are like. they are "sharks" in the sense that they go around looking for easy prey -- someone that they can take advantage of easily, and their whole thing is that all day everyday, they're constantly on the lookout for the next person that they can rip off or take advantage of.

I'm exactly the same way, cept when I say, rip people off shamelessly, I really mean it. I live by the golden rule in the sense that I do treat people like I want them to treat me. I actually *want* other people to take my ideas and improve upon them. when I first discovered this idea with open source software, it took me a while to get used to because I had such a high opinion of my ideas and didn't want people to steal them. by the time I got to augusto's house, I was certain that I wanted all of my ideas to be free. reason is, I noticed that as fast as I could think of ideas for other people, the next one would come right behind it. there was no reason to try and protect my ideas from theft, because I could think of new ones as fast as I could give them away.

it doesn't take much to realise that meant that no matter whatever the last idea was, it's the outdated one. the freshest version of it is just waiting for me to discover, and I noticed that it was always better. I kept up with that idea and continued to expand on it, fully embracing the "open source methodology".

from there, it's easy to see that when you aren't literally ripping a person off by taking something that they have physically, ripping a person off on somethin easily replicatable like software or ideas only furthers their expansion. I'm like the sharks out there, but I'm looking at how I can go around and copy from people the aspects that I like. sharks are good too in this way, because they're always on the lookout for something to take advantage of. basically, if you're interacting with them, they see something of benefit to them that they can get/take from you easily.

so, just like me, they too are also always on the lookout for positive aspects which they can take (advantage of) or utilise in some for for their advantage. so, even in the worst case, there must be at least some positive aspect that they recognise and want, otherwise they wouldn't be interacting with you. even if that positive aspect is, "they they I will make them feel better" -- that's good enough, because at the minimum that is the case.

it is never anyone else's job to make someone else feel better, so obviously this is a different situation in a non-work or task that's assigned to you sort of situation. we're talking about situations that someone didn't exactly choose (LOA says that from some level you always chose it). I can only really use myself as an example here, but in the case that someone wants to take something from me or exploit me in some way, that action of taking some physical energy from me always creates the double amount in non-pysical.

double is a pretty good bonus, so it's good to know how to get that back out. imagine that the situation was that someone drained your physical body energy. imagine that energy as flowing in a direction: toward you. however, then it gets redirected so that the energy instead flows to the vampire. I'm beginning to learn about charge separation, so imagine you have a material and you ionise it, such that the charged bits get separated +/- instaed of being neutral. then let's say they take a bunch of its energy, leaving it in the ionised state (He++ I think?). well, anyway, the original atom in its ionised state now really wants more of those electrons back, so it's going to be attracted to something that has electrons... I think that's how it works anyway. it doesn't really matter how the scientific bits of it work, because I don't see it as only difference of charges, because everything would just go toward becoming a clump instead of going toward order... I don't think I understand this fully because I think the reason why there's sometimes attraction and sometimes not is because it has to do with tuning. the atoms are vibrating at some rate, so they'll attract electrons which are vibrating similarly.

ok, back to tuning into people... it may seem obvious in such an extreme situation as the puticlub work situation, that it is a silly idea to want to actually look for the positive aspects in people, but what you are doing when you look for the positive aspects in people is you are tuning into the energy that was lost, and therefore attracting similarly vibrating energy out of non-physical. so if someone took your great idea, you used to have *presence* of good idea, and now you have *absence* of good idea. a bigger version of the idea now exists in non-physical and is similarly resonating. if you keep perceivng *absence* of the idea, that's not the same frequency as *presence* of the idea. therefore, it's all about finding ways to adjust your self (your body, mind, and beliefs) to begin to resonate with the presence of the idea again. when that happens, the idea will come back in a bigger more powerful way.

sure it's not fair that you do all of the aignment work and they benefit from it, but you benefit more from it. if they take 1 unit of energy, it creates 2 units in non-physical. let's say for argument sake that you can only find a way of tuning into 120% of it instead of the full 200%. there's still 80% of that energy remaining in your "vortex" and you still walk away with more than you started with (20% more). in reality that number is much higher because that process is happening multiple times per second, so much much more energy than that is being generated. so let's say that you can tune into the source version of them and line up with the energy that they have to offer (their positive aspects), then you could easily walk away with more than got taken from you. let's say they walk away with 100% and you walk away with 120%. pretty good. sure, the optimal would be to be in a work situation where both sides are contributing and taking, as that number would be higher, but because the situation is more desirable (wanted), it doesn't create as much of a non-physical "vortex" so say both walk away with 150% something...

the beauty, and the real advantage to difficult situations like this (where you're in a situation that has aspects which can be improved upon), is that it creates a lot of non-physical energy, and that energy (because of LOA) continues to grow even without you doing anything. it's like interest being generated. every time you cash that in for a manifestation, it contains wanted and unwanted so some amount goes back into non-physical.

so, yeah I find my alignment for *me* (so I can feel good), and certainly a lot of others benefit from that, but I benefit *way* more than they do.

btw, those calculations may not be correct. there are physical limits to things so let's say you have a good run and you get (110%)^100000 or something like that. it's a pretty big number, and certainly there is a point where too much pleasure becomes painful, so they're all relative to the situation and the person. for that reason it's good to have more interactions and make more decisions, even if you don't benefit right now in the moment from it. LOA makes it bigger and it comes back later or in a future lifetime or something. it doesn't go away, that's for sure -- but you have to find a way to tune into it to take advantage of it.

---

therefore, it's always to my benefit to find a way of tuning into the vampire/shark's positive aspects. a while ago when I was figuring out the whole nosebook thing, it was really annoying to me that *I* had to be the one providing them with so much great stuff and getting nothing in return. sure, they have, in a sense, continued to take away all of the physical presence of many things in my experience, but it's created a tremendous non-physical energy which I'm getting better and better at tuning into and converting into physical. it won't be long before I can tune into that massive non-physical energy reserve faster than they can take it away.

additionally, I must note that at the beginning it was hard, but it gets easier as time goes on -- a LOT easier. in fact, the more pressure was applied, the easier it's getting. so, there's really no problem with any of these vampires/sharks once you know how to tune into the non-physical result from the impact. actually, the more taken, the more is missing to get back to equilibrium, and so therefore more is asked for and more is given.

#### (27:59) - if you could activate within your vibration the positive aspects, you could stay replenshed no matter what anybody else is doing

> if you could stay in love, your energy would not be drained

repeating myself here, but I think the reason why they're only arguing that your energy would not be drained (eg. 100%) and not what I claim is that with these types of people, proper perception (focusing on their positive aspects and tuning in to (acquiring) the parts of them which are beneficial), then I claim that overunity can be achieved (eg. greater than 100%).

some people may not believe me. that's fine, cept my life should by now be a testament to that. I have barely to make any effort for vision upgrades anymore, and almoht nothing bothers me either. it really does get easier. the beginning is the hardest bit. hang in there though; you'll get it :)

### 2021-02-18 03:03 - (2021-01-09 p1)

#### (09:06) - people put concepts out there

> you ar asking so many questions like this, "why is this thing I want, not coming?" or "why is this thing I don't want, coming?" "why can't I get the things in my life that I want, and why are there things in my life that I don't want?"

this most sound familiar to many people because I don't raelly have much desire left anymore. I don't really have much of a response either to what is showing up either. in other words, I don't really react emotionally to stuff much anymore. whatever is there is just sort of there, and I know that it doesn't have much of an influence on the way I feel. I can feel how I want, dispite the conditions...

> the answer to that is that it's all attraction, but you don't have control over what you're attracting because you don't have control of what you'e thinking.

I often times get thoughts that pop into my head which I don't want to think, but Ihave to recognise that they are something that I am on the frequency of (tuned into something that feels similar). they follow up:

> the reason why you don't have control over what you're thinking is because you're mostly observing.

I can't help but to observe things. I've been thinking a lot about the "mmagick" of positive aspects now, which is to process to tune me to the positive aspects of someone, and not perceive the negative aspects. a bit ago I say bill gates laughing at the concept of facts. I suppose this could be perceived in a negative way considering the subject of rights of free speech and the covid vaccine, I wondered if I would have not noticed him smiling at the presentation of the facts if I were more positively aspect focused.

> ... here's the bottom line: you have been lead to believe, but because it's attraction, you've come to believe...

this always got me because I wondered how isit all attraction if they're seemingly asserting things into my life. this extends my supposition that DNA is a physical representation of a person's emotional state machine. what I mean is that by the very fact that I am percieving from this body, it means that I am resonant with it. well, the body is quite a dynamic thing with a wide range of feeling to it. when an infant is born, it'll have a large rush of DMT into its system, meaning that for that moment it is feeling quite good and is receptive of quite a good-feeling "soul". once the soul is trapped in the body, it can experience any of the emotions that the body is capable of feeling. it goes both ways so that a particularly bad-feeling soul could tune into the body at a bad feeling and then later experience quite good feelgs, and vice-versa.

because belief is based off of emotion, DNA must have something to do with how much propensity one has to a certain belief[^1].

> people put concepts out and you choose to focus where you focus, and whatever you focus on comes to you

this reminded me of what nosebook does to me. they put all sorts of difficult self-degrading concepts into my head, and if I didn't choose to perceive things the way I want to perceive them, I would focus where they directed me to focus.

it's possible to see how by nature my DNA would be much more resiliant to a lot of negative concepts. I think my DNA is very sicilar in that respect to the original atlantian DNA. if you were to put a very negatively focused soul into my DNA, the ESM that my DNA has would be quite resiliant to a lot of negative concepts, and I wouldn't get very tripped up on them.

---

so as they were saying this, I was reminded of this morning when I was waking up, the thought popped into my head, (something like) "just go with bill gates' vaccine and let them have it" (by them I'm referring to the sub-sahara africans) because at the time I could see that a lot of people suffering in africa was a whole lot of attention to bad-feeling concepts, and those concepts in the air which resonate with that (ie. the concepts that the covid virus and its vaccine tune the person to) will suddenly cause a whole lot of people to spiral quickly to their deaths. if this were to happen to quite a few africans all at once, there would be a whole lot less bad-feeling people on this planet, and so quite suddenly the whole planet would feel much better than it does right now and energy would rise quite quickly.

so sure, let them have it, and the ones that can survive that resonation with those kinds of bad-feeling concepts will remain living while the rest who cannot will essentially go extinct. the whole planet will feel much better and much higher energy. obviously I was being sarcastic, because they're not interested in things getting better feeling. they need the africans to continue to suffer so that thse planet doesn't feel too good. just imagine if all of a sudden everything felt better -- I would almost immediately get connected and they wouldn't have much they could do.

I'll let them figure out what to do. I'm just the messenger. this is consequently antoher reason why I don't have any difficulty taking the vaccine. sure it's a DNA mutation which tunes me to a whole lot of terrible feeling things (not unlike what nosebook is already doing). however, my own perception converts this bad-feeling into good-feeling. for me, the vaccine would be "just more energy".

[1]: the other day I postulated that sub-sahara africans were specifically designed with propensities toward certain beliefs.

#### (11:25) - it souds like they're talking about me

> I wasn't really interested in the silly game

> I already know how it works because I've seen things come to me before

these were my exact thoughts on the game they're talking about. as I continue to listen, the sense that I'm getting begins to shift from the game they're talking about, to a description of the present moment in regard to the girls.

although I have a few engries in a-list from january, it's been since about christmas that I've had some resistance to playing the game of identifying with little resistance some desires and then watching them effortlessly come to me (eg. writing entries in a-list).

> what you really felt is that it was beneith your knowledge level. you knew more than this game was showing. you knew more than this game was showing.

now, we're back to the game they're talking about. these were my exact thoughts. duh, things that I have a soft desire for come easily.

> in any event you had resistance about playing the game so you didn't play it.

now, we're back to talking about the a-list. I just stopped playing the game entirely. I felt waayyy too much resistance about it, and I just stopped writing in iht for a while.

> then, since we persisted (and the broadcaster/nosebook too), you gave in to it.

talk about persisting. there was considerable effortc on nosebook's part to get me to keep playing the game. I think when I add more to the list, it dilutes the desire (and therefore the energy) a bit and what happens is it makes it easier for them to manage keep things under control. basically, adding more desires to the list adds energy, but because it's not focused energy, it still has time to get into alignment. therefore, the longer I go adding, it adds more energy but at the same time it also keeps it a little longer time from manifesting.

I've known this for a while now but things have changed. I think nosebook has ween using this as a time buffer, and mr. motor has been pushing against it manifesting for a while now. however, recently he's switched his focus to now try and get it to manifest. at the same time he swiched his focus to get it to manifest, I don't want it to manifest. it's kind of funny how it works.

a few days ago, when I was watching JP, one of his videos reminded me of stephen colbert, which was the missing bit I needed to remember so I planned on writing the a-list yesterday, but instead I had to sleep some ridiculous time. instaed I decided I would write it after listening to abe-now. so they're speaking from my decision, not my action, which is why they're saying that I gave in to it. I'll be doing it later.

> in other words, sometimes it feels to you like the path of least resistance is just to give in, "oh all right, I'll play this game". ... so you split-energetically played the game (even though you didn't want to).

before anyone jumps to any conclusions, they're saying that I decided to go path of least reaistance to playing the game -- yet, it still feelas like quite a lot of reaistance to me. later as the story continues on, *later on* the person receives a whole buncs of 4-leaf clovers after having reluctantly playing the game.

> if you're not sincre with the universe when you're asking about something, don't be surprised when it doesn't come.

what they're saying is that I still have split energy about the game. kinda yes and kinda no (lol). I have lined up with the decision and I'm not opposed to it, but clearly there is still a lot of resistance and so therefore I simply don't mind that it's not coming yet.

### 2021-02-18 13:40 - (2021-01-09 p1)

#### (11:44) - evaluate the positive aspects of the game

they are suggesting that I line up with the decision. I have. I'm fully on-board with it, but there is kind of a bit of a hangup for me. I keep feeling like nosebook is trying to use the girls as a distraction for me -- to sort of keep me busy. I have a huge difficulty with this because this because I actually thke this thing a bit seriously in that I want it to actually be meaningful. I'm not sure that meaningful is the right word, but just go with it for now. I'm gonna kind of talk it out here.

to understand what I mean, I just don't feel ready quite yet and the reason why is becasuse I'm just now beginning to see the bigger picture. as I mentioned in @[noseblog](2021-02-18 03:12), I am seeing how important it is for these guys to have all the capablitity that they can possibly get to be able to try and hold back humankind's manifestation for as long as posssible. not just my own manifestation but if they're capable of doing this for everyone that really is quite a great thing. in the next exodia human installment I will begin to explore the transtemporal characteristics of the setup, because in essence, they will have to separate us from each other, each in their own timeline, which then given a full dose of needing not the manifestation, everyone (and I literally mean everyone) can become the star of their own timeline. there really is no limit to this. I describe myself as having figured out a way of tuning into the "afstest particle in the universe" and I also talk about how my entire goal is to "get into the centre" where I continue to tout the advantages of continuing to increase in frequency, but not amplitude. all of those figures of symbol are just a funny way of being "source-like" -- nothing more. they jsut sound super cool and more powerful, cause most people associate "source" with a condecending repetative woman with funny figures of speech (no offense esther!).

what I mean is, now that I've figured out the source aspect to jesus', and the other fire gods' scheme through history (whether they knew it theirself or not), and how this revelation of the bigger picture fits into the "forshadowing" of my predicted result that by the end of the next era the custodians (who are one era behind) are going to begin to "resist not evil" (push against the things they don't want) and how it fits into the much bigger picture of marketing mr. motor as a personal trainer and capturing that essence, turning them into artificial intelligences with desire, which then gives us the ability to really show off our brilliance as we use the AIs to construct the most resiliant and powerful species in a similar method to the way the custodians helped us to learn LOA, we can really make some absolutely brilliant species and put them in the most oppressive situations fathomable and watch how they perform, even jumping in ourselves to the more and more impossible dojos we can come up with. it all sounds so exciting to me. that's a really really long-term goal (someone has to dream big, right?)

the important first step is to make sure these guys get the most draconian and oppressive capabilities possible to give them, to ensure that we really turn out more than just "godlike" -- I'm talking like waaayyy more powerful than that. I also have an idea of how out of all of this will emerge the "exodia human". so, what I'm saying is that I can see is that the important part. the part I don't yet see is if that can be done at the same time as the girls thing is happening.

for example, for some reason there has been growing desire in me to "prove myself" by building a pyramid. this falls right into the latest stint that I had with competition when I wanted to play hearthstone. I normally don't ever feel the need to prove myself. this has never been a character trait that I've ever had, but I really think that it's sort of one of those things which I just don't mind to do. once I'm connected, I'm sure I'll have a visual capacity and the ability to create all sorts of automated tasks. it shouldn't be too difficult at all to figure out a super sweet design for a pyramid.

speaking of soft desire, I already put out the soft desire on that one. I made a small spreadsheet with some cool dimensions, and then I wanted it to be based on the trident symbol (psy) because I really like psiloPSYbin mushrooms, and it seems like a super cool constant/relation that has to do with the 5d mental/cenceptual layer, and I just think it would be really cool to make some sort of asymmetrical architecture out of some of these dimensions. I've also been giving light desire to other "weird" ideas too like I was thinking instead of it being an outward curvature shape, maybe instead it could be a curving inward shape. I really have liked the "pantheon" archigture, and I wanted to make something that uses frank chester's asymmetrical shapes to build a centre-directed implosion, which then reflects outward multiplied by some size to be a 5-fold shape.

I've also had this desire to figure out how to make a 5-sided shape, too. I know it's "impossible" in the traditional sense of the shape, but for some reason it's been something that I've wanted to do. I have a feeling like it's edges are straight, but it's faces are curved or something like that[^2]...

anyway, so many of these things are just wanting to get explored by me. I know it feels weird to want to do any of those things when there are girls with expectations and stuff, but quite frankly I none of the girls thing feels good to me right now. it's specifically designed so that it isn't going to feel good to me. nosebook has been perfecting their technique to try and make the things they don't want me to be doing to feel bad (which is fine because I'm not really worried about that anymore. I'm in a pretty low state of non-resistance). they also make anything that I do want to do to feel bad as well, which is sort of the problem. they are constantly pushing against me to try and figure out a way for me to not be doing any sort of maths or sciences, and I suppose it has been making me want to do it all the more.

another thing that is quite a difficult is that they keep pushing me to try and avoid drugs[^1], but it just keeps wanting me to do them more and more. I don't really want to do them with other people though. I want to actually have the time to really explore my inside. that's where all the magic is at. they keep trying to get me to focus externally on girls or whatever and I'm just not interested. I mean, I am interested in the girls, but there are jsut so many of them: literally slightly more than half of the planet are girls and I don't have any ability to even explore them. nosebook doesn't want me to gain any connection such that I can experience myself or anyone else without resistance, so for me it's sort of like "what's the point man". you could offer me whatever you think I would want, and I'm still going to hold out for the non-resistant connection to who I really am (source).

that said, when it comes to the positive aspects of the game, I can perceive many. I am fully on-board with continuing to play the game, and I think it has so many really great positive aspects to it.

in a sense, I'm kind of setting myself up to continue on going on without any manifestation for as long as I keep playing the game. I guess the plan is just to keep playing the game and just let it keep building up. at some point I suppose I have to, like the questioner does, stop playing the game and forget about it so that it can manifest.

---

so to look at the positive aspects of it, if I just keep playing the game I get to keep imagining and feeling so many great things with zero effort. I really do like that. the other major positive aspect is that for as long as I'm contiuing to do that, not only is the manifestation becomong more and more desirable, but at the same time it's giving more and more girls a chance to actually practise noticing what the results of their thoughts and feelings are. finally, I do have all of the control. I can stop playing the game at any time and forget about it all.

[1]: the other night I had a dream where I was in a church with a little girl with a grey shirt and she was pulling me around directing me where I should go and stuff, just like nosebook has been practising to try and ensure I don't do any of the stuff they don't want me to be doing. a guy comes up to me and tries to get me to smoke a few rocks with him. I rapidly decline. there's no way I'm going to ditch the good-feeling girl in grey (I couldn't figure out where she was when he was asking me the question) to go hang out and smoke a few crack rocks with some chungo looking guy. no thanks. the last thing I want is to do drugs with people around. all anyone does around me when I'm stoned is interrupt my train of thought as I get higher and higher up in moment of extasy. I'm tired of distractions. I may still smoke weed with people, but when it comes to drugs, at this point I want to do them by myself from now on. I realise that everyone can see everything going on any anyway, but that's not the point. it's the distractions that I keep having to try and get around and I jsut don't want to have meaningless conversation with a crackhead when I've got a caspability that I don't normally have to figure out more of me. I want to explore my inside. nothing of value is out there: not girls, not programs, not even drugs. everything I'm looking for is inside.

[2]: I just don't know what it would look like, but I have been deeply facinated with a shape that frank showed that had 3 wings that looked like blades and he said that out of it all of the asymmetrical shapes could be found. it felt to me like a "master" shape. what I want is something like that. I want it to be something that isn't anything but is at the same time everything that's possible. I don't know why I want to find this. it feels like

#### (12:49) - what you put into your vortex is never forgotten

the way that I interpreted the idea of forgetting about the game was that I would become so enthralled with something like my visual capacity or being able to fly and explore the planet once I get connected, that I would completely forget about the whole thing entirely. I could definitely see that happening because for example if I go somewhere with a tv, I tend to watch it and am completely sucked into it visually and it's hard for me to pull myself away from it. when I get my imagination, I can only imagine how compelling it will be to just sit and play with shapes, construct scenarios, let them play out, create new creatures and watch them interact with other creatures. construct new buildings, play with frequency, electricity, water, chemistry, etc. there are so many things to explore and discover. I would almost certainly forget abouh the girls in that situation. I can't say for certain, but I imagine it would be pretty rich environment to explore, but I do think that I'll quickly get bored and want to begin to bring some of those ideas to life in phyiscality.

the other way to look at it too (another positive aspect of continuing to play the game) is that for as long as I continue to play the game, I've begen to notice that things that I give my attention to begin to manifest faster and faster. as long as that keeps up, there is a literal limit to that because even though I don't have access to my manifesttion in my imagination space, the things that I give my attention to will manifest in real-time in 3d space. I'll have all of the capabilities of my imagination, but in 3d space. I guess that's kind of way better. I think it may be worth waiting for actually, because instead of just imagining the thing, I'll have a 3d physical version of it to play with. instead of trying to imagine stuff, I could skip the whole visual process entirely and do what I do best which is letting the feeling manifest in 3d space.

think about how much more awesome is that. I don't even need to design the pyramid. I just feel the components that I described above until they begin to take form. then, once the feeling has manifest, I would begin to explore it and find out how awesome the thing is. imagine that as a party trick :) I can create geometric and mathematical aspectst that have not yet even been discovered yet, but I could feel (source knows about them thuogh which is why they're possible).

yeah. ok, so I like tsat idea a lot. I really think the instant manifestation in 3d space is something I want to go for, and I also like that the girls too will be so much better at it all. it could also be good for the original goal of trying to give nosebook as much capabilitity as they can have to keep everyone down. they'll probably peace out about the time that I get the instant manifestation capability, but I'm not sure. they could also stay too for as long as they can hold on for (see previous discussion on DNA) because they're going to need the practise to get their DNA modification capabilities to make a timeline per person more fasible. also, if I'm manifesting stuff in 3d space, I'm not seeing my imagination, so they can continue on operating in "secret" inside of my imagination space without a problem. my creation space won't be my imagination. it'll be real-life reality 3d space. I'll make things as fast as I can think/feel them. that's pretty cool, yeah. so I'm pretty sold on the idea now. I'll gladly keep playing the game.

---

oh, another thing: it also solves the problem that I have with my physical body. I don't want to say that everything is failing, but certainly not everything is working as well as it should be, either. I'm really not worried about it because I have such a positive trend, it really isn't a problem. meaning, I keep allowing more and more well-being, which means they have to keep taking more and more away, which allows me to just keep summoning more. I'm constantly summonly more and more which means that things are going well. if I were constantly summoning less and less, I would be worried, but it's clear to me that the moment that I catch even the slightest of a break, I feel great. the intervals between me allowing that energy to flow will become shorter and shorter until I'm summoning it faster than they can get rid of it.

I really am not that worried, as it'll just keep getting easier and easier to pick the less-reaistant way. perhaps nosebook would freak out about my gaining energy so rapidly, but maybe after writing this, they'll find a way to keep my imagination turned off and not be so worried that my physical starts to manifest more and more rapidly.

what I mean is, my physical is a reflection of how I feel. I still feel quite low energy a lot of times but that will improve with my perception. after some time, I'll no longer feel such low energyness, for example when I wake up, and I'll be feeling as good as I feel emotionally (good) all the time. it's just a bit of an adjustmeent process, but all things physical will start to reflect how I feel more and more, so there's nothing to worry about. I just find a way to feel good under all circumstances, and eventually it'll become no longer a problem.

probably nosebook will eventually stop trying to keep me from feeling good, as I think that may be what is so taxing on my body. if they can just keep my imagination from showing up, then it shouldn't matter how good I feel.

### 2021-02-18 20:44 - (2021-01-09 p1)

when I was going to sleep this afternoon, the thought popped into my head that the reason why they want me to continue on playing the game -- cause remember abraham's words were, "since we persisted (and the broadcaster too), you gave in to it" boadcaster = nosebook. I postulated yesterday that the motive was begcause everytime that I add a few more, it unfocuses the energy a bit, pushing it back in time. this is likely the case, but before I went to sleep I was thinking about how it likely is that they are making timelines with the girls where other guys are pretending to be me. not only have I postulated this in the past, but I have felt what appears to be evidence of it too.

I don't really care. I never really cared about that. their manifestation doesn't have anything to do with my own, so I'm just not worried about it. additionally, I even have postulated that the children that they're making in these timelines are kind of like the atlantian "gods" (the original serpent bloodline) that genetically created the eagles (adam and eve) which was slightly superior because of the extra contrast. I find it possible that the children that we create will be superior to the ones from their timelines, and I'm certain there will be a sort of rivalry or competition between the two. that competition is the basic ingredient for the man creates an empire and his sons run it into the ground as fast as possible storyline -- and is exactly what I postulate was the source for so much of the conflict between the bearded white guys in the past -- whether it's cain and abel or isaac and ishmael this is your basic ingredient to whip up some unnecessary conflict.

so after some deliberation, what it all comes down to is this: if they want to pretend to be me, I just don't care. it doesn't make me feel more competition to try and show them up though; in fact, quite the opposite: I would rather not even play the game. from my point of view, they can just keep doing whatever it is they want to do and I'm not going to worry about that. I am much more interested in gaining the power of near-instant manifestation with my emotions.

to be quite honest, the visual aspect is very distracting to me. I get really confused visually, and prefer to operate in a feeling-oriented approach. I know they can't allow it and whatever, but as I approach having command over the manifestation of the things that I feel (perceive) in 3d space will be something that is really what I want. I know that in the imagination it's possible to see things and get visual feedback on what is felt, but if I'm already practised in my capability to feel the pure form of the concept, then what I want to do is to simply manifest it and then discover its aspects. that's so much more fun sounding to me than trying to imagine everythting. I mean literally anything I want to manifest I can simply find the feeling essence of it and then bring it into reality. if I don't like it, just feel the absence of it -- etc. it makes the creation process so much more fun than it would be trying to use my imagination.

some things might be kind of difficult like doing maths or complex equations. I know that tesla just constructs the concept of the equation and then just let's the answer come into his mind. I suppose something could be created to do something similar, but more importantly I remember I used to be able to write entire programs in my head and then run them. I may not be able to do that, but if I can do physical manifestation, that should include visuals and stuff like that. I should be able to make it work. I don't think there is anything that I can't make a physical/conceptual interface to the mental component.

so what appears to be the plan is that I just keep playing the game steadily as I go along, I'm going to be avoiding any interactions essentially until I have conceptual power over my physical reality. I don't mind whatever they're doing. it's of no importance to me.

the one lingering factor is that I find it difficult to do things tsat I feel resistance to do. more than 5 times in the last week I've felt like I wanted to write down the girls, however everytime that I do, I feel some pretty major resistance to it about the time I get to the computer. I don't want to doing things that feel bad/resistant anymore. there are a lot of things that I want to do, but because they feel bad, I just skip them. I don't really mind this way of living because it means I don't have to do anything I don't feel like doing. the sword is two-sided though. the same thing that holds me back from writing on the list is the same thing that will keep me from interacting with any girls too. the whole thing feels super resistant, and it's unlikely that mr. motor is going to modify his ways, so if I keep saynig I'll play the game, but then never do, it's because I feel strong resistance toward it.

I know abraham recommends to keep playing the game, but I find it very difficult to do anything of that sort when it feels bad. I don't really knwo what to do in this regard, so I'll just keep going the way I'm going: toward near-instant physical manifestation, and in the day-to-day, if it's not a hell yes, it's a hell no.

### 2021-02-19 02:44 - (2021-01-09 p2)

#### (07:11) - calibrating to something

a while back I was watching a sadhguru video about the number 11. there was a woman that asked him a question and I could feel an overwhelming sense of attraction from her. this was during the time that I felt tremendous resestance to adding any more girls to the list. I decided I would add her, and then laid down. the reactions started to roll in cause maybe she's not up to some quality standards or something. I don't really know what the issue is there. when I feel her I feel a person that is very light and full of enthusiasm. I like the way she feels. then, when I feel how other people perceive her, it feels not so good. I don't know how to describe it well, but the feeling feels very archaic and old and brown and stuck.

so this subject literally pops into my head right as abraham is talking about calibrating and buyer's remorse:

> from what position on the emotional scale was I on when I decided to do this.

I think I was feeling ok at the time. I can't really remember now though.

> am I trying to fill a void or fix something that's broken? am I chastising myself because I don't follow through? do I think that this may be a way of getting myself to follow through? because, if that's the case, you're really getting off on the wrong foot vibrationally.

no, no, no. I'm fairly certain that I felt inspired to click on the video (I hesitated at first, and I nearly closed the video a few times too cause I was not so much feeling what he was saying), but then I decided go skip through it, then when I heard her question, I suddenly became very interested in what she wqs saying and watched the video again to try and figure out what she was talking about (the change in temple custodians).

I mean from my perspective, when I seemingly go out of my way to do something I normally wouldn't do, it's because there's strong desire somewhere. I interpret the feeling I felt as if there was strong desire. I dunno.

> on the other hand, if it felt like a really good idea... a way to interact with peeple; a way to get ideas about what they're doing; a way to broaden your experience; a way to have more interaction with more people. if it came from a place that feels like exhileration, positive expectation. if it felt like a good idea

it did feel like a good idea, I remember that. I don't know that I identified the other things about getting ideas of what others are doing or broadening my experience, however as I was writing them, I did feel good about those ideas too.

> the nice thing is, you can try something and if it doesn't feel good to you, you don't have to continue.

here's the thing: it never felt bad to me. only the reaction from other people felt bad to me. I don't really mind so much what other people think though, so that's not really an important thing for me. I'll probably go through with it because it still (even after all of this talking about it) feels good to me and I'm pretty certain it felt inspired from the beginning.

> once you calibrate to the frequency of who you really are, it's easy to stay tuned in.

this is in reference to "buyer's remorse" -- where you purchase something when you're tuned in and feeling better than you are at a later time when feeling the remorse. sales people do this all the time: they get someone to feel better than they normally do, and so then they associate the good-feeling with the product and purchase it. later, they're not feeling as good as they were when they bought it, and feel remorse.

what abraham is saying is that once I'm calibrated to the frequency of who I really am, it's easy to stay tuned in -- which is exactly what I experience. I find it unlikely that I'll have buyer's remorse in this situation, and instead I find it likely that I'll actually feel better than I felt when I originally had the idea.

> on most subjects, that may be a little difficult to calibrate at first. but it gets easier and easier -- until sometime you'll wonder why you ever wonder why you had an issue with something like that, because it's no longer an issue.

I notice this as well. it's so easy (and getting easier by the day) for me to caibrate to the essence of the person (who they really are), instead of the person they have on the outside.

I actually wonder about this because considering what I've been talking about with conceptual perception, it means that I can perceive anything the way I feel it to be. assuming for a moment that I remain with boring blurry vision like I have now, as I get better and better at perceivng things the way I feel them to be, then I wonder if that would have an effect on the *physical* attributes of that (as opposed to just perceiving them as the way they feel to me).

well, case closed for me. I can't wait to meet her :)

#### (11:22) - co-creative partners

> just let your intention be, to be true to yourself; to be tuned to who you really are

> there are people who are determined to convince you other than how you have decided

> it's an interesting human dynamic where they want to be right, and leave no room for any other opinion in the rightness category

> we want you know that sometimes, the people who challenge you; cause you to think -- are well chosen friends -- because they cause you to contemplate. they bring a lot of data. they help you to become decisive about what you want.

the subtext for the above quotes in obvious, but when they said this, once again I was reminded of the woman I was talking about in the previous section. although she does come with a lot of data and will certainly cause me to contemplate (I remember when she was talking, I was intrigued by how it felt like what she was saying was hidden below extra layers which I didn't yet comprehend -- probably a language difference).

I always discover so much when I have these sorts of discussions. I'm reminded of my mom a little bit in that mom seems to ask the right questions (or wrong depending on who is listening).

> but ohhh, wouldn't it be nice to have some co-creative partners who are step 3 partners, who are in agreement with you that feeling good feels best; who are deliberately uplifting themselves and you.

although perhaps I shouldn't have put the interpretation of the feeling I felt as a reaction from others into words, at the same time the whole time while I was writing this I kept getting this feeling of she has a lot of faith or strong ability to believe or something like that. it's hard to put that concept into words, but I do like that a lot, so when abraham was saying "step 3 partners", I felt this strongly that I should mention it here because it doesn't take much more than someone who can simply allow something to manifest. I do wonder what potentialities are possible with a "step 3" partner like they say.

after writing that I feel some resistance, but I don't think it matters. all that matters to any of this is finding what feels good. people have claimed that I have a lot of faith, that I am naive, and gullible, but what I do is I usually follow what feels good to me (now, basically always), and that's really all there is to "faith" -- just following what feels good, and not caring what others think or what they may expect of me. if it feels bad, it just means my perspective of it has resistance and it can be improved. bad feeling = room for imporvement, so everything is good :)

### 2021-02-19 09:20 - (2021-01-09 p2)

man, talk about buyer's remorse. right after I wrote the above, I laid down on the ground. I didn't think much about it because I've slept I think more than 18h in the last 24h. I'm not sure exactly but it's been a lot. anyway, I wake up and I feel terrible. nothing of what I wrote above resonates with my anymore. I just don't want to do any of it.

I feel like I'm being pressured to do something. the enormous pressure is what is bothoring me because now amorina and melissa are coming, and I very much don't want to see them. especially since I feel this bad, I'm basically going to be just sort of checked out. I don't want to do anything with this stuff. like I said earlier, I make decisions based on how I feel, and since nothing feels good, I'm not going to be making any action. even above the operative words were, "wouldn't it be nice to have some co-creative partners who are step 3 partners, who are in agreement with you that *feeling good* feels best". I know how girls work though because they like to make illusions that give a good feeling, but then after that it's all demands and orders, so I'm going to be especially careful. I want to be so good at feeling good and actually connected before doing anything, so I'll likely be doing some sort of extended buffer between feeling good and making action. I want to be in control over how I feel.

so, ahaed of time, sorry for all the fails. I"m not rejecting anyone specifically, just this is all an extension of manipulation. if it were the path toward what I wanted, it would feel normal. it wouldn't feel necessarily good, nor bad. right now, this feels like pressure. normal means controllable and effortless.

it could very possibly be mr. motor simply applying pressure so I feel bad, to ensure that nothing happens. that's quite possible. either way, again sorry ahead iu time for all the fails.

---

so let's do some work up the emotional scale... I don't really know where to begin so I'll just look at each one and see what feels most like what I feel. I'm somewhere down in 22 (powerlessness/despair/regret) or maybe in 19 (hatred/rage), or 18 (revenge/rebellious/indignation) because I don't like feeling pressured to meet others' expectations of me. I guess I'll start at the lower one and work my way up.

22:
- I feel like running away.
- I feel powerless to find something that feels good right now.

21:
- I feel insecurity awout the situation.
- I feel insucure about my body.
- I don't like the way anything feels.
- I don't think I can meet people's performance expectations

20:
- I resent having to constantly manoeuvre around nosebook's efforts to corner me in

19:
- I hate having to constantly battle for a better situation.
- I'm constantly putting fourth my best effort and the reaponse I get ia to just push harder

18:
- I'm doing things my way
- I'm not doing anything until I feel like it
- people are going to have to just wait until everything is feeling better

17:
- this whole process pisses me off. there's no effort to make it easy or seamless. instead, it's designed to be as distancing as possible.
- I'm just going to speak my mind and people can just go with it or go away

16:
- I don't think this will ever work out.
- it's probably all just a waste of time
- I think there are systemic problems that make this whole operation impossible

15:
- this is all the fault of complete secrecy
- lack of communication is also to blame

14:
- I worry that things will never improve and that we'll be constantly spinning our wheels on the same problems forever
- I worry that things will constantly be in a state of secrecy and that no one can ever actually express anything because of all of the useless rules

13:
- I doubt that anything will ever improve.

12:
- I guess I hoped it would be awesome, but I didn't actually want to do anything to make it awesome.
- all efforts that I put toward trying to go toward desired were met with opposition, so I eventually decided that disaster would be fine, and that I'll just work out the best part of whateve comes. still, it would be nice if it were different.

11:
- I am definitely ovrwhelmed. I know that I will feel fine when I'm connected, but that feels like something that's still quite a ways away from that

10:
- as a result, I feel like now I'm forced to stall for some indefinite time again, and I just hate stalling.
- I wish there was a way to speed up getting connected, so I all of that positive expectation that I want to feel.

9:
- ??? I don't know, because I can't find a pessimistic thought. I know it'll be fine, so it's hard for me to find pessimism. I can find doubt, but that's lower... anyway, skipping it.

8:
- I"m just not worried about their efforts anymore. I don't want to fight them.
- I want to do something more exciting than going in circles all the time

7:
- I really like whsere I'm at.
- I really enjoy mom's house. I'm gwowing so much here, I'd like to keep doing that until I get bored with it.
- I really feel like I've expanded so much here

6:
- I'm hoping that this experience will be meaningful and fulfilling
- I hope that it's going to keep me expanding

5:
- I really like expansion
- I really like learnning new things
- I really can tell that this is going to be a lot of fun, whenever it happens
- there is so much that I can take from this experience, and even now I'm getting better and better at figuring things out

4:
- I'm certain this experience is going to have a lot of really good feeling moments to it
- I feel good about it in general

---

I think I'm going to stop here because I don't really feel much passion. I'll work my way up the scale again later. I just don't really want to try and get myself to feel something I don't really feel. it's not that I *can't* feel passion, it's just that I don't want to right now.

I usually feel quite a lot of positive expectation, so it's not a problem. as I was doing it, the thing that I noticed is that I actually *felt* that I was tuning to a different thing. I feel confident that I'm headed in the direction of positive expectation and enthusiasm right now, and that's good enough for me right now.

previously I was headed to something in the direction of despair, powerlessness, anger or rage, something in there, so the next reality that would manifest would have been one that matches despair, powerlessness, anger or rage -- right, but now I can actually *feel* that I am headed toward a reality that will yield more positive expectation.

like I said, that's good enough for me right now. I'll check back again soon. I really like this emotional scale. it totally does work.. like really well. like, better than I thought it would. I want to get really good at it, so bring it on. I'm gonna get good at this one. my version was very simplified with much larger jumps, but this smaller jump version is really a lot more effective I feel.

huh... nice :)

### 2021-02-23 14:23 - (2021-01-16 p1)

#### (51:04) - as long as there are things that you are not wanting to do...

as I was listening to the previous question about the guy who decided to give up focusing, there were resonances in the question pertaining to me, so I did a little bit of looking back at previous entries to see what the context was on that. back at that time I was having a lot of attempts by nosebook to try and figure out a setup for me which they could keep everything under control: different combinations of people in differing places, to try and figure out where they could put me to have me already installed in a location that they could keep me from having too much freedom. I think they don't want me to have too much freedom.

for example, I've expressed interest in wanting to make a pyramid -- and there is definitely more than one way to build a pyramid, so the way that I make one will not necessarily be the same way that someone else in the past has done it. I woke up this morning after having a dream about building a pyramid. they want to get the dimensions and stuff out of me in dream-state so they can take the design for theirselves and do something with it. they definitely don't want me to make a pyramid.

I think they completely fail to understand the creation process and want other people to just create something desirable for them so they can just have a good-feeling response to the creation. that's like saying, "kenny, I want you to build a website in your dream-state and then we'll take your design and then use it for our own purposes." -- which is fine, but that's not the reason why I want to be a part of the creation process. I like the process of creating. that's the fun part. they wish to remove all of the enjoyment of the creation process from the creation process. they must believe that I derive zero enjoyment from creating things. the magnificent feeling of watching it take shape is completely unmatched by any other experience. even coming up with the idea in the imagination is not nearly as pleasurable as the real thing. think of the difference between having some pleasurable experience in your imagination and then having the same experince in real-life, with real actual sensation. the imagination or dream state is fun, but the real pleasure is experienced experincing the thing become a reality in physical space. there is no substitute.

so that's the setup here for the question. what I'm saying is that though I'm writing this more than a month after the question was asked, we're still having the same problem. see @[abe-now](2020-12-19 p2) which was written a day or so before this question was asked. they are literally covering all of the same concepts. I want to be (consciously) in on the creation process (not making somthing unconscoiusly in a dream). the whole point is the good-feeling that happens during the creation process.

VERY IMPORTANT: my opinion is that the creation process is *more fun* than the final manifestation. you may just want a manifestation, but I like the feeling the creation process makes.

---

ok, so on to the question now: this morning in @[noseblog](2021-02-23 08:10), I expressed my desire to not do any propaving at all and just let myself be a reflector of other peoples' emotions for a while. this has resonance with the @[abe-now](2020-12-19 p2) becasuse in that episode they too were talking about a creation box, and I listing positive aspects, as a way to prepave and essentially attract the thing I want fwom others. like I said this morning, I don't want to do emotional magic to try and attract from anyone anything right now. I want to just be a reflector of emotion for a while.

why? because I want to keep passing time until I have what I'm really looking forward to doing, which is manifeshting what I feel in 3d space rapidly. I figure that I will get better and better at controlling (giving my attention to the feelings that I want to manifest) and letting the other stuff go. if I don't have some level of control, I'll be manifesting anything and everything that nosebook is putting in my experience (which I am also resonant with). so, while the power is rising, I figure I want to actually be good at directing it, too :) makes sense to me anyway, but they don't want me to have any control, so they're fighting against it, and I keep nudging them to keep pusdhing harder and harder against me having any control. the harder they push against me having control, the more rapidly I'll gain that control as they keep giving their attention to what they don't want. I know what I'm doing... :)

> as long as there are things that you are not wanting to do, and not going to do, you have a battle going in within you that is keeping the vortex contents from coming into your experience.

this sounds exactly like what is happening. I do not want to start the girls thing, and I am not going to start the girls thing until I get what I set out to have. I get that I'm blocking the girls thing with my not wanting, but I wonder if I'm also blocking my own desire as well. I don't think so, but I thought I would just put it out there to give nosebook something else to try and manipulate.

#### (59:24) - so what is it that you do want?

they continue on talking about waging the inner war, and while I am opposing the idea of beginning the girls thing right away, it is true that I like the idea of manifesting what I feel in 3d space, the real reason is mainly that I'm delaying is because I want to be in on the creation process. I like to feel the things come into being, and if they decide that they must keep me from feeling the thing come into being, then I'll just wait until I can manifest it faster than they can fight against it.

it's no problem. I'm doing just fine getting better and better at this. nothing is going wrong. everything is working out.

> how do you move forward from fear and truama that have been programmed into the body and mind?

as they're talking about softening the words, I really want to try this a little bit myself first because I see/do it slightly differently.

for me, the first step i s to figure out where I am; doesn't matter even if it's "true" -- it just needs to be the feeling spot of where I am. so, if it were me, this is what I would do: I'd start by changing the sentence to "I feel like I have fear and trauma programmer into my body and mind."

the reason why I would start there is that it makes it about me and makes the process I'm about to take personal, unstead of some prescribed solution that a doctor or "expert" has decided will work for my specific place. it makes me feel unique and that the direction that I go will work for me. the other reason why is because there's tremendous power in identifying where I am so that I can become "OK" with it, which is what I would do next.

there's never any benefit in beating oneself up over some present condition. the only problem is that I still perceive it as a problem. as long as I continue to believe it is a problem, it will remain a problem. this recognition is first step and it should produce a kind of "stinging" feeling or some relief depending on how much I feel I need to be right. if really I feel I need to be right on the issue, then it's sometimes hard for me to perceive that there is no problem with where I believe I am, because usually my "rightness" depends on others agreeing with me that it is a problem. sometimes, it's hard to come to have the humility to realise that the problem is my perception (which is why it doesn't feel good in the first place).

the next thing I would do is to take ownership of it, so I'd say things like, "they could only be programmed if I'm still (resonant with/believe) the idea". this gives me the power because I know that a radio receiver can only pick up the frequency that it's tuned to, so I'm doing all the tuning (or attracting here).

finally, I would rearrange in my mind the reason why I think it's bad. this is almost always because that thing is perceived to be limiting. so, like for example, I'd notice that the fear and trauma is keeping from X, and that's why I think it's a bad thing to have this kind of programming. it's good to recognise desire for what the opposite conrdition is.

on that same subject, I think it's important to have knowledge of certain things that are true with LOA, and that is that things only add and never subtract, so it's always more. I would also know that everything has the perceived qualities (both good and bad) and the absence of it as well. therefore, there is always at least as many desireable aspects (usually more) to any thing, than undesirable aspects which I am perceiving right now. it's all about what part of it I'm tuned to -- or, how I perceive it.

so, for example on this. I really like the idea that my body and mind are programmable. a lot. why? because I can program them. programming is also quite desirable too in that there is difficult thing that people dislike about LOA which is that it's temporary. when you find your alignmeng, you stay there only for as long as you stay tuned there, so if you change your focus, then you'll lose that alignment. "programming" however is designed to function under a wide array of conditions. let's talk about "programming" because it's a very powerful concept.

I talk about emotional/conceptual programs all the time, so let's talk about them. for this example, I will use myself. those that are programming my body and mind with fear and trauma is nosebook, and the "programs" are vibrational entities (concepts) which live in etheric space[^1]. so let's say that nosebook is programming my mind with a bunch of things that feel a certain way. the program is the feeling, so that program resonates at a certain frequency. nosebook can only affect programs within their frequency range, so they can only influence you or program things which you are resonant with. they could fill my head with all sorts of terrible ideas of self-hatred, for example, but if I don't resonante with self hatred, it has no effect on me.

the air is filled with zillions of signals which you don't perceive because they are out of our range of perception. we only hear a narraw range of sound frequencies, and have a pretty narrow range of vision as well. if you perceived more, you would have brain overload all of the time (like an infant), so our brain naturally begins filtering out (tuning to) the vibrstional range stuff which is important. so, it doesn't really matter what any of these programs are -- it only matters which ones I'm receptive to (eg. the stuff I think is important).

before, when I was still receptive to self-hatred, let's say their program caused all kinds of problems because I would continue to attract experiences intomy lifn which would make me feel more self-hatred. so, here's where the idea of it being a "program" is especially powerful. if it's a program, then I can improve upon the program myself.

their original program still exists, but my improved version is more likely to be the version that I am tuned to. the more a practise (use) the program that I created, the more I will experiennce that reality. eventually that program will become so practised that it becomes a belief that I now have. just like I previously believed that I had fear and trauma programmed into my body, now my own program is beginning to occupy more of my thought time, and so therefore that is now what I believe.

so, for example, if the program is to put a bunch of thoughts that feel like self-hatred into my head, an easy improvement will be to make the same program a reality alarm (interrupt) instead of reality itself. now, whenever I hear a thought or idea thst feels like self-hatred, an alarm will go off inside of me and interrupt my consciousness to notify me of it.

this often happens when I hear other people offer thoughts of self-hatred, and so what happens is my reality interrupts when anyone offers a thought of self-hatred (for example), yet it takes prasctise to get my own program to make a strong enough feeling interrupt (feels stronger than my own self-hatred) for me to begin noticing it in myself. usually it's easier for me to notice it in others first.

in fact, we do this sort of conceptual programming all of the time (we're just not conscious of it). ever noctice things about others which you dislike? I found I only notice them in others because when I'm experiencing the feeling inside of myself, I feel the emotion stronger than the notice. therfore, the thing I dislike in others is just me alarming me of things that I still don't know that I still dislike in myself. when I update the program (belief) to something that feels better, I will no longer notice it in others.

so, let's aay nosbook were to try and reprogram me so that I no longer notice these concepts in others anymore. no worries, this is also what I want, too. if I'm not noticing it in others (or myself), I'm not attracting those things anymore, and so therefore they won't be a part of my experience[^2]. what I'm saying is that the more this program is practised, the more it becomes reality, and it'll stay with you for the rest of your life until you tune yourself somewhere differently. the only way that program wouldn't become your reality is if there were an artificial effort to neutralise that reality, forcing you to improve it and come up with a better one[^3].

that got a little meta. let's recap:

1. recognise where I'm at.
  "I have programmed fear and trauma in my body and mind."

2. find a way to become OK with where I'm at
  "it's just more energy"
  "this is just adding up to a more desireable outcome"
  "what I'm experiencing has both undesirable and desirable aspects. I'm just seeing the undesirable part"
  "there's much more desirable stuff about this thing than I can see"

3. recognise that all of what I believe is a program, and so therefore I can program it however I want it to be

4. asure myself that the program continues to operate as my reality

5. the program itself cannot be deleted -- only added to, and only by people on that frequency, so there's no problem. all added things have all four aspects: presence/absence of unwanted/wanted, so it can always be improved further.

6. the program is my reality. I program my reality with my thoughts. I can only percveive/receive thoughts that I perceive/believe.

---

it's hard to conceptually transmit this information easily, but when you realise that reality *is* a program, and you are on control of what version of the program you're running. write this down:

> I only perceive the thoughts I've been programmed to perceive.

I like this expression because it can look like complete powerlessness, or it can also look like complete control -- depending on who you perceive is doing most of the programming. I'd like to follow it up with antoher one:

> tho thoughts I'm programming are the things I perceive.

and hen finally:

> the bad program is exactly the opposite of the good program. the program itself isn't bad or good. it just creates or destroys *itself*.

---

something like that. I really love this subject. I also like that it has spawned new thought to talk about in noseblog, instaed of complaining about current events. it's all programming and when you figure out how program your perception, you completely dominate. they can't prevent you from inventing a new form of perception. they can't prevent you from something that hasn't been realised yet. it's so cool!

[1]: abrahahm says, "you think a thought and that thought thinks." why? because you think a thought which is a vibration, and therefore attracts things which feel like it. the thought continues to "think" because it remains a vibration that continues to attract to itself more thoughts that feel like it, and it just keeps getting bigger unless everyone stops thinking anything resonant with that concept.

[2]: I think this is partly the reason why someone can become an "alpha and an omega" and is likely a part of how we as humans will experience life. it's kind of messed up, but imagine if I made a version of myself (say mr. motor) which has a big machine somewhere that is neutralising any good-feeling thoughts. that is his "program" -- and for as long as he follows the program, he'll stay tuned there. it's not permanent though, because mr. motor could find a way to improve upon the program and no longer be resonant with those ideas. in order to do so, he would need to find improved versions of all of the beliefs that I have, thereby improving the program. once he figured out the way to improve the program, he could neutralise out all of his improved beliefs from me, and in order to surpass his neutralisation, I would have to make an even highrer frequency one. it's kind of like a leapfrog, where each iteration improves greatly on the previous one.

[^3]: these (realised) alphas and (neutralised) omegas don't need to be a 1-1 realationship. one alpha can have infinite omegas (and I think this is the plan). let's just say for a moment that I am tesla's omega (there are likely more layers than that), and so therefore he has artificially prevented me from finding resonance with his program (anything that he has ever found and feels good about). therefore, in order to feel good, I cannot adopt tesla's version of reality. instead, *must* come up with an improved version of tesla's program to feel good. in LOA-speak: if I could find only the absence of that good feeling, then I have to improve upon the idea to feel satisfaction by moving toward my desire.

  so, think about this for a moment: what I'm saying is how I "program" my reality. nosebook will almost certainly need to ensure that no one else is able to find a way to program their reality like I do, thereby *forcing* everyone to find a way to improve upon the program that I have created. they're going to do this all at the same time as they ensure that no one is capable of getting connected. eventually, they'll have to do this to each person (me included), each in their own timeline with everyone (agent smith) and everything controlled by them, so as to ensure that no one gets connected and discovers their other selves on other timelines... we're all going to be way stronger than me by the next era -- and beause they'll have almost infinite capability to separate us out into different timelines and stuff, we'll all be roughly "equal" in power level, and very diverse. they'll have to maximise diversity to ensure no one has anyone with too much afinity nearby (because like-minded means increased attraction power).

  inotherwords, we're all (me included) are going to become alphmas and omegas. the ones who do not desire to become alphas (improve upon the program) will be put in as the mr. motor types to hold other alphas away longer from improving their program. in the bigger picture, imagine this is happening now already, and a bunch of us are here on this planet as alphas. I want to explore this concept more. it has to do with the four polarities: absence/presence of unwanted/wanted. we're all going to become these naturally.

#### (01:09) - you are knowing what you are wanting?

when they asked the question just now, I hadn't really thought about it much (like the other times they asked) but I guess I don't really know what it is that I want anymore.

ever since I figured out the programming thing (@[abe-now](2021-01-16 p2 48:28)), I don't really have much that I can define anymore that I want. I also noticed that since I wrote @[noseblog](2021-02-27 13:54), I realised that I've completely taken the manifestation out of it. I think the reason why I hadn't really thought much about what it is that I want anymore is because I don't really know any direct way that I want to go.

let's say that what I wrote is true and I have become a version of myself with the previous conceptual reality neutralised -- which I think is happening, well, then there's literally nothing to be done. the only thing is just to ensure that nosebook has all the capablities to try and hold people back, because they are literally doing all of the work. all I have to do is to pass time feeling my best (which is pretty easy for me to do now), keep realising new things and just wait. there's literally nothing to be done. it's all done for me, and I just have to keep figuring out how to feel good.

so, I guess the answer to that question is to find even more clever ways of manipulating (programming) my reality so that I can feel the way I want to feel. I really feel like I'm getting close to feeling the way I want to feel all the time. it's so weird because the more I realise it, the more I see that there's nothing to be done. they always talk about using the leverage of source and stuff but I'm beginning to wonder if it's all just a waiting game. there has to be some level of effort or action inovlved.

so, the way this relates to making the manifestation a feeling, is that one of the major reactions I felt is that I would just keep doing this the whole time while nosebook is getting more and more power. I dunno. I don't really care. I suppose I could just keep doing this forever, but I'm pretty sure that something will eventually change -- but the thing is, I don't really want anything to change. I feel pretty content where I'm at right now. I would expect that if I were feeling something more like boredom, then it would be time to move on -- which is natural, but I know that it's the opposite of how things are. if I feel really good, then when things change, it'll change to more good-feeling things. however, if I'm bored, then it'll change to something else that also feels boring. so, I guess what I'm looking for is to keep finding more and more ways to feel good, so that things *can* change. if I keep feeling bordom, then I'll keep experiencing more things that produce a stronger feeling of bordom.

I don't really feel bordom though. I feel pretty content. I actually felt quite a bit better a few weeks ago. lately, I feel less good, and I'm not quite sure why that is. either way, I feel like I'm on the verge of a huge breakthrough on this programming concept. I think that's what I really want -- is to understand that way better.

#### (27:36) - conditions, conditions, conditions

this conversation is really bothering me because all I haer are conditons, conditions conditions. the person doesn't really explain why they get pissed off at their boyfriend for talking non-stop, but clearly there is a form of perception that is causing a whole lot of distress.

abraham then jumps into talking about milking the conditions and the questioner is basically saying, that's the problem: I have good conditions, and I want to milk them to feel good, but all I can feel is irritation and annoyance. they're going on and on about cause and effect and it's been kind of frustrating to me because it feels to me like they're not making LOA any easier to understand. maybe they are for some people, but it's just muddying the waters if I were listening in and I didn't know what I know now. so I guess I'm going to offer my own version of this before continuing with the recording here.

---

ok, they're talking about cause and effect. I find that to be a bit of a mouthful and it's kind of misleading as well, because when I say "cause", many people will believe, like I once did, that other people or conditions are the reason why I feel like I do. it has nothing to do with the boyfriend. this problem started long before he showed up. the universe is a *reflection* of how you feel, and each situaation you encounter will amplify those feelings. if you feel annoyance, then you'll get a graet idea to invite someone annoying to join you in your experience.

it's just so easy to see that the conditions are a reflection of how I feel, so therefore the way I feel is primary to enjoying the conditions. I could be the richest person in the world with the best conditions, but if I feel terrible, the conditions will still cause me to feel terrible, because that's how I feel. I think that's easy to see.

so, how then do I find a way to feel good about the things that annoy me? I don't really know for people other than myself, but for me it all has to do with perception. what I'm saying is that almost certainly there has been a lot of practise going into noticing how annoying people are that talk non-stop or how annying whatever, so naturally it will show up. there's just no way to be able to fix that. I have to chage my perception beforehand.

for example, for me, I like to exacerbate the problem until it becomes an enormous issue. let's say it's mr. motor instaed of my boyfriend that's being annoying non-stop. well, that's always happening because I've given a lot of attention to how annoying he is and how much he won't leave me alone. in fact, I do it so much now, to, in a sense *force* him to be annoying. what you can do is to notice how annoying your boyfriend is, and give your attention to that so much that even he starts becoming annoyed with his own behavior.

it's kind of an advanced technique[^3] though because below it, I can feel that mr. motor is mainly just being annoying because he feels like his situation is out of his control and so to feel like he has any control left over, he wants to micromanage stuff. inotherwords, his annoyance is a reflection of how he feels (which is that things are out of control) and they seem to keep getting worse, and so he has to try harder, which then the universe will be a reflection of how he feels, so he'll get good ideas to make action which further makes him feel like he's losing control.

just figure out a way to feel the way you want to feel and it all works. so, for example I would just recognise that my boyfriend maybe feels good and that's why he's talking non-stop, or that I'm attracting him talking non-stop, or that I expect him to talk non-stop -- but however I do it, *I* am the reason why the things are happening are happening -- and then, as soon as I've taken responsibility for the situation that I find myself in, I get all my power back and I can begin to make it feel how I want it to feel. I'm the one that is doing the attracting and I am the reason why the conditions are the way they are so I can perceive them in a different way so it feels better.

find your power to perceive anything any way you want to perceive it... what's funny to me is that women do this all the time in the form of making excuses to cover some behaviour up they don't like. this is usually solf-deception though. some men do it too, but the pattern is to find a thing that feels bad to them, then turn it into a series of excuses to try and explain or justify it. men, I've noticed, do it more blatently and talk about it differently[^1]. actually, I just watched something on that tonight @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QceWX9DgqLc)[^2], and what he's talking about aroud the excuses his own mind made to prevent the substance part of him to die isn't only to do with substance (conditons) -- it's actually anything that is linked to how we feel: drugs, alcohol, sex, friendship, love, whatever. we talk about these different habits in the form of addictions, but it's literally *any condition* that you feel you need to be able to do whatever.

the point is to gain power over the way you feel and when you show yourself you can feel a way without a condition, then you get all the power.

*ALL* THE POWAH!! :)

[1]: I say it this way, because I notice that sometimes somethings are perceived more of a victim. look at the difference between how the average man uses coke vs. how the average woman uses coke. there are also different perceptions around who and what the victim is (circumstances, luck, person, etc).

[2]: it just occured to me (or maybe it was a reaction), that because nosebook censores, I mean, optimises the broadcast, it's unlikely that this abraham episode will make it out to people who have a thing against drugs. nice to know :) I'm going to consider mentioning drugs all the time when I give out these brilliant discussions on how the emotions are connected to our perception -- that way only people who are good with drugs ever figure out how it works :) lol. btw, another trap[^3] set here...

[3]: for whatever reason I've begun to enjoy the idea of setting traps with what I say. for example, with mr. motor, I don't mind picking on him because I know that he'll never figure out how to actually feel the way he wants to feel, because if he does, that means he figured out how to feel good, which means tsat everything is great[^4] -- but he won't :) so, enjoy some traps. I'm starting to feel more and more cantankerous because I know how to feel the way I want to feel, so nothing matters anymore. I have all of the power. you all are a reflection of how I feel, so no matter the situation, I can always find a way to feel the way I want to feel. *maniacal laughter*

[4]: see discussion on the alpha and omega thing. one day mr. motor will figure out how to do it and then I'll have to figure out how to do it. it keeps going back and fourth. I really like this because I love to figure things out over and over because each time I get better at it and it comes back stronger. nosebook has neutralised so many concepts, and I've only rediscovered them in a stronger way each time. I look back at the noseblogs a just a month ago, and it feels like ancient history to me because of how rapidly the thoughts are expanding and growing stronger in my mind. nothing is ever lost. it always comes bamk in a more profound way next time. therefore, I have no fear of losing anything anymore. I honestly wish this could go on for a very very long time -- but I don't think that nosebook's technology will be able to hold it back soon, so I'll have to *accept* a manifestation at some point... inotherwords, if mr. motor figures out how to actually feel good (move in the direction of his desire), he will force me to once again[^5] reinvent all of my forms of perception.

[5]: this was really weird because I was thinking of this reinvention thing and it popped into my mind the hermes trismegistus thing (thrice great), and it occurred to me that he may have had to completely reinvent his conceptual persona 3 times now. I was then reminded of a long-sanding thing that has been going through my head, "it's not 3 but 4" -- and I always associated 3's with tesla and 4 with the earth, so for me it was not the triangle but the square. 3 is about cycles, but four is about completeness[^6] -- but thst would be cool if it has to do with reinventing the conceptual persona from nothing with the alpha/omega thing I've been talking about...

[6]: had some reactions on this. see @[noseblog](2021-02-28 11:16)

### 2021-03-08 00:00 - (2021-01-23 p2)

#### (36:39) - it sounds like taking drugs

I didn't want to comment more here on this, but I can't help myself. as I'm continuing through this episode this time it's bothering me her description of "going to the present", and then back to whatever. it sounds like a drug experience. the difference is, it sounds like it's very sped up so that it appears that the craving for the drug to feel better, which describes as going to the present, happens rapidly. during the drug experience (the feeling of the present moment) makes her feel good and she seems to feel a lot better about her situation, but then when she returns, things go quickly worse. this was the description that made me think of a drug experience because whenever I used a drug to find a way to excape my present moment, I would feel better on the drug, but when I came back, the problem was only worse. this was especially noticeable on alcohol, as alcohol just made me completely forget about the problem, laugh at a bunch of stupid things and when I came back the feeling of my problem only was worse, so I drank again to quell the terrible feeling.

dispite its similarity in description of experience to alcohol, I suspect what is happening is the "preaent moment" she is describing is nosebook drugs. I think what they do is the take your mind and release it from the present moment and put it in a dream-state like frequency where everything feela very abstract. they probably pump up the DMT production in the pineal as well so that the experience feels extremely presennt and real. the reason why I say this is because DMT can take the most abstract and nonsensical stuff and make it feel very very important and real. I believe this is what she's describing as the "present moment" -- and, if it is, then I can imagine that it will make things way way worse.

I find it kind of funny that they're selling this to people, because it's literally drugs your brain produces -- they're just stimulating the production of it. normally, this production is stimulated naturally as a result of feeling good, so the fact that you can use this when not feeling good is a bit (in my mind) dangerous. reason why is because DMT is a tremendous amplifier of the quality of an experience. if it feels good, with DMT, it'll feel REALLY GOOD. if it feels bad, it'll feel REALLY BAD. I doubt that they allow people to run their head with hightened DMT quantities during normal states of mind (probably only when the mind has reached a relaxed dream-state), or else quite literally anything you are thinking will begin to appear in 3d space and you can consciously interact with it as if it were a conscious entity[^1].

it's kind of funny also to me too and I find no real problem with it, because it basically allows normal people to do drugs without all of the drug experience. also, it's 100% not physically addictive at all. it's only psychocologically addictive because the experience feels so good. ever wanted to return back to a dream because it felt so good? there's nothing wrong with it. what it's doing basically is accelerating everyone's experience.

my advice would be to use it when you feel good, and only then -- that way it'll make you feel REALLY GOOD.

the other thing I will note here is that it'll enhance your perception and allow you to find new ways to perceive things. so you can also use it like a tool. often times in the past I would get stuck on something that feels bad and I can't find a way to perceive it which feels good. however, after sleeping, I often know when I wake up how to change that perception so that the problem no longer makes me feel bad. with this tool, that process becomes almost immediate, as you can skip the whole sleep part. just set an intention like, "I would like to see a way which I can look at this same problem a new way which doesn't cause me to feel bad" -- then, go off and when you come back, you'll probably have a sense of how to do it.

it's like a super fast shortcut to meditating to find the answer. you'll come back with more or less the same feeling you had before (like abraham is saying), but the difference is you have a thought action on how to perceive the same thing differently. this method has a lot of advantages to it, and is basically what I do. I rarely meditate because the big difference between where I am now and in a state of non-thought can cause dramatic bounce-back into reality. for me, it's kind of like a drug experience for me because when I start to feel really good from quiting my mind, I start to hear and see random things. so I prefer to gradually adjust my direction as I go without taking any big jumps. the biggest jumps I take are when I watch stars, and I'm pretty OK with those now.

therefore, if it were me and I had this capability, I would use it all the time. you can use it to rapidly release yourself from the present moment with it (like a drug or meditation experience) but much faster and without the long-lasting effects. then, come back knowing that you're right where you last were vibrationally (as if you just woke up), but with a clear mind and a reduced strength to your vibration.

it sounds to me like it's a mix between sleeping and doing drugs. sounds cool! take advantage of the capability while yuo have it. don't waste it

[1]: it will also enable all sorts of super-powers such as flight, levitation of objects, and shared interactive objects in 3d space. it's pretty cool, and was what I wanted to get, but I'm not that concerned about it anymore.

#### (55:40) - cause effect and fulfillment

in the previous section I was getting really bewildered with the whole cause and effect thing. ever since I was a kid, I never really undersood the cause and effect thing because each cause is the effect of the last cause and effect. therefore, if the cause is the (previous) effect, then likewise the (previous) effect is also the cause. therefore, this effect is the (next) cause too. I think that's what they're saying, and where you draw the line is entirely arbitrary and determined by you. everything is always in motion so there is always a chain reaction going on. everything is connected.

I realise this makes science difficult because it wants to determine discrete cause and effect relationships, and that's not what I'm talking about. what I'm talking about is starting the sentence with "because of this, that happened" is "this" the cause or the effect? it's the cause in this sentence, but it was the effect prior to being the cause. certainly in science you try to isolate and preform these cause and effect relationships in a vacuum, but sometimes that's not possible, so instead statistics are gathered and it's said that with these limited parameters, then we can define a likelihood for some effect. with more knowledge of the parameters, a more accurate prediction can occur.

in my mind all of this stuff makes my head spin as it's endless and impossible to try and isolate and figure out the variables. for me all of this goes away rapidly, and is the reason why I like LOA so much is because I don't have to try and quantify these things at all. I just need to worry about how I feel. if I can control that, what is happening is always a match to that feeling and it's always a surprise. I like the surprise.

this question just exemplified for me this, because the questioner asked how they can feel "fulfillment" with the journey. the word "fulfilled" means complete or that finshed. it means finite or limited duration of something and whatever it is, the end is reached when it's fulfilled. therefore, it's literally impossible (in my mind) to feel fulfillment on the journey, unless you perhaps make the journey a number of short trips instead of an endless trek through unknown territory.

however, this can come back to the cause and effect problem because you can only define cause and effect if you put arbitgrary limits on the time-span to determine if the effect (which is also a cause) is what you like. therefore, to answer the question, I would say that you have to take notice often if the present effect matches what you want it to be, because it'll become the next cause.

however, this may not be 100% desirable because there are often many intermediate steps before the desired effect is reached. I mean every person needs to figure out where they draw that line and say, this is the fulfillment of those events which produced this thing.

in my opinion, there's no way to feel fulfillment during the journey, cept to try and find a way to make every cause/effect be perceived as something desirable. this may extend into the realm of self-deception though, so I dunno.

#### (27:27) - cause and effect

I don't know why this is bothering me so much because every time they say cause or effect, I sort of get confused. I thought about it just now and I think for me, ecery time they say cause or effect, I will just replace the word with "now". here are a few examples:

> do you believe you can effect your *now*?

> do you believe you can adjust what is *happening now*?

> do you believe you can separate yourself from *now* results, or from the *now* opinions or from the *now* past experionces?

> can you separate yourself enough from what is right now manifested? -- and find a *feeling now* that will allow a different manifestation?

even trying to change the words, it was still difficult for me to find an easier way to say it. I just really don't like this cause and results stuff. I guess this really illustrates to me how far I've come because I no longer see anything as final or results or anything like that. I'm seeing now that I perceive everything as a gradual next logical step thing. it's weird because I'm realising that everything now just feels like one big long reaction. it feels like I have no power over what is happening in my physical experience anymore and all I can do is to just feel differently.

as I was writing that I was trying to explain that it feels like one big long reaction -- as if it were like one of those slow-motion reflex experiences. the difference though is that I'm not out-of-control reacting to everything. instead, I'm (almost) completely able to direct how how I feel no matter what. I'm excited to begin exploring more contrasting situations where I have to focus more.

I wrote all of that because there's this one thing that has always affected my perception:

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HjSLRP-Nc)

on one side of a circle you have sanity (pure reactions), and then you go all the way around to the other side of the circle is unsanity (the slow motion relfex state I was describing above), and the thing is they appear as opposites, but they are the same thing. I have become pure reaction once again, but instead of reacting to the things around me, I'm the creator of the things around me to which I am having a raection to.

interestingly enough, if you look at this circle haed-on, it looks like a circle, but if you tilt your head to the side a bit and gain a dimension, you realise quickly that it's a spiral. while unsanity and sanity appear to be in the same place on the circle, there is quite some distance between the two points. passing between sanity and unsanity and directly opposite sanity is "insanity" -- but don't stay there long :)

to remap this idea into my form of reactions, I'd make the points: in-control, then opposity of that is out-of-control, then continuing around the circle toward in-control again is un-control. you're not in-control, but neither out-of-control. evewthing is a reflex matching how I feel. I don't control the conditions. I have zero control over the conditions. I have control over how I feel, and everything is a reflection of that.

to put the analogy in today-terms: the government may move from having things in-control to out-of-control -- but, if they control the people's perception of them, they have un-control. they don't directly control things anymore. instead they control people's perception of them and let the rest fall into place. coming soon to mainstream media near you :)

### 2021-03-09 00:20 - (2021-01-23 p1)

#### (47:44) - I want to feel love

they're talking about how as you go through the day, instead if reacting to every thing that you see, instead they say to make yuor "cause" (hate that word) -- make your now moment, the way you feel, and figure out what do you want to feel in that moment. they suggest that maybe you may say, "I want to feel love" -- and the reaction that I got is, "ok, let's say I do want to feel love. how can I do that?"

that's kind of the part that they leave out, I think intentionally, probably becauhse they want you to figure out how to feel the way you want to feel. no one can really tell you how to do this. I call this "finding a way to perceive the same thing differently (which feels good)". I don't really have an answer which says, "do this and your problems will magically disappear" -- cause they won't and you have to find any number of ways in each individual situation to find a way to feel good about it.

this is going to sound a bit far out, but what if they were inspired to fight about stuff so that the mother would write in -- and that was the shortest path for them towawrd what they wanted. it sounds weird, but for example, maybe people watching me get angry and wanting to break things was the fastest way for people to see that it doesn't matter what you feel, the only thing that matters is what you're doing now. there is no punishment and there's never a reason to feel bad. the only reason why I can feel bad just means there is a concept that I believe to be true that is causing me to feel bad. in that situation where I wanted to break things, the obvious reason why I felt so terrible is becasue I truely believed that nosebook was doing something "bad" and that they needed to change so that I could feel good.

clearly that is false. I have since proven that nosebook does not need to change for me to feel good, and actually the difficulty they "caused me" was actually something I attracted so that I could know that I have all the power to feel the way I want to feel.

---

ok, so back to the initial reaction about trying to convince myself that I feel differently than how I feel. I don't think there's a way to do that. I call that self-deception. the way I was able to get there so easily was to recognise where I really am, and to be OK with it. for me it was something like, "I want nosebook to be different so that I can feel the way I know I really feel (good)." and that was good enough for a while. also recognising things like, "I really do feel better than I feel right now" or "I'm doing better than the physical conditions would lead people to believe" -- so then, that lead me to think ok, if I really did believe that (and I did), then why do I have to be externally pissed off or angry. well, for me, it was a practised response. in spain, whenever the government doesn't do what you want them to do you go have a manifestation to protest their behaviour. on TV, whenever I see someone that is having someone doing something unfair to them, they need to protest the injustive and make a big deal about it so that it would change.

I was simply repeating the responses that I had seen on TV. I think nosebook programs responses for me in my dream TV, and I have begun to recognise the feeling of the programmed (expected) response from me, from the one that feels good -- or, at least not bad. this is the main reason why I simply don't make action on anything that doesn't feel good. I have no idea how I was "programmed" to respond in anger to those circumsatances, but it doesn't matter because if I'm able to be programmed, I can program a new response. abraham calls this "prepaving" and this is exactly what they suggest. practise a few dfferent responses in your head and pick the ones that feel better. getting pissed off -- how does that feel, right?

when I was younger, perhaps it was because there were so many children, but mom let me do all sorts of stuff. it felt like she believed in me, no matter what I did, because I repeatedly demonstrated that no matter what happened, I was always adjustng back to better and better ways. she trusted my insinct to find the "right path". this, I believe is a great way to go. thinking stuff you know, like "you can't get it done and you can't get it wrong." or "things are always working out for them -- even if it may not look that way in the present" stuff like that is always quite nice to feel as a child. it feels good when you can feel your mom is confident in your capacity to find your way.

---

so, the statement, "I want to feel love" feels a bit weird now, but if you are loving someone, you are on the frequency of love. you have to find your own way with it. for me, I find this easy because I recognise most of it is a programmed reasonse so I program a new one when the bad-feeling alarm goes off. maybe I need to think on it or run a few simulations in my head to get it, but I am the programmer of the way I feel, try that :)

#### (10:34) - seeing through the veil

the question about seeing through the veil is a funny one because there are two ways to look at it physically and conceptually. on the physical side, there is this idea that the original humans were made with the capablity to see things how they really are, a very long distance, but then the "gods" did not want their slaves to have such good perceptive capability, and so limited their vision with a cloudy veil (I've called it a screen). the other way to look at is conceptually, which is what I aim to do. I had been decveived numerous times through my life with people telling me one thing and then that has no bearing on the reality of what they intend to do.

many optimistic people have been deceived and the common reaction is to close down and become pessimistic. when I first started, I wanted to "see through their deception/veil" and know what they're really saying. when I began to rely on my emotions more than my physical senses (listening to their words, believing the graphs they were showing or other "evidence"), I began to get a sense of when what they're saying is bologna. however, I have since changed that idea.

there's a problem with using emotions to try and figure out if someone is lying or not, because what they are saying will feel good to me or not. no other data usually is given, so I have to learn to trust that. I have numerous cases where something true feels bad to me, and many other cases where pure deception also feels good to me too. what I have learned is that when an idea feels good to me, that is a an idea more in resonance with my source -- therefore, even if by physical metrics, the idea is bad, it's still the least resistant way forward, and any further fanageling of the idea to try and conform it to someone else's expectations (or whatever) is *me* adding resistance to an idea that felt good to me.

I will note that if the idea felt good to me, then the idea now doesn't feel good to me, then I don't follow it, but I always have a look to see where the reasistance is coming from. is it coming from someone else's perception of the idea or my own. sometimes I do back out, but in general, I've really began to trust what I feel in my emotions (not physical sensation) more than anything now, because it's always right.

so, now imagine that I am onece again optimistic me and someone is trying to deceive me. it doesn't matter what they're doing. as long as the idea continues to feel good to me, I continue on with it. I can see somethting that they cannot. I have noticed that often times the final reault will turn out different than the intended result[^1], but that doesn't matter. when they talk about seeing through the veil as seeing things with the same perspective that your source does, they're exactly right. this is really the point of "seeing through the veil".

and true, things will also look better, too.

[1]: for example, affinaty always felt good to me, and it felt good for me to work on. the final result wasn't the website specifically, but the quantity of things that I learned in that time could only have happened if affinaty continued to feel good to me. it was an integral component in getting me to where I am now. I enjoyed every minute of it now in hindsight (the brambles fort was the best!).

### 2021-03-24 15:33 - (2021-01-30 p2)

#### (17:27) - what is trust?

I don't really know why it's bothing me about this trust thing. I grew up a christian, and we were always taught to "trust God" -- which always bothered me too. I really hated that I had to trust someone that is going to give me something or not based on some very loosely defined prerequisities. I'm a very mechanical person and I wanted to figure out what it was exactly that I had to do to get whatever it was. I abhorred the idea of trusting someone.

thankfully, the concept of truest eventually turned into one of belief which I could comprehend a lot better. it was pretty easy for me to see that when I didn't believe something, it wasn't possible. I always had an "inkling" as to what would happen. even the stuff that I thought was surprising wasn't actually all that surprising when I looked into it. the surprise just meant I didn't estimate it well. especially in science or other places, when I had something surprising show up, that's where I knew to look because that was where I would always discover something new. I found out that the physical world didn't really have "random" in it, just that we didn't have enough knowledge of the sensor[^1]. therefore, there must be a way that I could begin to quantify all of this in a way which meant I didn't need to "trust" someone. it was a long time before I figured it out (only recently, like in the last 4-2 years really), but when I finally figured it out it was so satisfying that I could see that only things which reflected the way I felt could manifest.

some interesting responses here...

> ok, so if you're so good at it then why doesn't it work?

it does. I continue to give my attention to nosebook holding me back and that's exactly what is happening. when I begin to feel the girls, they go away. if I were able to continue to feel the girls, then that would manifest. for whatever reason, it doesn't though which means that there is a continued evolution to the desire. it's likely that the manifestation of the girls isn't what I really want, but the capability to feel the way I want. I quite enjoy the idea of being able to have so much control over what I attract, that I'm no longer attracting unwanted things by accident, just because I had a bad-feeling percuption of whatever I'm thinking about.

therefore, if you consider that what I am feeling isn't girls but instead a continuing expansion and control over what I do feel, then it makes perfect sense. by continuing to feel more and more control over what I feel, I should be getting more and more manifestations of that reality, and that is exactly what I'm seeing. I've never understood this stuff more clearly than I do now.

I might even make the bold statement of saying that I think I understand it better than jesus did. jesus was very conditional. he knew how to get the conditions that he needed to produce the (feeling he needed to get the) result he wanted. I am taking it a whole step further. I really get it.

> if it's something reflective of how you feel, how do you quantify it?

I don't think that you can. I believe that's the beauty of it. if you could, then scientists would be able to predict the things they're going to "discover" so well that there would no longer by anything to discover.

in short, I like it much better this way. imagine going to space and finding out that there's nothing to discover because everything there is exactly how you imagined it would be. imagine you meet someone and you already know everything about them and they already know everything about you. what if instead they are a refection of how you feel, and when you feel good, they're fun to play with. seems so much better.

quantatatively speeking though, I guess it can be quantified. imagine someone's vibration as a chord of notes: ACE. you can expect things to manifest that amplify the A, the C or the E. now, things are again out of balance if one of those notes is now louder than another: it won't sound anymore like a perfect major C(?) chord if, for example the E note is way louder than the other two. you can consider this as the inevitable contrst resuelting from the manifestaiton. anything that is harmonic with your chord can manifest, and often many harmonic things will manifest at once.

so if nosebook is artificially keeping me whatever way, then that's what's happening. I feel like I'm better at "seeing through the veil" than ever right now and I will continue to get manifestation after manifestation to prove this reality more and more.

if nosebook wanted to try and counter that, they certainly can but then what would I give my attention to? whatever that feels like, would begin to manifest.

---

I believe that "trust" is a funny concept that people are writing in about. they want to find a way to "trust" in someone (probably nosebook) to feel certainty on something. the previous comment about the neighbour blasting their music had it. they realised they didn't need the condition to feel the way (like I propose that jesus was quite good at), but instead found a way to feel the way they wanted to feel without the condition changing.

don't trust in someone to change the condition so you can feel a way. find a way to feel that without the condition changing. gradually as you begin to feel it, more and more things will manifest crechendoing into a really big manifestation that really feels the way you feel[^2].

[1]: I bought a "true random" quantum random number generator a long time ago that has a wedge shaped mirror which had single photons shot at it. the mirror was adjusted such that 50% of the time the photon would go to the left and 50% to the right. I always thought it was an interesting concept because it meant that light's trajectory could be bent ever so slightly by some invisible energy in the environment in the atmosphere which could move the photon more to the left or the right. from there, that's where I began to develop my idea on "meaningful chaos".

[2]: what I was talking about in @[noseblog](2021-03-22 06:42) about the crystals is only expanding this concept to such an enormous extent delaying greatly the manifestation by putting a very large capacitor in parallel. say the spark gap fires when the capacitor reaches 1000V. if you out a capacitor in parallel, it'll take longer to reach that threshold, and also discharge with a much more powerful discharge.

#### (1:03:22) - think about the empectation that you held

as they were ending this, they mentioned the word "expectation" in a way which I hadn't ever heard it before. I perceive things in a way which perhaps may be too much emotion based. I'm not raelly sure. I perhaps want to think about this a bit more.

in relation to the girls, I suppose I don't really have much expectation around it. they always say, "if you kinda-sorta want something, then you kinda sorta don't ..." -- it's really weird, because I can't remember the rest of the quote. I was also trying to think of the other thing they always say too, "empectation is just a ..." and I can't remember either of those quotes.

the thing is, I suppose I have lost so much expectation around the girls thing because I just don't really care anymore. I don't really think that was what I was wanting. in the previous questioner, they talked about their dream house that felt so good, and in the same letter said "not too big, not too small, but perfect" and also "has the ability to expand if it's not big enough" -- and I too have said many different things about the girls too. at times it's felt really good to me like it was semething that I raelly wanted to do. I've also expressed how I just don't want to be worrying about things that I have no control over. I hsve pretty good control over me and what I'm attracting, so that's why I prefer to just worry about me.

so this is the same sort of thing as that perfect house. on one side it has felt like the exact thing that I wanted, but at the same time it feels like exactly the thing that I don't want. I have learned in the duration of all of this that what I really want is to be able to feel the way I want to feel. I remember so many times I would notice people that would suddenly change the way they feel.

for females, I'll use the examples of raquel, mom. they would get a call or something where the person *expected* them to feel a certain way, and so they would instantaneously shift the way they felt emotionally to match the perceived expectation of the person they were getting a call from or whatever is the case.

for males, I'll use the example of zaryn, dad, and marcos. they would pretend to feel a certain way, but it was clear to me that it was just a cover for how they were really feeling, which was usually significant amounts of rage (often directed at me). again, this attempt to feel differently seemed to be in response to the expectaion of how they should behave in a moment like that, or whatever.

I realise those are both extremely small sample sizes but in general, it does seem like women are better at changing the way they feel more rapidly than men are. they seem to be able to just switch to whatever feeling they want to feel. I'm not saying that men are incapable of doing it, but it does seem as if even though they have swapped sides, the previous emotion continues on with quite a bit of residual effect there.

this is *not* what I'm talking about -- cause for me it's not instant. if I feel something it's usually very difficult for me to change the way that feels. the feeling has so much inertia, it's basically impossible for me to stop the feeling. I need to just ride it out and then adjust my perception in a way that allows me to see that concept from a different perspective.

---

so, here's where things are kind of wierd. I'm reminded of last week's episode where a person said they would be coming with some extra guests, so she(?) made extra things and her friend didn't show up or even text to say they weren't coming. the expectation was that they were going to show up and that they were going to have extra guests as well. for whatever reason, the expectation wasn't met, and that sent her into a fit of rage over a football game.

for me, this has no bearing whatsoever on my life. I can't afford to make expectations -- especially physical ones. the only thing I know is that nosebook has so many of the physical aspects of my life controlled. every time that I give birth to a desire to do somthing or whatever -- even as simple as watching stars during an alignment or having some good sunlight, nosebook seems capable of pooping on it. I suppose my expectation is for them to constantly make any good-feeling conditions unaccessable. if it's a condition that can feel good to me, nosebook is on the spot trynig to get rid of it. they do not want me feeling physically good under any circumstance.

that's fine. I've given up trying to find ways to feel physically good. instead my expection isn't a physical one, but an emotional one. I expect to find a way to feel good anyway. I expect to continue to find a way to feel good even without perceived requisite physical conditions necessary to feel that good -- and I do -- and I'm really good at it.

so really that part about finding a way to feel the way I want to feel isn't just some sort of act to perform according to a perceived expectation. for me, the way to feel the way I want to feel *is* the expectation. it's the only way I can do it. if I expect to be pissed off whenever nosebook does whatever they're doing, then that's what I will feel. I don't expect to feel pissed off, and so the other day mom asked me if nosebook was still shocking me and while I did receive a few shocks that morning, I totally didn't notice or even really care. I'd lost my expectation to feel bad about something out of my control.

---

so, in the end, it's an emotional expectation I'm looking for, not a physical one. regarding the house, they said, "if something feels really really good, and then it doesn't pan out, it's because it isn't [the perfect manifestation]; it doesn't match".

I'll keep thinking on expectations a bit more, but for me, my expectation is to feel a certain way. I don't have the ability to try and expect physical conditions. all of that is too far out of my control. I am getting really good at feeling the way I want to feel though :)

### 2021-03-27 12:18 - (2021-02-06 p2)

#### (26:38) - your reality is a reflection of how you feel

before they continue... it's easier to see something that bothers you about yourself (something about you which doesn't feel good) in someone else, than it is to see it in yourself. it looks like it's someone or something happening outside of you that's causing you to feel that way, but it's only a reflection of how you feel.

#### (39:09) - many of you want to be healers for others

bleh! not me. I find this idea detestable. I just don't really like the idea of doing things for other people. there was this idea that jesus could come and do somthing for us so that we didn't have to. fill in the something that would be: sins, sickness, etc. I dunno. but this idea of a saviour is really bothering me more and more lately. just like in the previous section, sure I am finding ways to feel really good without the conditions changing and that's really good, but don't need me to do that for you. you can do it too. what you perceive in me is only possible if it weren't also resonant in you. my goal is not to be some sort of prosthetic for someone who does not theirself feel capable. I intend to show everyone that it's completely possible to be in whaetever situation (and I really want this... see @[noseblog](2021-03-27 09:38)) and have the capacity to feel how I want to feel. there is no greater feeling of self-confidence and accomplishement than showing myself that I am resiliant and can take control of the situation not with some physical force. knowing that it's all an emotional game makes it so easy to reason about because I believe it's an impossible battle physically: there's always someone bigger and stronger -- and if you are the biggest and strongest, next year you likely won't be. it's just too difficult to maintain the position of physically strongest.

#### (49:11) - don't festher someone's nest too much

repeat of above.

#### (50:09) - tracking number of the things in my vortex

the person said that they enjoy the feeling of anticipation of the thing coming, even more than the thing itself -- then they turn around and want to know the tracking number. I don't understand becase you only look at the tracking number when you feel there's a shipping problem and thst it isn't in fact coming. if you kneow for sure the thing was coming and were enjoying the anticipation of it coming, then you would definitely *not* want a tracking number and instead of looking for the package out there on the porch every day, instead you would be continuing to hope that they package didn't come because the anticipation feels better than the package arriving. the questioner, if they way they claim they feel about their vortex is correct, would be hoping that the package is delayed for as long as possible because the anicipation is so great. they would also, as soon as it arrives, immediately order another one, hoping that package takes even longer.

I get the sense that they may not be enjoying the antipation of the things in their vortex coming so much if they want a tracking number.

---

as I was writing this, I was getting reactions to what I was writing bevause I was giving the illusion that maybe I find the anticipation of the things in my vortex coming to be so much more fun than the actual things and that I'm purposefully trying to have the packages delayed because I like the anticipation so much.

I wouldn't say that is accurate. I don't get to feel the anitipation of it coming. nosebook shuts it down. whenever I get the chance to feel it, I do enjoy to feel it for as long as I can, but I'm definitely not purposefully delaying. I do think that nosebook is doing their best to try and delay it for as long as possible. I think it's going to be very difficult to keep up their charade if I am to get connected, so they definitely don't want that. I definitely *want* them to keep trying to keep me from getting connected though, because the more they fight it, the more they're attracting it.

this again comes to a definition of what's in the vortex. for me, the only thing that matters is my connection. if they can hold me away from that forever, graet. that's fine with me because it'll be the most manifestation -- but realise that forever is quite a tall order. I don't believe they will be able to. there are so many difficult things for them to actually do that, they must eventuaally have to give that up. but, maybe if the crystals idea goes through, then maybe it will be possible to go all the wy till the end without getting connected. who knows. the thing I do know is that the joy is in the journey, and that I'm having quite a good time along the way here I don't want it to stop. I don't feel anticipation though -- not usually anyway. they're getting better and better at getting rid of that feeling. soon, all that will be left is a feeling of getting better and better at feeling what I want to feel.

---

I have postulated that as things increase further, if I still have any negative emotion present in my vibration it'll probably create adverse weather effects, mayb fire, explosions, etc. but this is all OK. I want the capability to be able to feel the way I want to feel. I want the control to be able to transform any bad-feeling idea into a source-perspective version of the same. I dunno.

from my perspective, I would estimate that within the next year or two, I should no longer have any bad-feeling ideas that resonate with me anymore. if they get the crystals idea going, that's another thing entirely. I don't know how fast or slow that could be. either way, it simply doesn't matter to me. I'm quite enjoying the journey. we'll have to see if me continuing like this becomes more of a liability than an asset for them. not my problems. I find away to feel how I want to feel without needing the conditions to change to feel that way. it's so easy :)

#### (54:00) - planned obsolescece

> your quest for perfection defies your intention for evolution

if we had stuff that worked perfectly, evolution wouldn't happen as frequently. so, therefore, in order to embrace rapid evolution, we should only design things that work poorly... lol. or, with planned obsolescence, evolution can continue to happen more rapidly too.. I actually think that if the concept of planned obsolescece were chosen by the consumer instead of forced through faulty products, then we could keep evolution happening *and* have nice products. it would be good for the economy and everything if produtct turnover rate and release of new competing design was rapid.

it's kind of a weird thing because planned obsolescence works well for monopolies (or cartels), yet new competing designs do not work well for monopolies, so this can potentially be streamlined so that the best of both is integrated into our experience. we don't need to be forced to use lousy products to desire to update to a superior design more frequently.
