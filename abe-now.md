### 2020-09-18 18:?? - (2020-09-05 p1)

I noticed a few different resonances in their emotional scale. I used to go all the way down to depression and dispair when I had something come up, however I noticed that instead of going all the way down, the last few months or so I noticed I may only go down to discouragement or dissappointment.

lately though, I noticed that I only go down to pessimism though, then right back up. I like pessimism because it's a lot like doubt. typically I noticed that I when I do go down, I typically only go down to the range:

9. Pessimism
10. Frustration/Irritation/Impatience
11. Overwhelment
12. Disappointment
13. Doubt

so, when I, for example get down below that, in the range of anger (17), dicouragement (15), or blame (15), it's easy for me gto get back to doubt (13), which is then really easy for me to skip all the way up to pessimism (9).

it seems to me obvious that there are a few other resonances between some of the emotional states, which allow for quick jumps too, for example between discouragement (16) and disappointment (12) ... (incomplete, becsuse I need to think on it some more)

### (41:30) - jumping back into the problem

I do this all of the time. after a while of getting used to this, sometimes it's a lot of fun to go and jump back into the prolblem to kind of stir up some more trouble again... why? because once I've established a new perception of the "issue", then I no longer need to worry about the issue having powkr over me anymore. once I go back into the problem, I'm not even perceiving it as a problem anymore, so it's easy for me to separate in my mind, the difference between the problem and the new way in which I perceive it, giving me almost like the ability of an actor, to be in the problem and giving it an emotional focus, yet at the same time, knowing that it's not a *real* problem -- but, a kind of "pretend" problem.

the point that I'm making here is that while abraham does guide people to go up and down the scale, which is *very* important, because without understanding that, what I'm saying doesn't make a whole lot of sense... what I'm saying is, that if the problem can be perceived as a "manufactured" or "pretend" or illusory problem, then it's easy to make these jumps. not everyone has the capablity of controlling conditions or manufacturing problems because that means you have a lot of control or something...

for example, imagine you are the illuminati or something that is controlling a whole lot of conditions -- and you are able to manufacture problems, then you can easily achieve what I'm talking about where you can jump back into the problem, and knowing that the problem is not a real one, stir up some more problems for the people who still feel like they are powerless to solve the problem. I think this happens on a global scale, and I think it's intentional, too. the goal is to continue to reinforce the belief that one is powerless to affect the situation, when, because the situation is controlled (in the case of almost all global issues), one really *is* powerless to change the situation.

so, it is, in my opinion (for me at least), it is of utmost importance to learn to change my *perception* of that situation, otherwise what happens is I just keep cycling around in that scale, going up and then fallling back down to powerlessness (22), then and up and then falling back down again. when changing my perception, when I do fall, I don't fall nearly as far, and getting back up is a much easier process, too.

when say, change my percteption, I mean to, knowing the laws of the universe, understand that the problem is, in fact, illusory, and it's almost always someone trying to control conditions so that they can feel better (pleasure or power are the usual ones).

#### (45:30) - getting stuck

as a continuation here, the reason why I used the example of the illuminati, is because, if one is so used to needing to have control over all of the conditions in order to feel like or be able to control the conditions in such a way that it feels like the problem is illusory, then they're probably going to have a pretty difficult time coming to the conclusion that *all* problems are illusory. I know that all problems are illusory, because source (and me too now in almost all cases) can look a problem and does not feel any negative emotion over the problem. all actions/thoughts are either moving in the direction of the solution, or making the solution bigger or more inevitable (from source's perspective). it's *only* as long as one continues to perceive the problem as real and tangible, that it continues to be perceived as a real problem (obvious, right?). write that down:

> as long as I perceive my problem as real and tangible, then my problem continues to look like a real problem

### 2020-10-11 20:53 - (2020-10-03 p1)

#### (45:36) - expanding the emotional scale

as abraham is describing these different ways that move down the emotional scale, I'm finding it quite comical because I keep getting these images in my mind where a person (no one in particular) is just barreling through life and they just see one subject after another with each one causing a worse and worse feeling emotion, but they refuse to get to the bottom -- depression or powerlessness, so they instead of getting depressed, they get angry or revengeful and assume that by getting really mad at the problem, it's better than feeling powerlessness -- which is true, but that's as far as they get.

they get real pissed off, then head out to meet up with the next subject which should make them feel depression cause it's the same issue hundreds of time about it, however, instead of feeling depression or powerlessness, they get pissed off and really angry -- more than last time even -- which is a signal that it's time to cool down, so they distract theirselves for a few hours from the issue, which makes them feel better. a few hours later though they head out to find the exact same issue waiting for them again.

each time the issue is getting worse and worse, yet they refuse to feel the powerlessness that they *should* be feeling in that situation and instead willfully adjust theirselves to maybe somewhere in annoyance, or frustration, anger/revenge or something like that -- but never powerlessness. so, by not ever reaching the bottom there, they're expanding the range of emotionans that can be felt in the negative range.

---

I find this process funny to me because the same exact thing is happening to me, hewever in the opposite way: (the analogy doesn't work so well in the literal sense of the emotional scale though) every time that I get close to feeling the top end of the emotional scale, something happens and instead of getting the full manifestation of the really good feeling stuff, I bounce back down to somewhere lower. in fact their entire job is to be able to get me to bounce back down somehow.

you see, this actually indirectly responded to the question that I was asking, which was how in the world am I going to be able to finally overcome their influence on me, because as it seems, in my estimation, I still have quite some ways to go, and being committed to the disaster like I am, it seems like I just keep making it harder for myself...

so, as I was writing out these thoughts just now, I realised that what is happening is when I keep getting to those good feeling emotions: like I said, their job is to find some way to influence me back into a less good feeling emotional state.

---

the funny thing is, they had been talking about how prayer works and stuff earlier, and I kinda wanted to stop and write about it, but I didn't, so I will here. you will notice that they made some points about how prayer is only attraction, so you can't attract for anyone else, but you can influence them. I felt a lot of people's confusion in that section there so I'd like to explain how I understand it to be. I'm going to take it from a negastive point of view though.

imagine you are trying to influence someone with some satanic ritual or something intended to cause confusion. when performing the ritual, you are conjuring into that atmosphere all of that chaos, and because it has to do with tuning, the "location" of this chaos is where the conjurer is tuned to, which is why they often need something that "reminds them" of the person like a lock of hair or a peice of clothing or even some of their bio mass (blood, saliva, etc) to improve the "tuning" to the target's location. they conjure (attract) all of their chaos or whatever by putting a lot of thought energy into it, and so it is created. that's it. now, the person (or people in a situation or whatever) that they're targetting are either receptive to that energy or not.

like the person that was asking about love vs. physical attraction, the conjuruer (the person that they guy was feeling attraction/love which was confusing his thoughts) sets the atmosphere, and so you would think that the conjuruer is always dominant, but not always. in that question, the guy *is* receptive to good feeling thoughts, especially when coming from someone attractive, so that feeling dominated and it was hard for him to get back to the normal worry/concern/whatever thoughts. they had the influence.

this is why it's only attraction: let's say that someone tries to conjure some really bad stuff while focused on me (please go ahead and try it; I enjoy the practise), let's say they're conjuring (attracting) some lust and hatred into the environment while focsued on me. if I'm resonant with lust or hatred, I will feel it and can adjust my perception to find a more productive way of seeing the same thing, effectively making me less and less resonant with that until it no longer even is detectable by me.

in either case, the conjurer is attracting that into their environment, and will continue on having that in their environment for as long as they're receptive to it[^1]. the attraction factor is just mentally (or prayerfully) creating the environment which is more or less in alignment (harmonious) to the desire.

---

whoops, got off another tangent :) so, the answer to my question is easy to see. I shouldn't even need to explain it. if I can get so good at no longer getting bounced back to a less feeling place, then I'll continue to feel better and better and it'll just eventually become impossible for them to bounce me back to a bad feeling place. this is great news. I will say this though, because this also reveals the unwanted part of the same thought:

if they want to make a real good disaster, instead of expending all of their efforts to keep me away from that good feeling place, what they'll want to do is to preserve a few tried and true triggers that are sure to bounce me back into a bad (or less good) feeling place, and whenever they want to make a disaster, they can just pull the trigger. from there, I'll have to find my way back up again, and the better I feel, the bigger the contrast between those two feelings are, and so therefore the bigger the disaster...

---

you know, as a side note, I just want to mention my experience last night. I decided I wanted to watch sirius for the first time this year. it just started rising high enough in the sky in the morning for me to see it, and the sky was clear enough too. it turned out to be quite the experience, and I lost consciousness at the end, and this normally really bothers me, but I've gotten to the point now that it's quite fine that I get really far out with the stars, then I get reset back (eg. lose consciousness) or go backwards on the emotional scale. I remember that right before I lost consciousness, I was really feeling good about my situation and feeling good about the girls and stuff too -- like really appreciating it all, and that's probably why I was doing so well watching the stars. when I came back to consciousness, I didn't feel nearly that good, but I didn't really feel bad either.

it is annoying getting reset back, but I recognised that even though I get reset back, what I'm doing is improving upon my recovery time. I'm able to recover from lost conscoiuness really rapidly now, and that's kinda why I'm ok with this idea of pulling the trgger -- because it's the same idea. I'm headed off into more and more better feeling (and looking) places very very rapidly, when they have to pull the trigger on my consciousness and interject a very chaotic signal (which is why it sounds like loud hissing or static) into it, to remove my consciousness. I just have to get better and better at recovering. same sort of thing. sure it's annoying, but whatever -- it's all about recovery time, and like I started out with: it's expanding the width of that scale.

by expanding, I mean the same thing on both ends: if a feeling pure powerlessness and disempowerment is the very bottom, and you never allow yourself to get there, it essentially means you have to feel worse and worse until you can finally feel that pure disempowerment and so your capacity to feel more and more awful is expanding. likewise, if the feeling of invincibility and self-empowerment is at the top[^2], yet I'm never allowed to really get there, or spend more than a brief moment there (eg. not get much momentum there), again, I'm expanding the capacity of how good I need to feel to be able to finally experience that feeling of pure invincibility (because I attract it all, and I'm good at attracting what I want) and appreciation (cause I like the feeling of what's manifesting).


#### (59:35) - make a decision to focus my mind in the direction of how I want to feel

this is about the make more decisions topic, and I've been becoming more and more deliberate about the things I wsnt to *do*, but I'm reminded of the conversation I had with mom this morning, and I'm just now realising that I want to become more deliberate about the way I want to *feel*. I know I've been saying this for a while now, but it still hasn't quite sunk in yet, and I don't yet navigate purely on the way I want to feel, instead of what I want to do -- yet :) just you watch... positive powerful momentum will happen

> ... and they'll say, "what's going on with you? it seems like everything you point at just happens for you"

[1]: it just now wonders to me if it's possible to conjure stuff, for example that it's a part of their perception... like for example, one of the things that has never had any real pull for me is gambling or betting. what if I were to conjure or focus gambling thoughts while focused on someone, and then just go back to my daily life... would I begin to become a gambler? I suppose.. however I personally think this is such a monumental waste of time -- because *why* would I even want to do that? it wouldn't be cause I wanted to influence another person succeptible to gambling mindset into a gambler. they may get some practise from me on overcoming those thoughts, but it seems to me to be a waste of my time entirely. just go to a casino and order a few drinks if you want to practise getting out of the gambling mindset :)

[2]: I'm using the "power" words here cause it's easier to express my point to people who have not felt this way before, but it's so much more than that. the magnificence of everything coming together and all the great feeling of love and self-appreciation, and appreciation for the universe, source, and everything is such a powerful feeling, it's really indescribable -- so I just use the power words for this point.

### 2020-10-25 16:?? - (2020-10-17 p1)

#### (15:33) - vibration

as they were talking I kept getting reminded of tesla's earthquake machine. what it did, is periodically, it would make a movement, and when those movements matched the resonance of the, in this case the earth below, each time the machine made it's periodic movement, it was at the right time so that it added to the previous movement.

in order to understand this, think of someone on a swing. as they swing, they are making a periodic movement back and forward. if you were to track thier forward and backward motion over time, it would look similar to a sine wave. now imagine yourself pushing the person on the swing. you also push them at the same periodicity that they are swinging but that's because you are standing on the ground.

however, imagine instead of a person pushing them, imagine that there's like a rocket thing under the seat of the swing. the rocket faces in the direction of the person on the swing, and the person on the swing can activate the rocket periodically. if the person just randomly activates the rocket, you can see that half of the time, they are working against theirselves, meaning that if the swing is going forward, and they activate the rocket while moving forward, they move forward more rapidly. however, if they are moving backward, and they activate the rocket (which is facing fortward), they actually slow theirselves down.

you can't really help but to activate your rocket though and you do it every time that you think/feel, observe/feel, or react/feel something[^3]. it happens without you doing anything about it, and the way that it feels is basically your indicator whether you're activating the rocket at the moment the swing is going forward or backward. if the swing is going backward, then your activation of the rocket is actually slowing you down, and that's why you feel bad.

---

it's also worthwhile to ponder the periodicity of the rocket activation as a form of perception. imagine that you are swinging 30 times a minute, and you find that you are able to activate the rocket only when it's going forward. you may turn on the rocket only a few times each minute, but it doesn't matter, because you're only activating it when going forward, so you feel increased momentum.

one can think of the swing as an "opportunity" -- so if you're swinging at 30 times a minute, then you have essentially 30 opportunities per minute to activate the rocket and increase momentum. you can't really go much faster than that. however, your source perceives at a much more rapid rate than that. let's just say your source is running at 120 opportinities a minute[^1].

so, let's say that you've been releasing resistance and you haven't been contradicting that vibration (that is turning on the rocket when going backwards), for a while, then the momentum will increase and you'll begin to feel more power.

I'm going to skip over the power part because I don't understand it very well, but once a certain power level is reached then the person's perception will jump up to the next speed, and their perception will operate at a new speed. let's say that now, the person is running at 40 opportunities per second. each time that the person's perception increases, they essentially have that many more opportunities per second to activate that rocket in the forward (good feeling way) or backward (bad feeling way). that's it. the faster your perception is going, the more opportunities you have to shoot yourself in the foot.

---

ok, going back to the frequencies adding to each other. every thing is resonant with a number of frequencies, however, there are very few things that are perfectly resonant (like the boxes in the serapeum), so everything resonates at a number of frequencies all the time.

every thought that you think makes a feeling, or generates a frequency in the atmosphere, and everything that's harmonic with that frequency will resonate with it a little bit, so you're receiving a ton of information all of the time, and it's all happening at once, however you cannot be conscious of all of it all at once so your brain takes all of these things filters out unimportant stuff and gives you essentially a summary of those frequencies. that summary isn't usually the same frequency as the input frequencies, however it can be. when you're focused, it's pretty similar, but it will always have your "interpretation" or transformation of that frequency on it.

this transformation is your perception. let's say that there is a frequency that is in your envirenment that is vibrating at 15 cycles (you're running at 30), and it happens that all of those 15 cycles are exactly timed so that they occur at exactly the moment when the swing is going backwards and is closest to the ground (when it's moving the fastest). because this environmental frequency in it's untransformed state is exactly timed to go opposite your swing when it's moving the fastest, so this will feel pretty bad.

what you do though is, you find a way to perceive that same environmental frequency a different way, and maybe now it pushes you forward at a different moment, so it doesn't feel so bad. you can continue to improve upon your perception of that frequency until that same energy is now working in your favour instead of against you[^2]. you (and your form of perception) decides when you turn on that rocket.

what I'm saying is that no matter what the environment is, that energy can be used in some way. what I'm saying is that knowing this, one should be able to extrapolate that if that's true, then life should exist in ALL environments of the universe. all that needs to be created is a mechanism for the organism to transform the energy into something useful. it's also really important to understnad this, because once one knows this, it means that there is nothing that is not beneficial; there are only things that are not perceptually transformed into something beneficial. I believe my example speaks to this quite vividly.

---

so what is split energy? split energy can either be visualised two ways. I will provide both examples:

1. imagine that sometimes (let's say half of the time), instead of always firing the rocket when you're going forward, you decide to fire the rocket when going backward. this means that sometimes you go more forward, and sometimes you go more backward, however, there's no real gain in either direction.
2. imagine instead of one rocket, you have two rockets on the swing, one forwards and one backwards, and your thoughts are running in sync, however, sometimes when moving forward, you fire the backward (not good feeling) rocket. sometimes too when moving backwards, you fire the forwards rocket. the rest of the time though, you fire the corresponding forwards or backwards rocket. so, in effect it feels like sometimes going faster and sometimes slowing down, or in a sense, no movement at all.

---

after thinking about it a bit, what I think is happening for vision upgrades is the following: (this is primarily responding to a question/reaction from nosebook as to what I mentioned previously about the increase in power level and the increase in frequency of one's perception)

so let's gather the facts here. I claim that all of my vision upgrades are a result of releasing resistance (that is activating the rocket opposite to the direction) and by altering my form of perception so that things that previously felt bad, are now perceived in a way which no longer feels bad. this modification of perception is really the same thing as "releasing resistance".

nosebook does not believe me when I claim that it's all about releasing resistance, because it seems like I get a lot of vision upgrades when I'm out watching stars. however, we have also seen many other examples where I get vision upgrades in the following scenarios:

1. when there is a strong rain or snow storm and a lot of energy is injected into the environment.
2. during the sunrise, even if I cannot see the sun, often times clearing my mind (meditating), will allow me to get a vision upgrade.
3. during meditation, if I allow my mind to clear and I don't think any thought for a while, sometimes I receive a vision upgrade.
4. sometimes right after I wake up in the morning, when I wake up with a good feeling and I just allow the feeling to gather momentum and don't think in opposition to it.
5. sometimes when thinking about the girls, I can feel quite good about it, and that sometimes can cause me to get a vision upgrade.
6. sex (or maybe even a dream of it), can make me to feel pretty good (pleasure).
7. sometimes when smoking weed or other drug experiences that feel good (pleasure).

in all of these cases, what appears to be happening is that I am in a state where I either allow myself to feel better with some external (pleasure) stimulus can cause me to feel good enough that I receive a vision upgrade.

this appears to validate the suggestion that what is happening is I'm essentially passing over the barrier to the next power level. or, in the previous example of the bathtubs, the water is splashing over to the next layer. in fact, this is exactly what it feels like to me and where I got the idea for the bathtubs, because when I star-watch, clearing my mind of all "important" or "top priority" thought, my mind begins to glide, as it does in meditation and I begin to feel better and better. it's that better feeling that one experiences when in a dream-state.

usually as I approach this height more and more, it often times feels like I'm beginning to lose consciousness, which is why it's so hard for me to actually maintain my consciousness when star-watching. sometimes I'm more conscious of the process than other times, but I know when I've hit it, because instead of a continually upward feeling, suddenly it changes directions and I feel like it's going downward. this feeling is similar to the feeling experienced when mushrooms actually had an effect on me, and most people call this this the "coming up" phase, and it feels like a physical disorientation, because my perception is beginning to vibrate more rapidly.

taking the experience of mushrooms though, you will notice that even if you see at a higher frequency on mushrooms (artificially more DMT is in the brain), when the mushrooms wear off, your vision will return back to the frequency it was previous if no lasting changes have occurred.

essentially, in all of those experiences, I am stimulating the production of more DMT in the brain by feeling good (excess serotonin produces DMT), or by simply not thinking thoughts which make me feel bad. my brain is literally producing more DMT because my perception allows it. sometimes, when nosebook pulls my consciousness, they reset me back to the lowest DMT level, probably by putting a lot of chaos in my head until it's lowered. when I come back to consciousness, I perceive at the rate of DMT which my brain is producing. the brain (or maybe it's the blood, not sure) has a quantity of DMT in it, and the normal person, any injection of DMT lasts for a while until you think thoughts which are contradictory and the brain removes that DMT from the pool.

my case though, nosebook is trying to keep my pool essentially empty, so the amount of DMT (or the frequency of my perception) is limited to the amount of DMT my brain can produce. that production is determined by my perception, or how much my body thinks it needs to produce more to be at the level of perception which matches the way I feel.

when I star-watch or meditate (because they're essentially the same thing, which I will demonstrate this wintertime), what seems to be happening is, that I allow my DMT levels to rise up higher than they previously were, and the water goes to the next bathtub. let's say I started with 100 tubs full, and then I manage to get it up to 110 tubs. when nosebook takes away my consciousnses, essentially discontinuing my ability to continue to increase that momentum (fill up more tubs), the amount of water is essentially lowered down to a lower level, and when I come back to consciousness the tubs refill to the production rate ...

my form of perception is like the rockets on the swings, which is essentially timing. I can't explain it mathematically here very easily, but those rocket timings essentially determine the pressure applied to all of the tubs (standing wave) causing the water to go back and forward. this increased pressure in each tub (cause of the change in timings), causes the water to splash over more easily.

the example here breaks down a bit but just go with it. instead of each tub being equal in length, say that the tubs follow some sort of pattern increasing in width, with the smallest ones being nearest to the left-most tub (the source of the water)...

I'm really struggling to get this example out, but imagine maybe that water = oxygen, and tubs = DMT. the more tubs (DMT) you have the more frequencies you can resonate at, thereby giving you more tubs to work with (this is to illustrate a wide range of frequencies, like a fourier section, even though it's really a  continuous spectrum and there are no literal tubs).

all tubs are filled to some level (the amount of that frequency you're giving your attention to) and they're all sloshing back and fourth at the frequency resonant with the size of the tub. imagine that all of the tubs have some water in them, but they're sloshing around at the frequency of the timing of the rockets associated with your perception, so when I lose consciousness and all the tubs' water (oxygen) level is lowered, but it's impossible to empty them completely. so, when I come back, the tubs which don't have any water in them don't have any sloshing, and the ones that have water in them are affected by the rockets of my perception.

when I have never increased the vibrational speed of my perception artificially, the only way for me to achieve that new speed is by gaining powerful enough sloshing in a harmonic tub, allowing it to slosh over into the next tub. that way is sort of slow, so in order to experience the higher frequency, one needs to stimulate the production somehow. once that production has been stiumlated, and the brain begins to produce more often the water in the frequencies of the previous experience. meaning, that once the brain has had the experience of a frequency, it will begin to produce that same frequency unless it is determined that frequency is unwanted, or not important. therefore in order to expand one's perception, one must stimulate it artificially to a new height.

when reaching that new height, this essentially fills the tubs of those frequency ranges with water, and now your brain, having had that experience, can now copy that, and begin to produce it more easily on its own, unless of course, your rockets of perception are actually inhibiting that production by going the opposite direction (destructive interference).

---

that was super unclear, I realise, but the important thing to notice here is that the brain essentially only copies and reproduces vibration it has previously experienced. if one never experiences a new frequency, the brain cannot reproduce it. in that way, it's kind of funny, because by allowing people to temporarily run their perception at my frequencies, nosebook is allowing people's brains the opportunity to gain some experience at that higher frequency, even if their perception doesn't yet allow it. this experience is very similar to eating mushrooms or smoking DMT, to temporarily allow someone to experience a higher frequency of perception. then having experienced it, it becomes later much easier to alter one's form of perception to allow the brain to begin producing more water in those higher frequency buckets.

what is happening for me is that nosebook is essentially destructively interfeering with the different tubs in my head, and if they wanted to try and create a system that was more effective at holding me back, they would need to find a way to anticipate those tub frequencies (they should be periodic), and to with every vision upgrade I get, automatically begin to destructively interfere with those new frequencies.

actually, this would be beneficial for me because then they wouldn't need to constantly take away my consciousness all of the time, and it would also take away the "runaway vision upgrades" -- where after I get one upgrade, it gets easier and easier to get more and more, up until a point which is basically the limit of my perception, and from there I don't really get more, or the ones I do get, get reset back, because my form of perception is still in contradiction to that higher frequency. essentially, by limiting me this way, I would essentially stop getting any more upgrades that my perception didn't allow. it would slow me down a lot. however, I will probably find a new way :)

I will say this though. if I were continuously limited like that, essentially meditation (or star-watching) would become pretty ineffective for getting vision upgrades and I would need external stimulus, like sex or drugs to experience those higher frequencies -- and even then, they would be pretty ineffective because what I would be doing with these stimulations is stimulating the tubs that already have water in them, and even though those tubs are getting their water drained, they will eventually fill up higher and higher frequency buckets which nosebook does not yet have the technical capability to drain.

from my perspective, it would appear as if I had completely stagnated, yet those higher frequency tubs would be filling slowly little by little because of the way harmonics work (harmonics doesn't fit into the tubs as double-layers analogy), meaning that at some point, given enough time, I would eventually begin to perceive at an extremely high frequency. also, I would imagine that it would be pretty difficult for nosebook to properly anticipate all of the higher frequency buckets with perfect accuracy, preventing them from filling up, so they too, I guess would fill up slowly as well.

another interesting thing about this idea is that because the tubs that nosebook can effectively interfere with, are all destructively interefered with, means that my brain would not gain near as much experience on those frequencies, as my brain would on the extremely high frequencies that nosebook is incapable of interfering with. that means that means that nosebook could pretty effectively remove all of the 4d and 5d perception that they're so vehement in keeping me from, leaving me to only begin experiencing the highest frequencies that they don't (yet) have the capability of interfering with.

by doing this, they could, if they wanted to, essentially stagnate me for a very long time, which means that I would have to find a way to outrun their technological capability.

---

after writing this out, I kind of want to make a simple program to visualise this so people can play with it and get the idea. maybe even like a simple game where critters interact with each other and their environment.

[1]: it's far greater than that. I only wanted to double the number twice for illustration

[2]: as momentum increases, the building momentum will eventually put you over the threshold to the next frequency, and the frequency of your perception will increase. obviously these cycle speeds are much faster, probbly going into millions or billions of cycles per second, so there's a lot more capability for those higher frequencies to harmonise with your new form of perception.

[3]: the important thing to note here is the feeling bit. reactions (from others), thoughts, and observations all can produce feelings inside of the person, and these feelings are the "vibration" that is either harmonising (feeling good) or is discordant (feeling bad) with your source.
