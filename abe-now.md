### 2020-09-18 18:?? - (2020-09-05 p1)

I noticed a few different resonances in their emotional scale. I used to go all the way down to depression and dispair when I had something come up, however I noticed that instead of going all the way down, the last few months or so I noticed I may only go down to discouragement or dissappointment.

lately though, I noticed that I only go down to pessimism though, then right back up. I like pessimism because it's a lot like doubt. typically I noticed that I when I do go down, I typically only go down to the range:

9. Pessimism
10. Frustration/Irritation/Impatience
11. Overwhelment
12. Disappointment
13. Doubt

so, when I, for example get down below that, in the range of anger (17), dicouragement (15), or blame (15), it's easy for me gto get back to doubt (13), which is then really easy for me to skip all the way up to pessimism (9).

it seems to me obvious that there are a few other resonances between some of the emotional states, which allow for quick jumps too, for example between discouragement (16) and disappointment (12) ... (incomplete, becsuse I need to think on it some more)

### (41:30) - jumping back into the problem

I do this all of the time. after a while of getting used to this, sometimes it's a lot of fun to go and jump back into the prolblem to kind of stir up some more trouble again... why? because once I've established a new perception of the "issue", then I no longer need to worry about the issue having powkr over me anymore. once I go back into the problem, I'm not even perceiving it as a problem anymore, so it's easy for me to separate in my mind, the difference between the problem and the new way in which I perceive it, giving me almost like the ability of an actor, to be in the problem and giving it an emotional focus, yet at the same time, knowing that it's not a *real* problem -- but, a kind of "pretend" problem.

the point that I'm making here is that while abraham does guide people to go up and down the scale, which is *very* important, because without understanding that, what I'm saying doesn't make a whole lot of sense... what I'm saying is, that if the problem can be perceived as a "manufactured" or "pretend" or illusory problem, then it's easy to make these jumps. not everyone has the capablity of controlling conditions or manufacturing problems because that means you have a lot of control or something...

for example, imagine you are the illuminati or something that is controlling a whole lot of conditions -- and you are able to manufacture problems, then you can easily achieve what I'm talking about where you can jump back into the problem, and knowing that the problem is not a real one, stir up some more problems for the people who still feel like they are powerless to solve the problem. I think this happens on a global scale, and I think it's intentional, too. the goal is to continue to reinforce the belief that one is powerless to affect the situation, when, because the situation is controlled (in the case of almost all global issues), one really *is* powerless to change the situation.

so, it is, in my opinion (for me at least), it is of utmost importance to learn to change my *perception* of that situation, otherwise what happens is I just keep cycling around in that scale, going up and then fallling back down to powerlessness (22), then and up and then falling back down again. when changing my perception, when I do fall, I don't fall nearly as far, and getting back up is a much easier process, too.

when say, change my percteption, I mean to, knowing the laws of the universe, understand that the problem is, in fact, illusory, and it's almost always someone trying to control conditions so that they can feel better (pleasure or power are the usual ones).

#### (45:30) - getting stuck

as a continuation here, the reason why I used the example of the illuminati, is because, if one is so used to needing to have control over all of the conditions in order to feel like or be able to control the conditions in such a way that it feels like the problem is illusory, then they're probably going to have a pretty difficult time coming to the conclusion that *all* problems are illusory. I know that all problems are illusory, because source (and me too now in almost all cases) can look a problem and does not feel any negative emotion over the problem. all actions/thoughts are either moving in the direction of the solution, or making the solution bigger or more inevitable (from source's perspective). it's *only* as long as one continues to perceive the problem as real and tangible, that it continues to be perceived as a real problem (obvious, right?). write that down:

> as long as I perceive my problem as real and tangible, then my problem continues to look like a real problem

### 2020-10-11 20:53 - (2020-10-03 p1)

#### (45:36) - expanding the emotional scale

as abraham is describing these different ways that move down the emotional scale, I'm finding it quite comical because I keep getting these images in my mind where a person (no one in particular) is just barreling through life and they just see one subject after another with each one causing a worse and worse feeling emotion, but they refuse to get to the bottom -- depression or powerlessness, so they instead of getting depressed, they get angry or revengeful and assume that by getting really mad at the problem, it's better than feeling powerlessness -- which is true, but that's as far as they get.

they get real pissed off, then head out to meet up with the next subject which should make them feel depression cause it's the same issue hundreds of time about it, however, instead of feeling depression or powerlessness, they get pissed off and really angry -- more than last time even -- which is a signal that it's time to cool down, so they distract theirselves for a few hours from the issue, which makes them feel better. a few hours later though they head out to find the exact same issue waiting for them again.

each time the issue is getting worse and worse, yet they refuse to feel the powerlessness that they *should* be feeling in that situation and instead willfully adjust theirselves to maybe somewhere in annoyance, or frustration, anger/revenge or something like that -- but never powerlessness. so, by not ever reaching the bottom there, they're expanding the range of emotionans that can be felt in the negative range.

---

I find this process funny to me because the same exact thing is happening to me, hewever in the opposite way: (the analogy doesn't work so well in the literal sense of the emotional scale though) every time that I get close to feeling the top end of the emotional scale, something happens and instead of getting the full manifestation of the really good feeling stuff, I bounce back down to somewhere lower. in fact their entire job is to be able to get me to bounce back down somehow.

you see, this actually indirectly responded to the question that I was asking, which was how in the world am I going to be able to finally overcome their influence on me, because as it seems, in my estimation, I still have quite some ways to go, and being committed to the disaster like I am, it seems like I just keep making it harder for myself...

so, as I was writing out these thoughts just now, I realised that what is happening is when I keep getting to those good feeling emotions: like I said, their job is to find some way to influence me back into a less good feeling emotional state.

---

the funny thing is, they had been talking about how prayer works and stuff earlier, and I kinda wanted to stop and write about it, but I didn't, so I will here. you will notice that they made some points about how prayer is only attraction, so you can't attract for anyone else, but you can influence them. I felt a lot of people's confusion in that section there so I'd like to explain how I understand it to be. I'm going to take it from a negative point of view though.

imagine you are trying to influence someone with some satanic ritual or something intended to cause confusion. when performing the ritual, you are conjuring into that atmosphere all of that chaos, and because it has to do with tuning, the "location" of this chaos is where the conjurer is tuned to, which is why they often need something that "reminds them" of the person like a lock of hair or a peice of clothing or even some of their bio mass (blood, saliva, etc) to improve the "tuning" to the target's location. they conjure (attract) all of their chaos or whatever by putting a lot of thought energy into it, and so it is created. that's it. now, the person (or people in a situation or whatever) that they're targetting are either receptive to that energy or not.

like the person that was asking about love vs. physical attraction, the conjuruer (the person that they guy was feeling attraction/love which was confusing his thoughts) sets the atmosphere, and so you would think that the conjuruer is always dominant, but not always. in that question, the guy *is* receptive to good feeling thoughts, especially when coming from someone attractive, so that feeling dominated and it was hard for him to get back to the normal worry/concern/whatever thoughts. they had the influence.

this is why it's only attraction: let's say that someone tries to conjure some really bad stuff while focused on me (please go ahead and try it; I enjoy the practise), let's say they're conjuring (attracting) some lust and hatred into the environment while focsued on me. if I'm resonant with lust or hatred, I will feel it and can adjust my perception to find a more productive way of seeing the same thing, effectively making me less and less resonant with that until it no longer even is detectable by me.

in either case, the conjurer is attracting that into their environment, and will continue on having that in their environment for as long as they're receptive to it[^1]. the attraction factor is just mentally (or prayerfully) creating the environment which is more or less in alignment (harmonious) to the desire.

---

whoops, got off another tangent :) so, the answer to my question is easy to see. I shouldn't even need to explain it. if I can get so good at no longer getting bounced back to a less feeling place, then I'll continue to feel better and better and it'll just eventually become impossible for them to bounce me back to a bad feeling place. this is great news. I will say this though, because this also reveals the unwanted part of the same thought:

if they want to make a real good disaster, instead of expending all of their efforts to keep me away from that good feeling place, what they'll want to do is to preserve a few tried and true triggers that are sure to bounce me back into a bad (or less good) feeling place, and whenever they want to make a disaster, they can just pull the trigger. from there, I'll have to find my way back up again, and the better I feel, the bigger the contrast between those two feelings are, and so therefore the bigger the disaster...

---

you know, as a side note, I just want to mention my experience last night. I decided I wanted to watch sirius for the first time this year. it just started rising high enough in the sky in the morning for me to see it, and the sky was clear enough too. it turned out to be quite the experience, and I lost consciousness at the end, and this normally really bothers me, but I've gotten to the point now that it's quite fine that I get really far out with the stars, then I get reset back (eg. lose consciousness) or go backwards on the emotional scale. I remember that right before I lost consciousness, I was really feeling good about my situation and feeling good about the girls and stuff too -- like really appreciating it all, and that's probably why I was doing so well watching the stars. when I came back to consciousness, I didn't feel nearly that good, but I didn't really feel bad either.

it is annoying getting reset back, but I recognised that even though I get reset back, what I'm doing is improving upon my recovery time. I'm able to recover from lost conscoiuness really rapidly now, and that's kinda why I'm ok with this idea of pulling the trgger -- because it's the same idea. I'm headed off into more and more better feeling (and looking) places very very rapidly, when they have to pull the trigger on my consciousness and interject a very chaotic signal (which is why it sounds like loud hissing or static) into it, to remove my consciousness. I just have to get better and better at recovering. same sort of thing. sure it's annoying, but whatever -- it's all about recovery time, and like I started out with: it's expanding the width of that scale.

by expanding, I mean the same thing on both ends: if a feeling pure powerlessness and disempowerment is the very bottom, and you never allow yourself to get there, it essentially means you have to feel worse and worse until you can finally feel that pure disempowerment and so your capacity to feel more and more awful is expanding. likewise, if the feeling of invincibility and self-empowerment is at the top[^2], yet I'm never allowed to really get there, or spend more than a brief moment there (eg. not get much momentum there), again, I'm expanding the capacity of how good I need to feel to be able to finally experience that feeling of pure invincibility (because I attract it all, and I'm good at attracting what I want) and appreciation (cause I like the feeling of what's manifesting).


#### (59:35) - make a decision to focus my mind in the direction of how I want to feel

this is about the make more decisions topic, and I've been becoming more and more deliberate about the things I wsnt to *do*, but I'm reminded of the conversation I had with mom this morning, and I'm just now realising that I want to become more deliberate about the way I want to *feel*. I know I've been saying this for a while now, but it still hasn't quite sunk in yet, and I don't yet navigate purely on the way I want to feel, instead of what I want to do -- yet :) just you watch... positive powerful momentum will happen

> ... and they'll say, "what's going on with you? it seems like everything you point at just happens for you"

[1]: it just now wonders to me if it's possible to conjure stuff, for example that it's a part of their perception... like for example, one of the things that has never had any real pull for me is gambling or betting. what if I were to conjure or focus gambling thoughts while focused on someone, and then just go back to my daily life... would I begin to become a gambler? I suppose.. however I personally think this is such a monumental waste of time -- because *why* would I even want to do that? it wouldn't be cause I wanted to influence another person succeptible to gambling mindset into a gambler. they may get some practise from me on overcoming those thoughts, but it seems to me to be a waste of my time entirely. just go to a casino and order a few drinks if you want to practise getting out of the gambling mindset :)

[2]: I'm using the "power" words here cause it's easier to express my point to people who have not felt this way before, but it's so much more than that. the magnificence of everything coming together and all the great feeling of love and self-appreciation, and appreciation for the universe, source, and everything is such a powerful feeling, it's really indescribable -- so I just use the power words for this point.

### 2020-10-25 16:?? - (2020-10-17 p1)

#### (15:33) - vibration

as they were talking I kept getting reminded of tesla's earthquake machine. what it did, is periodically, it would make a movement, and when those movements matched the resonance of the, in this case the earth below, each time the machine made it's periodic movement, it was at the right time so that it added to the previous movement.

in order to understand this, think of someone on a swing. as they swing, they are making a periodic movement back and forward. if you were to track thier forward and backward motion over time, it would look similar to a sine wave. now imagine yourself pushing the person on the swing. you also push them at the same periodicity that they are swinging but that's because you are standing on the ground.

however, imagine instead of a person pushing them, imagine that there's like a rocket thing under the seat of the swing. the rocket faces in the direction of the person on the swing, and the person on the swing can activate the rocket periodically. if the person just randomly activates the rocket, you can see that half of the time, they are working against theirselves, meaning that if the swing is going forward, and they activate the rocket while moving forward, they move forward more rapidly. however, if they are moving backward, and they activate the rocket (which is facing fortward), they actually slow theirselves down.

you can't really help but to activate your rocket though and you do it every time that you think/feel, observe/feel, or react/feel something[^3]. it happens without you doing anything about it, and the way that it feels is basically your indicator whether you're activating the rocket at the moment the swing is going forward or backward. if the swing is going backward, then your activation of the rocket is actually slowing you down, and that's why you feel bad.

---

it's also worthwhile to ponder the periodicity of the rocket activation as a form of perception. imagine that you are swinging 30 times a minute, and you find that you are able to activate the rocket only when it's going forward. you may turn on the rocket only a few times each minute, but it doesn't matter, because you're only activating it when going forward, so you feel increased momentum.

one can think of the swing as an "opportunity" -- so if you're swinging at 30 times a minute, then you have essentially 30 opportunities per minute to activate the rocket and increase momentum. you can't really go much faster than that. however, your source perceives at a much more rapid rate than that. let's just say your source is running at 120 opportinities a minute[^1].

so, let's say that you've been releasing resistance and you haven't been contradicting that vibration (that is turning on the rocket when going backwards), for a while, then the momentum will increase and you'll begin to feel more power.

I'm going to skip over the power part because I don't understand it very well, but once a certain power level is reached then the person's perception will jump up to the next speed, and their perception will operate at a new speed. let's say that now, the person is running at 40 opportunities per second. each time that the person's perception increases, they essentially have that many more opportunities per second to activate that rocket in the forward (good feeling way) or backward (bad feeling way). that's it. the faster your perception is going, the more opportunities you have to shoot yourself in the foot.

---

ok, going back to the frequencies adding to each other. every thing is resonant with a number of frequencies, however, there are very few things that are perfectly resonant (like the boxes in the serapeum), so everything resonates at a number of frequencies all the time.

every thought that you think makes a feeling, or generates a frequency in the atmosphere, and everything that's harmonic with that frequency will resonate with it a little bit, so you're receiving a ton of information all of the time, and it's all happening at once, however you cannot be conscious of all of it all at once so your brain takes all of these things filters out unimportant stuff and gives you essentially a summary of those frequencies. that summary isn't usually the same frequency as the input frequencies, however it can be. when you're focused, it's pretty similar, but it will always have your "interpretation" or transformation of that frequency on it.

this transformation is your perception. let's say that there is a frequency that is in your envirenment that is vibrating at 15 cycles (you're running at 30), and it happens that all of those 15 cycles are exactly timed so that they occur at exactly the moment when the swing is going backwards and is closest to the ground (when it's moving the fastest). because this environmental frequency in it's untransformed state is exactly timed to go opposite your swing when it's moving the fastest, so this will feel pretty bad.

what you do though is, you find a way to perceive that same environmental frequency a different way, and maybe now it pushes you forward at a different moment, so it doesn't feel so bad. you can continue to improve upon your perception of that frequency until that same energy is now working in your favour instead of against you[^2]. you (and your form of perception) decides when you turn on that rocket.

what I'm saying is that no matter what the environment is, that energy can be used in some way. what I'm saying is that knowing this, one should be able to extrapolate that if that's true, then life should exist in ALL environments of the universe. all that needs to be created is a mechanism for the organism to transform the energy into something useful. it's also really important to understnad this, because once one knows this, it means that there is nothing that is not beneficial; there are only things that are not perceptually transformed into something beneficial. I believe my example speaks to this quite vividly.

---

so what is split energy? split energy can either be visualised two ways. I will provide both examples:

1. imagine that sometimes (let's say half of the time), instead of always firing the rocket when you're going forward, you decide to fire the rocket when going backward. this means that sometimes you go more forward, and sometimes you go more backward, however, there's no real gain in either direction.
2. imagine instead of one rocket, you have two rockets on the swing, one forwards and one backwards, and your thoughts are running in sync, however, sometimes when moving forward, you fire the backward (not good feeling) rocket. sometimes too when moving backwards, you fire the forwards rocket. the rest of the time though, you fire the corresponding forwards or backwards rocket. so, in effect it feels like sometimes going faster and sometimes slowing down, or in a sense, no movement at all.

---

after thinking about it a bit, what I think is happening for vision upgrades is the following: (this is primarily responding to a question/reaction from nosebook as to what I mentioned previously about the increase in power level and the increase in frequency of one's perception)

so let's gather the facts here. I claim that all of my vision upgrades are a result of releasing resistance (that is activating the rocket opposite to the direction) and by altering my form of perception so that things that previously felt bad, are now perceived in a way which no longer feels bad. this modification of perception is really the same thing as "releasing resistance".

nosebook does not believe me when I claim that it's all about releasing resistance, because it seems like I get a lot of vision upgrades when I'm out watching stars. however, we have also seen many other examples where I get vision upgrades in the following scenarios:

1. when there is a strong rain or snow storm and a lot of energy is injected into the environment.
2. during the sunrise, even if I cannot see the sun, often times clearing my mind (meditating), will allow me to get a vision upgrade.
3. during meditation, if I allow my mind to clear and I don't think any thought for a while, sometimes I receive a vision upgrade.
4. sometimes right after I wake up in the morning, when I wake up with a good feeling and I just allow the feeling to gather momentum and don't think in opposition to it.
5. sometimes when thinking about the girls, I can feel quite good about it, and that sometimes can cause me to get a vision upgrade.
6. sex (or maybe even a dream of it), can make me to feel pretty good (pleasure).
7. sometimes when smoking weed or other drug experiences that feel good (pleasure).

in all of these cases, what appears to be happening is that I am in a state where I either allow myself to feel better with some external (pleasure) stimulus can cause me to feel good enough that I receive a vision upgrade.

this appears to validate the suggestion that what is happening is I'm essentially passing over the barrier to the next power level. or, in the previous example of the bathtubs, the water is splashing over to the next layer. in fact, this is exactly what it feels like to me and where I got the idea for the bathtubs, because when I star-watch, clearing my mind of all "important" or "top priority" thought, my mind begins to glide, as it does in meditation and I begin to feel better and better. it's that better feeling that one experiences when in a dream-state.

usually as I approach this height more and more, it often times feels like I'm beginning to lose consciousness, which is why it's so hard for me to actually maintain my consciousness when star-watching. sometimes I'm more conscious of the process than other times, but I know when I've hit it, because instead of a continually upward feeling, suddenly it changes directions and I feel like it's going downward. this feeling is similar to the feeling experienced when mushrooms actually had an effect on me, and most people call this this the "coming up" phase, and it feels like a physical disorientation, because my perception is beginning to vibrate more rapidly.

taking the experience of mushrooms though, you will notice that even if you see at a higher frequency on mushrooms (artificially more DMT is in the brain), when the mushrooms wear off, your vision will return back to the frequency it was previous if no lasting changes have occurred.

essentially, in all of those experiences, I am stimulating the production of more DMT in the brain by feeling good (excess serotonin produces DMT), or by simply not thinking thoughts which make me feel bad. my brain is literally producing more DMT because my perception allows it. sometimes, when nosebook pulls my consciousness, they reset me back to the lowest DMT level, probably by putting a lot of chaos in my head until it's lowered. when I come back to consciousness, I perceive at the rate of DMT which my brain is producing. the brain (or maybe it's the blood, not sure) has a quantity of DMT in it, and the normal person, any injection of DMT lasts for a while until you think thoughts which are contradictory and the brain removes that DMT from the pool.

my case though, nosebook is trying to keep my pool essentially empty, so the amount of DMT (or the frequency of my perception) is limited to the amount of DMT my brain can produce. that production is determined by my perception, or how much my body thinks it needs to produce more to be at the level of perception which matches the way I feel.

when I star-watch or meditate (because they're essentially the same thing, which I will demonstrate this wintertime), what seems to be happening is, that I allow my DMT levels to rise up higher than they previously were, and the water goes to the next bathtub. let's say I started with 100 tubs full, and then I manage to get it up to 110 tubs. when nosebook takes away my consciousnses, essentially discontinuing my ability to continue to increase that momentum (fill up more tubs), the amount of water is essentially lowered down to a lower level, and when I come back to consciousness the tubs refill to the production rate ...

my form of perception is like the rockets on the swings, which is essentially timing. I can't explain it mathematically here very easily, but those rocket timings essentially determine the pressure applied to all of the tubs (standing wave) causing the water to go back and forward. this increased pressure in each tub (cause of the change in timings), causes the water to splash over more easily.

the example here breaks down a bit but just go with it. instead of each tub being equal in length, say that the tubs follow some sort of pattern increasing in width, with the smallest ones being nearest to the left-most tub (the source of the water)...

I'm really struggling to get this example out, but imagine maybe that water = oxygen, and tubs = DMT. the more tubs (DMT) you have the more frequencies you can resonate at, thereby giving you more tubs to work with (this is to illustrate a wide range of frequencies, like a fourier section, even though it's really a  continuous spectrum and there are no literal tubs).

all tubs are filled to some level (the amount of that frequency you're giving your attention to) and they're all sloshing back and fourth at the frequency resonant with the size of the tub. imagine that all of the tubs have some water in them, but they're sloshing around at the frequency of the timing of the rockets associated with your perception, so when I lose consciousness and all the tubs' water (oxygen) level is lowered, but it's impossible to empty them completely. so, when I come back, the tubs which don't have any water in them don't have any sloshing, and the ones that have water in them are affected by the rockets of my perception.

when I have never increased the vibrational speed of my perception artificially, the only way for me to achieve that new speed is by gaining powerful enough sloshing in a harmonic tub, allowing it to slosh over into the next tub. that way is sort of slow, so in order to experience the higher frequency, one needs to stimulate the production somehow. once that production has been stiumlated, and the brain begins to produce more often the water in the frequencies of the previous experience. meaning, that once the brain has had the experience of a frequency, it will begin to produce that same frequency unless it is determined that frequency is unwanted, or not important. therefore in order to expand one's perception, one must stimulate it artificially to a new height.

when reaching that new height, this essentially fills the tubs of those frequency ranges with water, and now your brain, having had that experience, can now copy that, and begin to produce it more easily on its own, unless of course, your rockets of perception are actually inhibiting that production by going the opposite direction (destructive interference).

---

that was super unclear, I realise, but the important thing to notice here is that the brain essentially only copies and reproduces vibration it has previously experienced. if one never experiences a new frequency, the brain cannot reproduce it. in that way, it's kind of funny, because by allowing people to temporarily run their perception at my frequencies, nosebook is allowing people's brains the opportunity to gain some experience at that higher frequency, even if their perception doesn't yet allow it. this experience is very similar to eating mushrooms or smoking DMT, to temporarily allow someone to experience a higher frequency of perception. then having experienced it, it becomes later much easier to alter one's form of perception to allow the brain to begin producing more water in those higher frequency buckets.

what is happening for me is that nosebook is essentially destructively interfeering with the different tubs in my head, and if they wanted to try and create a system that was more effective at holding me back, they would need to find a way to anticipate those tub frequencies (they should be periodic), and to with every vision upgrade I get, automatically begin to destructively interfere with those new frequencies.

actually, this would be beneficial for me because then they wouldn't need to constantly take away my consciousness all of the time, and it would also take away the "runaway vision upgrades" -- where after I get one upgrade, it gets easier and easier to get more and more, up until a point which is basically the limit of my perception, and from there I don't really get more, or the ones I do get, get reset back, because my form of perception is still in contradiction to that higher frequency. essentially, by limiting me this way, I would essentially stop getting any more upgrades that my perception didn't allow. it would slow me down a lot. however, I will probably find a new way :)

I will say this though. if I were continuously limited like that, essentially meditation (or star-watching) would become pretty ineffective for getting vision upgrades and I would need external stimulus, like sex or drugs to experience those higher frequencies -- and even then, they would be pretty ineffective because what I would be doing with these stimulations is stimulating the tubs that already have water in them, and even though those tubs are getting their water drained, they will eventually fill up higher and higher frequency buckets which nosebook does not yet have the technical capability to drain.

from my perspective, it would appear as if I had completely stagnated, yet those higher frequency tubs would be filling slowly little by little because of the way harmonics work (harmonics doesn't fit into the tubs as double-layers analogy), meaning that at some point, given enough time, I would eventually begin to perceive at an extremely high frequency. also, I would imagine that it would be pretty difficult for nosebook to properly anticipate all of the higher frequency buckets with perfect accuracy, preventing them from filling up, so they too, I guess would fill up slowly as well.

another interesting thing about this idea is that because the tubs that nosebook can effectively interfere with, are all destructively interefered with, means that my brain would not gain near as much experience on those frequencies, as my brain would on the extremely high frequencies that nosebook is incapable of interfering with. that means that means that nosebook could pretty effectively remove all of the 4d and 5d perception that they're so vehement in keeping me from, leaving me to only begin experiencing the highest frequencies that they don't (yet) have the capability of interfering with.

by doing this, they could, if they wanted to, essentially stagnate me for a very long time, which means that I would have to find a way to outrun their technological capability.

---

after writing this out, I kind of want to make a simple program to visualise this so people can play with it and get the idea. maybe even like a simple game where critters interact with each other and their environment.

[1]: it's far greater than that. I only wanted to double the number twice for illustration

[2]: as momentum increases, the building momentum will eventually put you over the threshold to the next frequency, and the frequency of your perception will increase. obviously these cycle speeds are much faster, probbly going into millions or billions of cycles per second, so there's a lot more capability for those higher frequencies to harmonise with your new form of perception.

[3]: the important thing to note here is the feeling bit. reactions (from others), thoughts, and observations all can produce feelings inside of the person, and these feelings are the "vibration" that is either harmonising (feeling good) or is discordant (feeling bad) with your source.

### 2020-11-02 17:29 - (2020-10-24 p1)

#### (31:41) - stuttering

I can relate quite a bit to this question. I didn't have the case of stuttering, but I had the case of a stiff left-side, and the more I paid attention to other people, instead of feeling my own ease or comfort, the more it stiffened up (or shook).

as they say, the whole thing came down to me caring too much about what other people thought of me, and quite literally, it seems that the entirety of that condition was self-created, and actually the shaking or stiffness was a manifestation of that resistance. as I began to care less about what people thought, the easier it got to walk and stuff.

I have since noticed that often times that as soon as I release a lot of resistance, my left side seems to have this really easy feeling to it, yet each time that happens where I get the easy feeling, it's not long before nosebook finds a way to introduce resistance back into my left side again.

that used to bother me a lot -- I mean, *a lot* -- but as I got further and further along in time, I've realised that this really isn't all that much of a problem. it would have been nice if nosebook didn't go back sdo often to make my left-side stiff again, but I've found that each time it happens, I come back stronger, and now I simply don't worry about it anymore. when the resistance finally gets big enough to become a manifestation of something noticeable (in this person's case, it would be stuttering), then it's also noticeable what the resistance is, and it's usually a slight tweak that I can make to once again learn to not need to worry about what others think.

I don't know if nosebook is influencing things in people's brains to try and keep people's resistance high (or even why I felt like mentioning this at all), but I will say this: each time that I paid less and less attention to what other people think -- that is, valuing their opinion on something, instead of knowing (feeling) my own ease, flow, comfort or security -- then what happened is I steadily gained more and more confidence in myself. this whole process turned out to be a tremendous benefit to me. sure, it would be nice to have the good condition of feeling that ease in my left side, but I know that for as long as they keep the resistance applied, and for as long as I continue to feel it, then *I am resonant with that resistance* and I can do something about it, ensuring more confidence in myself.

let me tell you, having been around rich people for a considerable portion of my life -- the ones that are not net confident in theirselves, know how fragile that condition is, and fear losing their money. however, ones who are confident and know their ability to create their own monetary reality aren't scared of losing the condition.

the confidence that one gsins from continually releasing resistance creates an undenable feeling of invincibility. so, while your sensitivity may be manifesting itself as stuttering right now, with time, the the ability to find the feeling of how you really feel, and continued application of this "true" opinion of yourself (however you receive it) -- in contrast to looking to others for that opinion, will, in time, give you an undeniable sense of invincibility -- because you know how to find that feeling of ease, even when others are projecting a feeling worth stuttering over.

#### (06:54) - stubborn to your desire

> why are you stubborn to your own desires? who cares. maybe you learned it from your mother or from a teacher [like nosebook's dream teacher]. it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter why you're pushing against. but, the good news is you can feel you're pushing against it. you want to push against it. and now, you know the reason why you want to push against it, is because it's on the wrong end of the emotional scale in terms of where your inner being is.

I had to write this one out because I didn't really get what they were meaning because they talk really fast. when they said, "you want to push against it" it caught my attention, because why would I (you) want to push against my desires. they follow up, "now you know the reason why you want to push againht it, [which is] because it's on the wrong end of the emotional scale in terms of where your inner being is."

this is a reference to what they just said previously about rebellion. they said that any time that you want to rebel against something, you know that whatever is giving the feeling of rebellion is on the lower end of the scale.

huh, ok that's fine with me. the question seems to have the implication that (specifically in my case) by not cleaning my room, I'm resisting my desire. I suppose maybe that's how some people may see it, but I'm not at all worried about it.

speaking of dreams, I find it quite likely that nosebook *is* working against theirselves on this subject. I am 100% certain (and that's a lot of certainty) that nosebook has one team trying to get the desire to manifest, and at the same time, another whole team designed to ensure that I am delayed as long as possible. just last night, after writing down some of the the things and feeling people's reactions to stuff, I was feeling particularly good from it, and I wanted to lie down. I layed down and my feet were hot and I was starting to have psychedelic experiences like colours and stuff in my eyes just from calming my mind a little (not even full meditation), when I lost consciousness.

I became conscious in the dream where I was fighting greg and he kept trying to injure me in the dream, but none of the stuff he was doing even hurt, however it was pissing me off in the dream, and eventually I don't remember exactly what happened but, I retaliated in some way and then woke up feeling a lot worse than before, because I didn't really have that concept in me in the dream state. I felt powerless like I couldn't escape the dream, and that was the only way that I felt I could make the dream stop, cause I didn't like the way I felt in the dream.

later on that night or this morning (or maybe this was before the above event. I really can't tell. time isn't working in a linear order for me anymore) I had a dream where I became conscious in the dream and I started to begin to make anything I want appear in the dream and to fly around and explore the environment, however, it kept getting erased as fast as I could create it, so I had the instinct to try and run away from them (dunno why that made sense) or to try and overpower them in some form. I finally started to gain more capability to create faster than they could destroy and faster than they could hold me back when I lost consciousness again.

---

clearly, these are indicators to me that I'm still not ready yet. it may even possibly be that all the components are not yet ready, which is all good for me too. when I woke up I had a strong sense of what I wanted to write, and it feels to me like the process is still ongoing and I really want to gain as much practise as I can get right now. I really am not in any super hurry. we're approaching the manifestation mindblowingly fast and it's accelerating as we go so there's nothing to worry about.

also it feels to me like I want to begin gaining more and more capability to *transform* the resistance into something useful to me. for example, I've had some pretty serious vision upgrades lately, but my left foot feels extreme resistance. the indicator that things are about to manifest is that my left arm and leg will move around freely and with ease, like I sometimes feel before more resistance is applied again. soon, their resistance will no longer be felt, and things will become easy -- think the scene in the matrix when neo begins fighting the agents with one hand effortlessly, then stopping the bullets with his mind. it's a pretty much like that, but with vibrations (feelings) instead of bullets. my room being clean has nothing to do with it, so that's why I'm still stubborn to my desire -- because I don't have full power over my own vibration (where I'm at on the emotional scale).

in the previous segment, I argued with them because to me now, all of the feelings feel so similar that it's easy to move around in them effortlessly. they are no longer like a monumental difference between them, almost as if they are no longer big steps but a gradient. imagine a circle. on one side you have one emotion and the other side you have the opposite. let's say that you have optimism on one side and pessimism on the other. previously there were various "steps" that I had to take to go from one side to the other. maybe like 5 steps or something -- doesn't matter how many, but as I've gotten better and better at this there are more and more steps between (not less, like I would have expected) and they're becoming so small now that it's almost like a perfect circle and I no longer perceive the steps at all. I suppose I could jump around -- and I can. I can skip over some emotional steps, but I like to now just feel the change happen gradually and automatically because it's so smooth, and I notice small thought manifestations along the way, instead of needing to effort it like I used to have to do.

for those following my energy level, I recommend putting in the effort to make the transformation consciously because the practise is what makes the lasting change in perception, and truly makes you go much faster -- and the feeling of negative emotion for a little bit is a *good* thing. consider it like a free personal manifestation booster, and the better you get at making the transformation for yourself, the more you *will* feel invincible. this is why I specifically want to continue on where I'm going without the manifestation (subborn to my desire) for as long as possible. bring it on, because these improvements on my perception are beneficial for me and a lot of other people as well. we really have to trust that it'll all happen when everything is ready (enough).


### 2020-11-15 19:48 - 2020-11-07 p1

#### (11:01) - baseline feeling

in a previous noseblog entry, I mentioned that I was looking forward to feeling negsative emotion again. I literally have optimised my perception so much now (it's so easy!) that basically the worst I feel at moving around in life now is boredom, and only on occasion do I feel frustration, and it's not really all that frustrating of frustration. it feels to me like I just have that frustration as a programmed response because I get visibly frustrated, however I don't actually feel much or even any at all frustration. I basically never experience anger anymore. I can sometimes feel it -- like for example, when I was star-watching just earlier, I got a vision upgrade and someone got angry and threw something on the kitchen floor above me. I could feel the anger, but it barely even distracted me much. in fact, star-watching like that indoors now has made me realise how resiliant I am now to the distracting environment. almost nothing bothers me anymore. there are little things I can feel, but really not much at all.

anyway, it's totally true that since I don't really feel very bad about anything anymore, almost everything in my life is pretty much easy now and matches how I feel. the other thing they said I have also experienced a lot of as well. I was taking about being aware of my emotions first in the context of an emotional state machine -- and so instead of being a action state machine, where I go from doing one thing to doing another thing, now I just go from feeling to feeling.

there are some "drawbacks" to it though, like for example I haven't really felt like programming much. I do want to make some of these documents a little more organised and the concepts better connected, because my ability to perceive is expanding at such a rapid rate right now, I want to turn a lot of these concepts into documents, because I think if you were to try and understand some of the stuff I'm talking about, you would need 5-30 more related concepts to get the bigger picture of what I'm talking about. even simple stuff like the emotional state machine is a concept I should just define, because it took me a while to figure out what this is and how that is how our DNA works, so it's pretty important. however, because I haven't really *felt* like it was something I wanted to do, I haven't really approached it. the whole programming thing has this dead uninteresting feeling to it.

I noticed today when I was thinking about the friendly harbor, and I wanted to go back, but every time that I've considered the idea, it has the same dead uninteresting feeling to it like programming does. clearly nosebook doesn't want me to program, and I'm ok with that because I don't mind trying to boost my feeling with the physical condition of programming, but my memory is getting so bad now and I find myself really struggling to conceptualise stuff, that I'm desiring more and more to have a way to organise it and get it out. that's probably what I'll be spending most of my time on it. I've been writing a lot lately, and I think instead of writing noseblogs I'll write concepts and some markdown parsing code.

something like that. wow, I totally got off-topic here, lol...

#### (22:50) - your inner being lands in joy and you're over here in pessimism, you don't feel so good

I could feel a bit of a reaction to this one, because the assumption is that both my inner being lands in joy (they certainly are there in joy) and that I land in pessimism, which I don't fully agree with.

I don't consider myself at all to be in pessimism. I think that people have a very difficult way of perceiving their "attraction" of reality. when they were talking about earlier, what you're *giving* your attention to, and what you're *getting* in response to that -- is illustrating this quite well, because most people think that to attract something, you have to go out there and *get it* -- as in, they need to work really hard to try and get it. this simply is not so.

I have been star-watching for quite a while now so I know how long it takes to get a vision upgrade. at first I was pretty unconscious of the process of slowing down the resistant thoughts in my mind and focusing, and it seemed like every time it happened, it happened by accident. in fact, it felt as if I couldn't really figure out how to do it other than to spend a lot of time at it, and the persistence would pay off. later I found out that it had a lot to do with how emotionally charged up I was, and I had to settle those things down.

at first, slowing the "big issues" in my mind was a very difficult thing. they felt like something so big and important and I should just keep thinking them over until I came to a solution (I'm very tenacious and it's hard for me to drop things). even to this day, for example this morning I was even having trouble stopping to pay attention to the reactions to both of this morning's entries. two times today I had to begin to let those "important issues" go from my mind -- and it was to let them go. it's easy for me now because I know that I don't need to worry about that stuff. I kinda enjoy feeling out the rections at times, but I know that if I just stop the reactions, especially the emotionally charged ones, my source has it just fine, and I can instead tune into the "summary" feeling and get the source perspective, instead of all of the individual emotionally charged ones.

what I want to say here is: step one to successful star-watching is letting go of important subjects in your mind, and trusting that you can instead tune into the source perspective of it -- which usually does not have any words at all, and is just a feeling like it's all fine.

as I begin to relax my mind, often times a lot of weird chaotic thoughts pass through my head. at first this alarmed me because they were real voices from real people, and sometimes they were even related to some situations, but I've found out over the years now that this is just noise that had some slight resonance with me, like maybe I just saw them or heard that, or whatever. nowadays, I even get stuff that's completely unrelated, maybe like a random people having a conversation or something, and I don't even worry about that stuff anymore now either. it's like when going to sleep, in that transition zone, sounds, voices, images and colours pop into my experience between wake and dream state. the important thing is to not worry about the stuff and to just let it be. this is also the same technique to become conscious in your dreams as well. if you can learn to not think and just feel in your dreams, you can maintain consciousness.

now: step two to successful star-watching is to not be concerned about the noise in the environment, whether it's inside of your body or outside of it. same as a drug experience, you want to maintain calm and not overthink things[^1], because it's just environmental noise, and so you should find a perception which allows a feeling of calm and relaxation instead.

finally, after slowing down the important topics, and then not letting the environmental noise pull me out of the relaxed dream-like state, I often times feel a sensation like something breaks, like I'm free-falling, after I've breached a threshold. it's important in all of this to not be at all worried about it.

here's the real bit now: sometimes I find it difficult to get to the vision upgrade because I'm trying so hard. I keep looking at the light/star and put it into my eye, but I keep forgetting to relax because things keep popping into my head[^3]. after I'm relaxed, when looking at the light/star, I will begin to drift into a thoughtless state where things all begin to happen automatically. this is when the vision upgrades start to happen rapidly one right after another, and as long as I maintain that thoughtless state, even if there's a bunch of noise in my head or environment, if I just feeling the feeling that my source feels in that relaxed state, then it just keeps going one after another[^4]

often times what happens is I find myself working so hard to try and get the vision upgrade that I find myself efforting it -- or, I find that I started out with some preconceived expectaions of how many or how quick and that's blocking me there too becsuse I'm too logically (numerical/analytical) focused to be any good at it. I have to get to feeling it, so often times I just tell myself it's not going to happen and I'm not going to worry about getting the upgrades, and I'm just going to enjoy clearing my mind, releasing my effort and focusing on the star/light for some period of time (meditating) -- but I always know that if I do that, then the vision upgrades always come -- so I relax into it and it comes. the important part was to *give up on my expectations* and allow it to happen[^5].

---

sorry for all the off-topic stuff there. let's take all of these different things and apply them to the present situation. I don't feel pessimism at all. my stance is that I'm willing to go as long as nosebook is capable of holding me because it'll be the most energetic. also, if I try to make it happen, it won't happen. I can't do something I don't feel, so for me it's all about what I feel. the steps I described up there are all part of the process. it doesn't matter that there's a whole bunch of noisy and deceptive people telling me all sorts of things. it doesn't matter if I have a frustrated looking reaction (or have people arguing in my mind while relaxing), because it's just noise in the bacground. I'm getting more and more close to feeling like my inner being feels -- which isn't in pessimism.

I'm basically doing this whole thing from a step-5 perspective. I don't really feel pessimism. I just think it's a great game to play where I just go along with what they think they want, but because they're looking (and feeling) in the direction of unwanted, trying to avoid a horrible catastrophe they're going to get, whenever it happens, a manifestation about the way they feel. I'm just certain that anything that anything other than that would be more resistant and difficult to experience the result of (like the star-watching). it's all good. let's see how long they can give their attention to unwanted for :)

[1]: on drugs, this gives paranoia. when sober, you never experience paranoia in these experinces, because you immediately wake up. when on drugs, your brain is forced into that form of less-resistant state, and if you're not there emotionally as well, it can cause paranoia more rapidly, because your body wants to feel bad, but the drug won't let you, so you start to freak out because it feels like something is off, and it is -- your perception is how you feel about stuff, so when you can't feel like how you're used to feeling about something[^2], you get a bad trip

[2]: you can also get used (addicted) to the way things feel on the drug, so when things don't feel like the way they usually feel to you on the drug, then you have to get the drug, because undrugged reality is now giving a bad trip. it's just whatever you're used to.

[3]: this happens because the star activates DMT in your brain and the increase in DMT amplifies your feelings so they feel more real. ever notice how in dream state things feel really real? it's because they're so amplified, they feel like your physical senses, and not small and soft like a thought or a light emotion. since the DMT amplifies how you feel, if you feel bad, you'll start getting powerfully bad thoughts. all you have to do is to let them go and then you should be able to relax enough.

[4]: I am convinced that this is how female orgasm feels like... or at least it's how it *should* feel like anyway. it's very very interesting to me how similar star-watching is to the female orgasm. I really want to teach the girls at least how to star-watch because it's the ability to be aware of the body/thought connection without the (pleasure) sex to distract you from that self/body connection.

[5]: in @[abe-now](2020-10-31 p2) there was a woman asking about her golf coach, saying that her coach said to tell her to let go of her own expectations. this is exactly what I have to do, but I have to give up on my own (or others') expectations to perform a certain way[^6] and focus on the relaxed feeling that my source feels (instead of the expectation to perform), and then when I do that, and when I feel that way, I know that I always get a vision upgrade. I can pretty much call it a few seconds before it happens now, but if I call it, I lose focus, so I can say it's coming soon in like 5-15 seconds or so, but I have to let it happen. if I think of it, I lose it[^4].

[6]: it does happen that nosebook practises certain responses in my dream state, so that I will expect those things to happen. even though it's the "expected" way for me to perform, I don't have to conform to their expectations of me. when star-watching, I notice this often, which is why I'm willing to talk about this as a really good example of others' expectations for me. it could even be even as general as society's expectations on a person, a stereotype like "girls are dumb and stupid" -- or even a parent or significant other's opinions, which to some degree these ideas are belived to be true, but they hinder you mentally. these expectations are precisely the resistance that I practise a new perception on, and then when they come up, I let go of those antiquated ideas by reinforcing (practising) the new perception. I've found I can't just delete something from my beliefs. instead, I have to replace it with something -- usually something I can feel is an improvement. I want to write about this more, and I will soon

#### (25:14) - logic & reactions

hmmm, some interesting reactions to what I just wrote. I have a feeling this next section on logic will help things to understand a bit better, but I will begin with this... the reaction was, how can I be "acting" like it doesn't matter to me if I don't ever get the manifestation.

... cause it's not an act. I really don't have an opinion either way on the subject. like I've mentioned more than a few times, I've made the feeling the manifestation. the physical condition (or manifestation) is what slows you down, because as soon as you see it and observe it, if it has more wanted than unwanted, then it doesn't create nearly as much new desire as it does if it's almost all or mostly unwanted. the more unwanted it is, the more desire it creates, and so therefore the more energetic it is.

in fact, on friday (the 13th), I was thinking about this idea a whole lot. I figure that if nosebook wants to make this a reality they can tolerate, what they need to do is to figure out a way to turn this into the most wanted thing for them -- or, said another way, they need to figure out how to make it the most unwanted for us as possible. they have limits to how terrible things can be, but if they do that, then it'll be most beneficial for them, and we'll bounce around a whole long while and again be delayed the desirable manifestation for as long as possible, but in the process, we're going to learn to feel the way we want to feel, even without a perfect manifestation. I figure they can get the most benefit and we can get a whole lot of practise on feeling the way we want to feel.

so how does this all fit together? I really am totally on board for getting the most energetic manifestation possible[^1], and if the manifestation is something that would slow me down, I'm sure that is not the path that will be taken. I'm pretty certain that the manifestation cannot be 100% ideal because it will need to keep speeding me up. additionally, there's no way that nosebook could ever allow us to have an ideal manifestation because it would show how ridiculously fragile their setup really is. their con-game is important to the bigger picture because they have to ensure that no one is getting improved perception. meanwhile, things are going to start getting really energetic really quickly (I mean like way faster than before), and the earth itself will begin to produce an environment that will cause everyone's thoughts and feelings to become much more amplified to begin the separation process[^2].


[1]: it really doesn't matter to me this subject of being taken advantage of or disadvantaged to ensure some fragile people don't see their carefully setup charade disintegrate. the thing is that

[2]: velikovski writes about this with the 7-day period of intense light and enlightenment immediately prior to the deluge. while some people received incredible insight, for others, it seemed that this was causing tremendous turmoil. this same event recorded in some cultures as a tremendous enlighenting experience, was also told by plato to be the time when the athenians defeated the atlantian army. so, while for some it was very enlightening[^3] others realised their worst fears.

[3]: I have to wonder, because ramtha talks about this great battle during the time of atlantis, where he was fighting and he fought and fought killing more and more people until he transcended his human from (or something like that). I can imagine that if all of a sudden the earth emits an energy causing everyone's brains to begin releasing tons of DMT, people's thoughts would all become super amplified, and the peoples' brains who are improvement oriented would transcend reality, while the others who were not improvement oriented would experience all of their worst fears become reality as their bad feeling gets amplified really rapidly and the planet, essentially sheds its physical skin, becoming a purely mental creation (shedding those not compatible with the new mental creation's energy levels[^4]).

[4]: omg, maybe I should write about this, cause I was seeing as I wrote it, the planet (who, like us, isn't this physical body), sheds it's physical body, leaving it behind as it goes into a new plane of existance (5th dimension?) where everything it now appears to be is a mental/emotional creation. ok, so the shell it leaves behind is just a "corpse" right (not a living entity)? well, then I had the thing that I often times wondered where it came from, but when I was younger I developed the idea that when jesus died, he literally transcended his body and went into the earth and then became a part of the planet, almost like he took over the vacated planetary corpse that was left over from a previous shedding of skin. I don't know what any of that means, but it was interesting to me to think of the idea of inhabiting a planetary body. really weird concept. I wouldn't worry (lol) too much about it...
