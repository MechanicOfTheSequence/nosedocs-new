### reborn deity

the solar influence is called "light" -- or the consciousness energy that imbues all things. this "light" is symonymous (in my opinion) with "source energy". as each entity has a source, which is the "perfected" or more desirable version of itself. and the (alchemical) process by which one goes about finding, harmonising (or tuning in) with this inner light is often times symbolised by a rebirthing process.

symbolically, this has been represented with he following common themes:
- the phoenix is a solar bird that dies and is reborn
- the snake, when it sheds its skin is a rebirthing process
- baptism as a rebirthing process

the different baptisms are:
- water
  - potentially, this could have included a NDE, as there is evidence that in the original baptimal process, the baptiser held the person under the water for an extended period of time, until they literally felt as if they were dying, had a NDE, and then were "reborn" when the baptiser pulled them out of the water. they "left their old self behind" in the water and were reborn into a new form of perception. (obviously the "light")
  - water baptism could also be significant to the female (water) energy being transmuted sexually into "light"
  - I would consider this to have it's effect of cleansing the imagination or the mind, refocusing a person to give their attention to the stuff that really matters.
    - it can also go the opposite direction as well because it's an amplifier.
      - for example, if a person is fearful, a near death experience can solidify more fear.
      - or, if a powerful sexual experience enhances the vividness of life expereince, and their conscoiousness still perceives the "importance" of things that don't feel good, after a strong "water baptism" experience, those things will feel extra bad.
- spirit
  - I would argue that this baptims is actually symonymous with the baptism of fire.
  - it could, however, be something kind of like an intermediate between the two.
- fire
  - this batism is said to come, when the consuming fire burns away the the "carnal" body and all that is left is the "light" body.
  - it can also be symbolic too of again sexual transmutation, of the fire "kundalini" rising up the spinal column.
  - this baptism is said to give one "gnosis" or unlimited insight into the unseen realms. the ability to know anything they want to, because it's no longer clouded by the misconceptions of the "carnal mind" or the programmed brain.

in my opinion, these are all wonderful symbols that have been passed down through the ages to describe a process that best understood as electricity or vibration. it is perhaps easier to transmit these symbols to more primitive minds than to give an explanation of how tesla coils work and stuff.

all of these same symbols can be found as well in the teachings of abraham, which are also taught from a different vantage point, however all of them reflect the nature of how electricity (frequency and vibration) operate. therefore, if you understand that you are a tuning mechanism, then all of these symbols of rebirth are just transformations on your perception, and that your world, your universe, is a reflection of that perception.

also, this rebirthing process can happen as often as you allow it to happen, and doesn't need to be triggered by a large catastrophe or some other undesired event. however, this is the most common occurance, and these rebirthing symbols speak to the "everything is working out for me" sort of thing, because even in the worst, most terrible situation, *everyone* has that immortal fire (symbolically given to man by prometheus) to continually rebirth into graeter and greater forms.
