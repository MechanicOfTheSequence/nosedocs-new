### reborn deity

the solar influence is called "light" -- or the consciousness energy that imbues all things. this "light" is symonymous (in my opinion) with "source energy". as each entity has a source, which is the "perfected" or more desirable version of itself. and the (alchemical) process by which one goes about finding, harmonising (or tuning in) with this inner light is often times symbolised by a rebirthing process.

symbolically, this has been represented with he following common themes:
- the phoenix is a solar bird that dies and is reborn
- the snake, when it sheds its skin is a rebirthing process
- baptism as a rebirthing process

the different baptisms are:
- water
  - potentially, this could have included a NDE, as there is evidence that in the original baptimal process, the baptiser held the person under the water for an extended period of time, until they literally felt as if they were dying, had a NDE, and then were "reborn" when the baptiser pulled them out of the water. they "left their old self behind" in the water and were reborn into a new form of perception. (obviously the "light")
  - water baptism could also be significant to the female (water) energy being transmuted and amplified sexually into "light"
  - I would consider this to have it's effect of cleansing the imagination or the mind, refocusing a person to give their attention to the stuff that really matters.
    - it can also go the opposite direction as well because it's an amplifier.
      - for example, if a person is fearful, a near death experience can solidify more fear.
      - or, if a powerful sexual experience enhances the vividness of life expereince, and their conscoiousness still perceives the "importance" of things that don't feel good, after a strong "water baptism" experience, those things will feel extra bad.
- spirit
  - I don't really know much about this baptism, however, my intuition tells me it's probably something like an intermediate between the baptism of fire and water.
  - I would consider this, likely to have its primary effect on the emotional body, however I don't know this for certain.
  - another concept is that the spirit is supposedly already eternal, and so this rebirthing process is probably most easily explained as the "reincarnation" of that spirit into physical form and this will happen indefinitely, as the spirit in all of us is eternal.
    - the eternal spirit, or source part of someone can be considered light, so in this baptism, light takes upon flesh so that the water (amplification of that light) and fire baptisms which come as a result of more light passing through an impure vessel (that is, the mind: imagination/thoughts) can occur in everyday experience, purifying the spiritual gold in the alchemical process of everyday experince.
- fire
  - this batism is said to come, when the consuming fire burns away the the "carnal" body and all that is left is the "light" body.
  - it can also be symbolic too of again sexual transmutation, of the fire "kundalini" rising up the spinal column.
  - this baptism is said to give one "gnosis" or unlimited insight into the unseen realms. the ability to know anything they want to, because it's no longer clouded by the misconceptions of the "carnal mind" or the programmed brain.
  - this baptism seems to have its effect on the heart, as when this happens, the heart seems to open up and gives a whole new centre of "feeling" which one cannot describe easily -- perhaps a strong connection to the people and the environment around them, in a tangible and visceral way, as if you share some sort of experience together[^2].

in my opinion, these are all wonderful symbols that have been passed down through the ages to describe a process that best understood as electricity or vibration. it is perhaps easier to transmit these symbols to more primitive minds than to give an explanation of how tesla coils work and stuff.

all of these same symbols can be found as well in the teachings of abraham, which are also taught from a different vantage point, however all of them reflect the nature of how electricity (frequency and vibration) operate. therefore, if you understand that you are a tuning mechanism, then all of these symbols of rebirth are just transformations on your perception, and that your world, your universe, is a reflection of that perception.

also, this rebirthing process can happen as often as you allow it to happen, and doesn't need to be triggered by a large catastrophe or some other undesired event. however, this is the most common occurance, and these rebirthing symbols speak to the "everything is working out for me" sort of thing, because even in the worst, most terrible situation, *everyone* has that immortal fire (symbolically given to man by prometheus) to continually rebirth into graeter and greater forms.

#### hermaphrodite qualities

the idea is that this light (or source energy) does not have masculine or feminine properties, and contains both male and female. the hermaphrodite is also associated with "ends of the spectrum" -- as it were, the hermes or most enlightened physical manifestation combined with aphodite, or the most intense passion (or desire) combined into one. the 1st and the 7th ray[^1], the crown and the root, the beginning and the end, alpha and omega, etc.

interestingly enough the story of lucifer is said that he surmised that he shall become greater than (desire/aphrodite) ... there are various versions of it:
- the stars of heavan (as bright or brighter than the other stars)
- YHVH (the beginning and the end)

... and then was cast down, to some (physical/hermes) place to work out (usually involving fire) the manifestation of that desire. that is, to burn away the unwanted "chaff" or undesirable bits leaving only the "light". this is essentially, the "baptism of fire" where after some "contrast" the rebirthing deity is rises again in a more pure form.

this entity, symbolic of the phoenix will go from the height of desire down to the depths of physicality to work out the true manifestation (light) of that desire.


[1]: or the 7 rays associated with the phoenix or solar diety

[2]: this is a very common theme in magic mushroom experiences, and other drugs perhaps as well. I have no scientific proof to back this up, but it seems to be activated when the person has high levels of DMT (and perhaps oxytocin enhances the effect) at the same time.
