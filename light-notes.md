# light notes

- stuart's law: powerful absorber = powerful emitter

emitted light is addative color (red + green + blue = white), yet absorbed is subtractive.. so like green paint on a white paper is light green (paint subtracts the emissive properties of the substrate), and green paint on a black paper is dark green.
