## premises that I assume to be true...
... and make all of these concepts easier to understand.

I believe that some of the peoples, but likely not all, had mental capabilities that were unmatched by others. seeing that there are so many things in very inaccessable places, I assume that they can fly (as suggested by all the winged and avian deities).

I also assume they had very good eyesight, and likely the ability to project thoughts into 3d space, allowing them to make pecise 3d plans and to produce work with such a quality. tesla is said to have had this capability, and I know from my own experience that this is certainly possible.

they were capable of astral travel and there was some sort of global consciousness. all around the world, some events were so notable that events (especially ones in the heavans, involving the plaetary gods) seems to be universal. they seemed to be able to fly around in the solar system, and potentially the galaxy as well. I believe this is a capability learned from "stargazing" or "staring" (staring directly into a star until an altered state of consciousness is achieved, and one is able to travel around).

additionally, it seems pretty likely that if they were so perceptive, they had the ability to perceive energy and fluid motion. one of the amazing things of these gods is their mastery of acoustic and fluid dynamics. my theory is that they literally were able to "see" it. you can see evidence of this in tesla's work as well. for example, the "tesla turbine" is an incredible invention that shows mastery and abiltity to perceive and manipulate fluids in the imagination. tesla's turbine is to fluid dynamics what these ancient stone boxes and monoliths are to acoustics.

### longyou caves longyou grottos

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJTCaBsUHs)

it seems evident to me that they were designed to store water or something with water.

#### interesting features

- in each of the caves, there appears to be a box shape is cut into the floor.
  - directly above those box shapes are always a diagonal ceiling
  - because the water keeps filling these boxes, they must be connected to some sort of water source like an aquafer
    - tesla's towers were built on aquafers and their connection to the water provided a huge ground connection for his transmission of energy
- the walls are not smooth, but do have sort of parallel curves along the length of the walls (parallel to the floor). in each of the curves, there are another set of lines perpendicular to the curves which mush have some sort of resonance to them.
  - if I imagine these caves being filled with some sort of energy eminating from the box in the ground, then these perhaps must be some sort of "wave guide" to make standing waves or something?
  - the walls are not precision and uniform though
- the entrances to the caves appears to me te be kind of like an upside down funnel. for example, the first one does not have any other caves above it, so why make pillars and a ceiling? instead, the entrance is small (roughly the same width as the box in the floor), and always has slanted wall(s) to it, which makes it feel more like a funnel.
- the walls of the caves are especially "thin" at times as well, reminding me of a tuning fork, where the tines are meant to vibrate at a certain frequency

### funnel caves and niches

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX65jt3sKYc)

I have noticed a theme in a lot of the caves that the caves have an entrance at the top of the rock and diagonal or curved surfaces that lead up to the opening. it seems like it would be a lot easier to dig a hole with the opening at least the same size as the floor, rather than go through the trouble of making it have a smaller opening at the top.

another interesting thing in that video is the niches, which are said to be for pigeons. I agree that pigeons have significance for various reasons (TODO: link robert's pigeon video), however, if they were designed for birds, I find it unusual that the niches would be in such weird places (some near to stairs or in tight passageways). it seems like some of the locations would not allow human and bird cohabitation at the same time.

another weird thing is, the shapes. for example, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=481), you can see the tool marks at the left side there and, clearly they have the capability to excavate rock with ease, so why not just use the tool that made the tool marks on the left side there, to just make the whole thing smooth and dome-like. additionally, none of the niches are exactly the same size.

it's interesting she draws the comparison to the pantheon structure in rome, which also has a funnel roof and different niches carved into the dome. the niches in this case however remind me instaed of the "false doors" which are found in south america, which are hallmarks of oldest civilisation (hanan pacha), which seem to have acoustic qualities to it, and were specifically designed by peoples with incredible acoustic capablities, like for example the chinchero (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpzBn5IAkHA)).

therefore, I will form the hypothesis that these niches were either designed with a specific frequency in mind, to create some sort of 3d intereference pattern. additionally, the appearance of both smooth surfaces *and* those tool marks in the same place also leads me to believe that the tool marks were also designed with some acoustic properties in mind.

### niches as pigeon homes

another case for the niches not being for birds is for example here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=436), @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=554), and @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=450). why would you make 4 oddly shaped niches for birds right there, but not on the other parts of the wall (which clearly has an opening on the roof)? they appear more to be the reverse of the "nubs".

following the idea of the niches being reverse nubs, or having something to do with the acoustic properties of the shape because there are many different shapes: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=447) and @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=457).

though in some places it seems to me like those niches appear to be more for acoustic properties (the funnel domes make me think acoustic), there does also appear to be a strong argument for domesticated pigeons, too: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=524). I think it may be both. tina suggests that possibly an older race with DNA manipulation technology domesticated pigeons at a very early time, and these rock caves were designed by them for the pigeons initially. it could also be that after some cataclysm, pigeons found these acoustic chambers, enjoyed how they felt and made them their home, so the people after the cataclysm thought that they were *only* for pigeons. it seems like both have valid arguments to them.

the stone type may have something to do with it as well, as these niches seem to appear mostly in limestone, and the nubs appearing in harder stone like granite and basalt.


### parallel tool marks

- in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0kKrr4Q0fU) tina notes that sometimes the walls are smooth and other times that they show signs of these tool marks.
  - 1:58 these marks appear to be intentionally made in a mirrored fashion. additionally, on the roof there, it looks like there is a focal point in the centre. I theorise that places like even the osirion were never completed, or that's evidence of the tool they used to extract the stone (different from the one in the unfinished obelisk). however, these tool marks appear to be intentionally focusing something somewhere.
- it's possible that the tool marks were actually created using some sort of acoustic or energetic signal. it appears that the rock has kind of chipped off, in a non-smoothe way, meaning that the rock chipped and fell away in parallel grooves. (which then had to be excavated).
- in one of tina's videos, she mentions the cave (which have the tool marks), do not echo. this might be an indicator that these tool marks are designed to *dampen* the reflection of the signal, instead of shape it.
- clearly this technique is not the same one as the one used in the unfinished obelisk
- in this temple, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/zzU747CveRo?t=514), I would guess that's a meditation chamber, which has that rough look to it. seems that if it were for meditation, those marks are to dampen the sound.
- here @[youtube](https://youtu.be/zzU747CveRo?t=420), the mix of smooth statues mixed with rough marks in a room similar to the one above gives me the idea that it is for dampening some sort of frequencies
  - clearly, they had the capablity of making smooth surfaces, so the rough parallel tool marks must have a purpose in a chamber like that
  - additionally, it contains a lingam in the centre and people around it, probably showing what should be happening in that room above.
    - lingams are often surrounded by a square base with a single small entrance or output, so with the lingam in the centre there, the entrance to the chamber would be the inlet/outlet for the yoni, which is the chamber itself.
    - you could consider that the person going inside the chamber (to meditate) is symbolically a lingam or the shiva energy
- additionally, if the air were very ionised and there was a lot of energy flowing, the ridges created by those marks would make a really cool looking effect, with the glow of plasma coming off of the walls like that

### geopolymer walls in peru

- clearly these stones were constructed from a geopolymer. however, at the same time, you have the example of the "false doors" and things like that etched directly into existing rocks, so while some of the construction technique is in the ability to control the quality of the stone and its shape with a geopolymer, they also clearly have the ability to soften stone and mould it to their desire. this geopolymer seems to be usually of a limestone quality.
- in @[youtube](https://youtu.be/x9S4CqY3eSA?t=1010) (and many other places), you can see that there are what appear to be "scoop marks" -- which visually look similar to the same marks which appear around the unfinished obelisk.
- tina suggests an idea which is that the stones on top were pressed into the bottom ones, which were still plyable. this seems to work, because I cannot see any other way that "lips" in the joinery could possibly be achieved. the "scoop marks" on the stones seem to suggest that they were able to soften the rock somehow, so once the rock is softened, then you would only need to apply pressure from the top to have the lip appear on the bottom. this also could explain the 3d curved intersections between blocks.
- it's clear that the blocks were all non-uniform for vibrational reasons. whether that is to mitigate seismic damage or because the structures theirselves were designed to be energised and emit some sort of electricity, is unknown. for example, similar structures are found in egypt as well, but I think that one was granite (osirion? or was it another temple?), and so this non-uniform technique of construction seems to be designed to withstand massive amounts of vibration occuring within its structure.

### limestone notes

- it appears that they have the ability to add and remove stone with relative ease. it's not immediately obvious that they can add stone, but there are clear examples of this, like @[youtube](https://youtu.be/OBkgI34mMH0?t=3428). you simply cannot carve out the stone all the way around those letters (that's phonecian), so somehow they had the ability to draw stone on to the tablet like it were some sort of ink. additionally, in many many sumerian reliefs (eg. @[youtube](https://youtu.be/OBkgI34mMH0?t=2147)), you can clearly see the detailed human figures "carved" into the stone but if the rock were soft, then, clearly at some later time, the stone was softened and then the cuneiform writings were simply pressed into the stone, as if it were soft as wet clay.
- these rocks that were "softened" seem to be limestone usually. it would be nice to get samples of these different tablets tested to see the rock composition (eg. if it was a geopolymer or not)

### zodiac symbolism
- paveen says these statues in this temple have reference to zodiac https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEYUs7HBv3s

### nubs (and reverse nubs/holes)

- nubs appear on both granite (eg. menkaure) and limestone (eg. peru) type stones.
- they seem to have something to do with balance. see reverse nubs here: https://youtu.be/CgFnRoFMHwQ?t=1069
- bunch of holes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEYUs7HBv3s additionally, the circular stone columns on the lower part look as if they need to be turned on a lathe to make those kinds of shapes, however, they are the same stone as the wall. somehow the builders had lathe-like tecnology *without* turning the stone!!

### reptialian symbolism

- sri lanka king ravana, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqi9mchzexw

### coral castle

- "obelisk" is taurus constellation. says: "made 1928. moved 1939. born 1887 in latvia EL"

### unfinished obelisk

- the explanation for why it was unfinished is because it has a crack in it, however, I believe this is false. it's unreasonable for me to think that the builders would see the crack on the top there, continue shaping the surface to be mostly flat, and then continue on extracting the sides of the obelisk all with that giant crack in the top. certainly they would have realised that there was a crack in the stone and halted extraction long before, and not continued on to extract a damaged stone.
- the next explanation (proposed probably sarcastically by dunn) is that during the extraction of the obelisk, too much force was exerted on the stone during its extraction and that's what broke it. plausible, I guess. doesn't explain why they didn't, after doing all that work, instead use the unbroken rest of it for other stone boxes or smaller statues or whatever.
- I do not believe those were the reasons why it was halted -- and  and does not explain why there are massive stone structures all over egypt and the rest of planet as well (aswan, balbek, yangshan, easter island, etc.) which were all in the middle of extraction really big monolith when something halted their work.
  - additionally, in all of these examples of halted construction, the extractions are always the biggest monoliths -- bigger than any of the finished ones, so it appears that globally, all over the earth, people were so energised as to think that they could create bigger monoliths than previously accomplished, when something interrupts them. this idea reminds me a little bit of the tower of babel in concept.

### 23° different east-west axial tilt

- karnak temple obelisk shows major heat damage on the bottoms of the obelisks, and they're all 23° off from present east-west, indicating that the planet had a different east-west than the present day east west. @[youtube](https://youtu.be/x1NyhSCq5_s?t=1264)
  - however, because the great pyramid is aligned to the east-west of today, these older parts of karnak must predate the great pyramid, or the great pyramid was designed in such a way to essentially set the new east-west after the cataclysm, and the planet assumed the alignment of the great pyramid.
    - I wonder how many other ancient (pre-dynastic) structures are off from present east-west
  - all of the damage seems to have come from the east, quite possibly at dawn.
    - this could indicate that these temples were built to resonate with the sun and attract its energy, it could have happened that in an already energised moment, attracting more energy could create an overload causing these selective heat damages to these energetic structures.
    - or, it could indicate that the structures were resonating bodies, and they essentially had some sort of life-giving plasma coming out of them -- almost as if the quartz inside of the granite were being vibrated in such a way to create pezioelectricity, ionising the air aruond the the structure.
      - if the air were very ionised, the extra energy produced vibrationally in these granite stone structures would actually begin to create arcs of electricity out into the ionised air and producing high amounts as well.
      - additionally, in the moment of dawn, the air is even more conductive, and if this energy were related to solar electricity coming in at the poles (the stuff that makes auroras -- the electricity coming from the solar "wind" energising the oxygen in the air), so when the sun's rays pass through this ionised oxygen in the air (I notice that the sun's heat feels extra hot, like it stings in this kind of air), then the eastern facing surfaces would potentially be more affected to accumulate this extra heat and arcing.
      - this was more intense on the eastern faces, facing the sun. which may be why the surfaces (but not the core) of these massive granite stones flaking off, or with other types of stone like alabaster, appear to have exploded off.

### indra = mars? & sign of aries = elephant?

- in a lot of indian temples, I'm noticing a large correlation with the god indra(?) and the elephant.
- in [acksblog](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/2017/10/07/how-mars-formed-the-continents/), he suggests that mars is indra, and had repeated interaction with earth, with a tidal lock positioning close to the himalayas
- I wonder if the zodiac symbol for aries (indra?) was instead of being rendered as a ram, but as an an elephant
- there is also a lot of transition from bull to elephant symbolism... for example, @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL1yYvKLfCA).
- hindu god ganesha is elephant
- in the procession of the equinox, the elephant (aries) would come after the bull.

### eagle defeating serpent symbolism

- @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcvLYfKfDK4): eagle holding smake in beak and talons

### lord shiva - supreme god

- often shown with a snake in hand and (dwarf) demon under the feet: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smQoJGDkHfo)
  - [hand positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nataraja)
    - (left back) holds agni (fire)
    - (left front) facing (right front) holds (elephant)
    - (right front) joins (left front) holding snake (serpent)
    - (rigwt back) holds a sound device (sound which created the universe) damaru (symbolises rhmythm and time)
  - left and right hands of serpent and elephant are joined
