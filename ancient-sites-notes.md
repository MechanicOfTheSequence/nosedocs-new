it seems evident to me that they were designed to store water or something with water.

#### interesting features

- in each of the caves, there appears to be a box shape is cut into the floor.
  - directly above those box shapes are always a diagonal ceiling
  - because the water keeps filling these boxes, they must be connected to some sort of water source like an aquafer
    - tesla's towers were built on aquafers and their connection to the water provided a huge ground connection for his transmission of energy
- the walls are not smooth, but do have sort of parallel curves along the length of the walls (parallel to the floor). in each of the curves, there are another set of lines perpendicular to the curves which mush have some sort of resonance to them.
  - if I imagine these caves being filled with some sort of energy eminating from the box in the ground, then these perhaps must be some sort of "wave guide" to make standing waves or something?
  - the walls are not precision and uniform though
- the entrances to the caves appears to me te be kind of like an upside down funnel. for example, the first one does not have any other caves above it, so why make pillars and a ceiling? instead, the entrance is small (roughly the same width as the box in the floor), and always has slanted wall(s) to it, which makes it feel more like a funnel.
- the walls of the caves are especially "thin" at times as well, reminding me of a tuning fork, where the tines are meant to vibrate at a certain frequency

### funnel caves and niches

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX65jt3sKYc)

I have noticed a theme in a lot of the caves that the caves have an entrance at the top of the rock and diagonal or curved surfaces that lead up to the opening. it seems like it would be a lot easier to dig a hole with the opening at least the same size as the floor, rather than go through the trouble of making it have a smaller opening at the top.

another interesting thing in that video is the niches, which are said to be for pigeons. I agree that pigeons have significance for various reasons (TODO: link robert's pigeon video), however, if they were designed for birds, I find it unusual that the niches would be in such weird places (some near to stairs or in tight passageways). it seems like some of the locations would not allow human and bird cohabitation at the same time.

another weird thing is, the shapes. for example, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=481), you can see the tool marks at the left side there and, clearly they have the capability to excavate rock with ease, so why not just use the tool that made the tool marks on the left side there, to just make the whole thing smooth and dome-like. additionally, none of the niches are exactly the same size.

it's interesting she draws the comparison to the pantheon structure in rome, which also has a funnel roof and different niches carved into the dome. the niches in this case however remind me instaed of the "false doors" which are found in south america, which are hallmarks of oldest civilisation (hanan pacha), which seem to have acoustic qualities to it, and were specifically designed by peoples with incredible acoustic capablities, like for example the chinchero (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpzBn5IAkHA)).

therefore, I will form the hypothesis that these niches were either designed with a specific frequency in mind, to create some sort of 3d intereference pattern. additionally, the appearance of both smooth surfaces *and* those tool marks in the same place also leads me to believe that the tool marks were also designed with some acoustic properties in mind.

### niches as pigeon homes

another case for the niches not being for birds is for example here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=436), @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=554), and @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=450). why would you make 4 oddly shaped niches for birds right there, but not on the other parts of the wall (which clearly has an opening on the roof)? they appear more to be the reverse of the "nubs".

following the idea of the niches being reverse nubs, or having something to do with the acoustic properties of the shape because there are many different shapes: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=447) and @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=457).

though in some places it seems to me like those niches appear to be more for acoustic properties (the funnel domes make me think acoustic), there does also appear to be a strong argument for domesticated pigeons, too: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/XX65jt3sKYc?t=524). I think it may be both. tina suggests that possibly an older race with DNA manipulation technology domesticated pigeons at a very early time, and these rock caves were designed by them for the pigeons initially. it could also be that after some cataclysm, pigeons found these acoustic chambers, enjoyed how they felt and made them their home, so the people after the cataclysm thought that they were *only* for pigeons. it seems like both have valid arguments to them.

the stone type may have something to do with it as well, as these niches seem to appear mostly in limestone, and the nubs appearing in harder stone like granite and basalt.


### parallel tool marks

- in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0kKrr4Q0fU) tina notes that sometimes the walls are smooth and other times that they show signs of these tool marks.
  - 1:58 these marks appear to be intentionally made in a mirrored fashion. additionally, on the roof there, it looks like there is a focal point in the centre. I theorise that places like even the osirion were never completed, or that's evidence of the tool they used to extract the stone (different from the one in the unfinished obelisk). however, these tool marks appear to be intentionally focusing something somewhere.
- it's possible that the tool marks were actually created using some sort of acoustic or energetic signal. it appears that the rock has kind of chipped off, in a non-smoothe way, meaning that the rock chipped and fell away in parallel grooves. (which then had to be excavated).
- clearly this technique is not the same one as the one used in the unfinished obelisk
