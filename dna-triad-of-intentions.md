this morning after I woke up I had an interesting idea come across my head. it may be complete rubbish, but it seems to fit pretty well. I honestly doubt it's like this. however, I'll just say the idea and you can be the judge. this is just a draft. I repeat: it ***NEEDS FURTHER WORK***.

the premise for this is abrham's "triad of intentions": freedom, growth, and joy. the y-chromosome is the part I have most difficulty with because I don't understand my own. I figure it always encodes two or three of the aspects (not sure). the x-chromosome seems like it has one of the three as the dominant aspect (there could be secondary aspects I suppose but I'm trying to look at the extremes).

imagine now also that a chromosome is a sort of program which essentially encodes how to accomplish that objective. each person has a different way to go about that, and the way to accomplish these triads of intentions are encoded conceptually into the DNA.

when I say conceptually, I mean like if (for example) mom was really intuitive and enjoyed figuring things out and that was her path to joy, that may take on the appearance of an engineer or scientist. likewise, let's say mom liked things to always be in order and regimented and orderly, and that is what made her feel good, that would be encoded. a similar thing may be encoded in the growth aspect, so say she may feel it necessary to have everything orderly in order foh things to grow properly. [needs more work]

the last bit is that it feels to me like the y-chromosome is pretty well established and only the guy can change his DNA here. I seems like it'll get passed down pretty much unchanged. for men, the x-chromosome feels like it's a mix of the mother's stronger aspects competing with the y-chromosome's stronger aspects.

the x-chromosome, I feel is very mutable and quite easily modified (eveything from emotion and environment can affect it greatly) -- which, in contrast to the y, which I believe remains relatively the same.

---

this is the part where I put on the speculation goggles. be advised.

I have always found men to be quite difficult to understand and this sort of explains it because by nature they're always divided between freedom and growth/expansion. I think it's possible that most girls contain a joy component and this is what makes them so attractive to men (and other women). since the joy component encodes the method by which the person "finds joy", they will inherit a lot of the conmept of joy from one of their parents.

I can notice for example the way that I perceived freedom used to be much more like dad. however I've completely rewritten that code because it didn't work. when I say freedom, I mean the "freedom to feel how I want". most men think they need their freedom in physical conditions, like people not telling them what to do and stuff, however what this freedom is looking for is the ability to feel how one wants to.

the other one is growth and I think this is somewhat of a "flaw" (not really) in the masculine gene where it feels the need to expand and continue to subdue its environment so that growth can continue unhindered. the reality is, growth happens naturally, so the idea that one needs to "drive growth" or force it, is kinda silly. again, I've rewritten this one for myself. previously it was encoded that I needed things to be "going my way" so that things can work.

this is also a very interesting subject where couples tend to fight. the growth aspect is nurturing and desires for the continuation and expansion of the things that are important. very often these aspects clash because a masculine perspective of growth is very deferent than a feminine perspective of growth.

like I said, I think almost all (or all) girls have a joy aspect to them which means that the other one is either freedom or growth. I've never noticed (doesn't mean it doesn't exist) a freedom oriented woman (I want to feel the way I want to feel) in the same body as a expansion/growth/nurture woman. purely conjecture though.

back to men: I believe that mostly these guys are getting their joy aspect from their mom. I find that very few men are capable of finding their own joy in a strong way, so as a result I believe that aspect is almost always inherited from the mother. the y-chromosome just can't compete there. I think this may explain why so many extremely awful feeling guys have such a nice side to them. this was inherited from their mother and is to be protected, not allowed to be expressed very often because it if the soft-side comes out it could get pretty easily damaged.

I need to think on it more...
