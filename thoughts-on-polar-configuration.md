### thoughts on electric universe's polar configuration

this was a youtube comment reply, however, hopefully I'll eventually develop it into something more cohesive.

I'm aware of what they claim. however, I have a difficult time drawing the same conclusions that they do. velikovski proposes the idea that saturn was much brighter in previous times (during the golden age, etc) and was also responsible for the deluge:

http://www.varchive.org/itb/sunstar.htm

this would have had to have occurred within our solar system and means nothing more than saturn was a very bright "star" in the sky at that time (perhaps even perceivable in daylight if it were bright as the moon is today). I find this idea of saturn being much brighter than he is now and correlated with the golden age to be something that is evidenced by the "serpent bloodline" (which is associated with saturn) and the atlantians. the "eagle bloodline" is related to the athenians (or ancient greeks, hellenes) and is associated with jupiter. their great battle was recorded in the hesiod, and referred to by plato as well, and the overthrow of saturn by jupiter is recorded in greek and roman mythology.

again, this had to all have happened within this solar system, because without it, there would not have been a blackbody spectrum, and so therefore I would have to conclude that people didn't need their eyes or had some form of higher level of perception. it's possible, because I know that in really high levels of DMT (or LSD), people have reported to be able to see in the dark without needing light. many really archaic megalithic like the serapeum or the caves in china do not have soot on the ceiling, and so therefore must have either been artificially lit, or people were able to see in the dark just fine. neither can be proven, and it doesn't really matter either way for me. something of this sort may have happened which is recorded in genesis referring to adam (serpent bloodline)'s eyes being opened, and they realised they were naked. this could be the first time they perceived physicality.

however, my own research into this gives the indication that saturn could have radiated (when previously was that bright) during the "golden age" a much more vivid sense of perception which essentially allowed people to perceive things as it were "conceptually" (I see this as living colours and shapes) or perhaps even in very abstract symbolism (I have not yet seen this, but want to; I know it's there. I just haven't gotten quite high enough to experience it, yet). there is much evidence to suggest that such "spiritual vision" was interrupted by sexual intercourse or as plato puts it, the "mortal admixture" caused them to drop down from the mental or astral plane to begin to perceive the physical. again, this cannot be proven, so I don't try.

what I cannot figure out is how the electric universe "polar configuration" would integrate this idea. if saturn were the first sun, then the time this sun was captured by "sol" or replaced by jupiter would have had to have happened at "fall of atlantis" -- which is associated with the deluge, not the opening of adam's eyes. this also doesn't explain the many previous civilisations in prehistory that existed prior to the deluge.

it seems far more likely to me that saturn and jupiter were in the same solar system that we are in now, however at least saturn was much brighter than he is now -- and perhaps jupiter as well. associating saturn with the golden age and elevated perception has a lot of evidence to support that idea, and from the hight of that golden age "man" (adam) has fallen (decreased in perception). there is significant evidence to suggest that this is the case. in the sense that saturn provided at one time an elevated form of perception, where at one time the physical was not perceived in the same way it is right now also seems likely, and so in that sense, saturn could be the first celestial light of hightened perception. and when that was lost, it would be quite a notable thing, lamenting the loss and wanting to return back to the time of plenty when saturn was ruler of the (night) sky.

the term "draconic" (or dragon) means to "see clearly" and is associated with an elevated form of perception posessed by the serpent (or draconic) bloodline. this bloodline continues to this day in the majority of the world leaders today. saturn is definitely associated with an elevated form of perception, however, I it seems much more likely that saturn's golden age, followed by the deluge and jupiter's "silver age" events happened within this solar system.

She (like Sekhmet) was also the wife of Ptah and mother of Nefertum and the lion-god Maahes (Mihos) (who may have been an aspect of Nefertum).

sekhmet (venus) is wife of ptah (vulcan), and they had a lion child called maahes.

osiris (saturn), brother and husband of isis was remembered while in dominion as a time of bliss (golden age of saturn). seth (mercury) murders osiris (saturn)[^1] and isis recollects his body parts. osiris becomes lord of the underworld and isis conceives and gives birth to horus, the red one (mars/jupiter?) from osiris (saturn)[^3].

I'm guessing that some sort of prophecy comes about telling of the return (or something) of horus, in lion form, and this is visually represented to complete the prophecy when the sun rises in the east on the equinox in leo (sphinx statue), which is called "horemakhet" -- which is a combination of horus (mars/jupiter?) and maahes (the lion child of venus and vulcan).

assuming that the planet does not flip over again, this will happen opposite this aquarian (remember saturn/horus is remembered as being in aquarius during the time of the deluge) era 12000 years from now. or, if the world flips over, perhaps this aquarian era.

[1]: it doesn't fit in exactly to the sirian thing cause they state that the earth was in 3rd position when the mars mission began. however, I have always had this funny idea that mercury (seth) came about in the solar system as a result of the interaction between the great pyramid, our planet, whatever happened during that time (galactic current sheet?) and the deluge. this caused moses to then use the same technology to summon venus (lucifer) into our system. I find it interesting that in egyptian mythology, seth (mercury) murders saturn, and only after isis rebuilds him, he becomes god of the underworld (potentially also a reference to the adding of another celestial sphere, from the addition of mercury, and saturn becoming the god of what is now the inner earth). I don't know exactly what happened there, but my intuition seems to tell me that the great pyramid, thoth (after which the mercury is named) and something on earth happens around the time of the deluge[^2].

[2]: it just came to mind, that this could have been potentially the beginning of the physical planet "vulcan" when it begins to have influence on mercury (which seems to be a much older than 10kyo planet), yet has not yet, only being ~11kyo has not attracted very much material yet. perhaps it's the influential planet that was theorised to be "vulcan" -- but is actually the beginnings of this other guy, the sun of venus and vulcan, "maahes". I dunno, lol, all this stuff makes my head hurt cause it's so convoluted.

[3]: the red one is remenecent of the phonecians, etc. (eagle bloodline), which comes from (I think) when the serpent bloodline (annunaki) turned the land apes (homo erectus) into a hominid species (cro magnon: adams & eves). they then mixed with these eves to create the eagle line??? not sure that one is right. anyway, it sounds to me like isis recollected the parts of saturn (serpent bloodline) spread all around and combined them into the "red one" -- which was known in some places as jupiter (eagle bloodline) and in some places as mars (aryans/from aries). the red ones are also rememberd in the vikings, red haired giants, and the phonecians, redskins (native americans), etc.

another idea that just came to mind, is that if there were a way to create invisible, yet gravitationally significant spheres, such as something like "vulcan", where a planet like that (or a similar attracting force) needs exist there to cause the orbit of mercury to be so eccentric. a simiilar attracting force in the orbit of mercury could cause the orbit of venus to become very eccentric as well. I propose that this could have happened with electric influence from the great pryamid, and was done by moses who caused this to happen to make the exodus possible.

if this were possible, the venus' orbit could be caused to become so eccentric, it would be seen as a "comet" making a close approach to earth periodically, when earth's orbit lined up to coincide with the outermost reaches of her eccentricity. additionally, her orbit could even have become eccentiric enough to reach out to even the orbit of mars. venus' interaction with both earth and mars are recorded in mythology (they created harmonia and jupiter had to appease vulcan) and/or history (isrealites's exodus and interaction with hathor/venus).

Dumuzid and Geshtinanna begins with demons encouraging Inanna to conquer the Underworld.[63] Instead, she hands Dumuzid over to them.[63] They put Dumuzid's feet, hands, and neck in the stocks[59] and torture him using hot pokers.[64] They strip him naked, do "evil" to him, and cover his face with his own garment.[64] Finally, Dumuzid prays to Utu for help.[64] Utu transforms Dumuzid into a creature that is part eagle and part snake, allowing him to escape back to Geshtinanna.[64]

In the text known as The Most Bitter Cry, Dumuzid is chased by the "seven evil deputies of the netherworld"[64] and, as he is running, he falls into a river.[64] Near an apple tree on the other bank, he is dragged into the Underworld,[64] where everything simultaneously "exists" and "does not exist", perhaps indicating that they exist in insubstantial or immaterial forms.[64]

this is a story that is similar to the story of horus, where saturn is put into the underworld (night sky?) and is tortured, and deprived of his senses. saturn prays to the sun for help and turns saturn into a creature that is part eagle and part snake.
