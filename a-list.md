ok, after a few computer restarts, I'm just going to do it here...

---

anyway, in the middle of all of that overwhemment, a guy came over to me and got me to talk to him about mushrooms for a bit, and he was kind of pushing me to sort of leave, claiming that I was creeping out the girls, and I didn't really mind because I had already collected quite a few mushrooms, but what I was interested in was continuing on learning how to feel with that positional awareness. just in the few minutes that I was there, I went from not being able to feel much more than a kind of "soup" of stuff, to being able to start to actually tune into different almost locations.

it was really hard because, I could feel some desire and I could feel some other bits almost of discomfort[^1], but how in the world would I be able to tell from where it was coming from, right? I can't just say, yes to all of them and to figure it out or something because I was overwhemed. I thought of that as a solution, but decided against it, and to instead settle down and try to isolate and locate the different feelings. it worked surprisingly well.

so the guy kind of shoes me away and I go to walk home and I decided (logically) that because I thought I couldn't really get a good read, then I would just consider the event to be some sort of practice. however, the feeling persisted that I should try and make an effort to come up with something. I decided that I would just go with the ones that I could remember, or that made an impression on me. those were a blonde girl in the middle area, and a red-haired one pretty close to the same position, too. there was also one that I was feeling far over to the left there. I first sensed her when I noticed them and decided to, instead of walking through their group, to go the long way around to the tree with the mushrooms. thing is, I didn't get to really locate or isolate her very well, and I don't know much about her, other than black, probably her hair.

I'm just not good enough at this yet. I want to be able to practice more, because with the increasing difficulty, I just wish I could ... I don't know what I want, but I did enjoy the practice, and I know that if I got a bit of a longer chance, then I could get really good at it.

---

- around a week ago, nearby to where I cross the swamp, there was a white car with a man and a woman inside of it. if felt like they were petitioning for their daughter(?). I didn't feel it very strongly, but I explained why I think that was above
- I also noted that the reason why there were 3 random pairs of pants that showed up on the sofa up on the hill, was that they belonged to 3 girls. again, I think the reason why I couldn't feel them very strongly was for the same reason I mentioned above.
- on friday, after identifying the three girls that I could remeber, I kept feeling a something more, and I really don't know why, but I feel very inclined to invite the daughter of the man that talked to me about the mushrooms to join as well, if she wants to.
- minutes before this, and the reason why I decided to write this in this moment is because I was watching mom watch a NCIS episode, where there was a girls bike race that I thought was pretty hokey (hopefully I didn't think too many bad thoughts about it, lol), but I seemed pretty interested in the girl riding the bike[^4] and when I went upstairs to go get food, I felt very strongly that I should write this now and include her as well.

dang.

[1]: this is a weird thing, because it wasn't like bad vibes discomfort, but more like they were thinking that I was paying attention to what they were doing or analysing their performance or something. I wasn't. because of how weird things are with me and others watching theirselves through my eyes, I sense a lot of performance anxiety when I'm around people. it creates huge problems[^2], I try and pay as little attention to the exact movements, or sounds or whatever is being produced, and instead focus on the feeling. as long as I do that, which is hard, because sometimes, for example like with jon, I couldn't because he was complaining that he can't use his mind or something while I was listening to him talk. I was going to watch him and give him my undivided attention, but apparently that's too difficult, so I opted to just trying to listen in the background while doing something else -- but that didn't work either. so, I don't really know what to do about other people's discomfort, cept ignore isn't the right word, because I just focus on trying to feel the best feeling part from what is coming from them.

[2]: for example, it's hard to watch streamers because all I have is the ability to see them on the screen or hear their voice (I'm not in the same room as them, so their feeling is much harder to pick up[^3]), so I tend to hyper analyse their movements and their voice when they're streaming. this creates huge problems, like dani, jon, kripp, or thijs. the only one I really felt comfortable with watching was turbo knight, because I could focus on how the music sounded.

[3]: anyone who's learned another language would know what I'm talking about here when I say that it's easier to understand talking to someone in a language you don't understand very well, in person, and things like phone or skype conversations are considerably more difficult because so much of the non-verbal communication is missing.

[4]: there were multiple girls riding bikes, I know. I honestly can't remember now what all was even happening. I remember one went back to save a girl, and jaron made the comment, "that's why you shouldn't save anyone" -- and I remember black and pink, but that's it. that's all I can remember now from the whole thing, and I just saw it maybe 40 minutes ago... I can remember the feeling though. man, physical senses/memory these days is getting pretty awful, I admit. it's not *REALLY* that bad, I assure you. it's just a phase I'm going through. it'll get better again.

### 2020-09-25 09:58

real quick ones here. first, a few days ago I was walking back from the field and I saw a woman that was about where the tire I had erected on the top of the hill. I would like to invite her daughter to join if she wants.

then on the 21st, I went to go get my blood taken and I was chatting with the blood taker. I didn't think much of it and I honestly either didn't notice that she mentioned her daughter, or it was deleted.. anyway, a few days(?) later I remembered her, and I would also like to invite her to join in, if she wants.

:)

### 2020-09-28 18:24

yesterday I stumbled upon a great [youtuber named tina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxq9PsBVarBK9BpG9SYQF7w) and I seemed to be able to feel her quite strongly. I also really like her interests... she's totally invited if she wants to join in.

this morning when I was walking back to the house, I was putting my coat in my backpack and a noticed a girl getting in a truck. I wasn't quite sure I felt it well enough, but as time has passed now, I feel more sure about it. she's also wecome to join in too if she wants. :)

man, what a weird day, btw... :)

### 2020-10-02 10:55


a few days ago I was out on the field and I was in a dream when a girl showed up (I think she had blonde hair) and she presented me with the idea that she wanted to join, saying, "I can translate russian and roman for you" (or something like that). I was so startled that I didn't know what to think. a weird thing popped into my head where I was reminded that I can't say no to girls or something like that which caught me off-guard even more, so I decided to feel her to know that way instead and I liked the way she felt. I went to turn around and look for her but I couldn't find her; she had vanished but I could still feel her. I woke up (or maybe someone else woke me up) and I rememberd it so that I would write it down. it took me a few times to remember, but I didn't forget :) anyway, I'm assuming she's real cause of nosebook's response. that's pretty amazing! she's definitely invited to join if she wants to.
today while picking mushrooms in the park, there was a couple(?) that got out of a truck in the parking lot, and I didn't think much of it. however, when I got home I could feel some reactions to it and also feel her as well. anyway, I can feel her strongly, so, I concluded that if that was a thing, I'm want to extend the invite to her if she wants to join.

### 2020-10-02 19:35

just went down to the park with jaron cause I wanted to see the mushrooms. they weren't grown yet, but I felt like asking jaron if he wanted to stay a little while longer. there was a man and a girl in a purple shirt that walked by and greeted us. I didn't really get it at first[^1] -- not sure why it wasn't super obvious right away, but I got the message :) I'd like to make sure and extend an invite to her if she'd like to join.

[1]: was she was feeling shy? because I mean I did all of a sudden just want to go to the park, so she did attract it, which is quite notable in itself :)

### 2020-10-03 20:40

earlier today I went down to get some mushrooms because I came home early last night and slept here. along the way I could hear some girls screaming (not like screaming in pain or something, but more like to get my attention) around near to where carefree #3 house would be. I don't really have much go work with because I could only hear them and they seemed persistent enough that it was something that they wanted. I want to extend the invite to them as well, so they're welcome to join in too if they want.

### 2020-10-06 11:40

today walking back from the park there was a girl running along masari that I passed while I was singing DARE (by gorillaz). I didn't think much about it when it happened, but then when I got home I started feeling reactions. if she'd like to join in, I'd like to extend the invite to her as well :)

### 2020-10-12 16:13

a few days ago, I was reminded of a youtuber that I unsubscribed from, and it felt like I was feeling strong desire  from her. I decided to feel her out when I was out on the field and I really liked what I felt. it seemed to me unmistakeable that I should extend the invite to her as well. I went home and looked at her channel though and tried to watch some videos, but seeing the videos, I realised quickly that she felt, in reality, nothing like how I had felt her on the field. the problem for me here is do I follow my feelings, or not? my feelings have never been wrong, up until this point, and I've said on numerous occasions that I trust them more than my physical senses at this point, so this example puzzled me -- a lot. I have to just go on the faith that what I was feeling is some sort of echo of the future (pun intended), and that we'll just have to see how it turns out over time.

I thought to myself that actually this may be the case with some of the other girls as well, and I feel/felt them as different than they are in their now present reality (this has been carrying on for quite a while, I admit). I kind of like the challenge actually, because I can still get back there and remember what any of them originally felt like to me. I developed this capacity in relation to my programming, because I would have an idea, and before 24h had passed, nosebook would have pooped on it and it no longer felt like it originally did for me, so I had to constantly go back and find the original feeling and work from there. it's not hard for me, and I do feel her desire strong enough still that I think I do want to extend the invite to [echo gillette](https://www.youtube.com/c/EchoGillette) as well.

next, yesterday I was watching, matt parker's SNN (spreadsheet news network) bit on youtube and he gave a shout out to seth meyers and referenced the yu tbe clip. he got the timestamp completely wrong in the link, so I ended up watching the majority of the video. I was looking forward in the thumbnail preview of the videos when I saw what appeared to be family pictures or something (he was thanking people cause it was his last in-home taping) and upon seeing some of the photos, I felt some sort of attraction and closed the video immediately. however, the event has been "plaguing" me (showing up repeatedly, sometimes multiple times a day) for quite some time now. I honestly don't know what to make of it, and I feel resistance to going back to the video to try and figure out what it was that I was feeling so I'm not going to. I don't feel bad about whatever it is, so I guess, it's a yes, and I suppose I'll find out whatever that was about later on when things finally develop further. I do feel good about it though, so really kinda a weird experience.

last, when I was watching @[abe-now](2020-10-03 p2) video, at about the 39m mark a woman with 5 children writes in, and honestly I don't remember much of what the conversation was about, because I kept feeling strong desire from one of her daughters. I could feel one strongly, and perhaps there was a second one as well, but I'm not sure -- as you know nosebook is very good now at making sure I don't feel the physical sensation of those emotions anymore. I slept on it, and I feel good about it when I woke up, so I do want to make sure that the one I could feel strongly is invited.

### 2020-10-14 21:47

last night I had a difficult time getting up to go star-watch. there was a very memorable dream for me which happened though. I was in spain and the spanish were going to throw a huge slosher for me, and there was going to be a lot of drinking and a lot of kids there. I "knew" that this was fwh's attempt to kind of squeeze as many last inclusions in as possible. it was also really weird how it seemed to me that I "knew" that what had been happening was actually the opposite of what I thought... in all of the timelines that were setup, I was so successful, he (I) went back to alter them, not to reduce their scope, but to expand them further, with each expansion more and more girls were added...

anyway, knowing that, I was waiting for the most ridiculous slosher to start happening with a bunch of kids around, but it didn't happen. I can't remember much of why, but I think the dream got aborted, which is why I woke up. anyway, there was a little girl in yellow that was there at the end of the dream that I quite liked. I'd like to invite her to join in if she wants.

---

I realise this is a bit weird I suppose, as it seems weird that more and more girls are beginning to "invade" my dreams, but whatever; I'm gonna go with it. also, it's a bit weird too because the "knowledge" I had in the dream implies that we're heading into the final stretch here, but I think that's kind of obvious considering the rate of acceleration.

---

the next weird thing that happened just now, is today was I was listening to a kevin hart on youtube (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5ZqfulHMac)), and literally while I was writing this the thought popped into my head 3+ times now to include her as well. dude, like I dunno what's going on, but I feel good about it, so if she too would like to join, that would be great :)

### 2020-10-17 10:12

ok, starting off here, a few days ago there was a woman that was in a camper out on the field, and she met me on the ramp up from the swamp where a bunch of trash is on the ground. I have to assume that she was intending to request for me to invite her daughter, and I think it's fine. I feel fine-good about it, so sure :)

next, on thursday, I was walking down to friendly harbor. I was walking down the off-ramp to jerry murphy and I saw a girl in the car coming up the off-ramp. I think she was wearing blue. I could feel desire, so I want to invite her to join in if she wants to, as well.

finally, yesterday I met a nice girl at the friendly harbor named luna that I could feel most of yesterday and quite a bit of last night, until I lost consciousness. if she would like to join in, I felt a pretty good conncetion to her (btw I love that "natural consequences" idea, too. I think I'm going to "borrow" it :)) [EDIT: I felt a little resistance after writing it, and then I woke up and felt less -- like it was ok, but I think it's ok to let this sit for a bit. TBD]

### 2020-10-18 21:18

just now I was listening to @[abe-now](2020-10-10 p1), and at around 41:00, there is a letter sent about a woman's 11yo daughter that has anxiety around following the rules. she feels good to me, and I was quite distracted by the feelings that I was receiving. I had to take a break from the workshop cause I couldn't concentrate. I'm back now and I decided I wanted to invite her to join if she wants to :)

### 2020-10-24 23:47

I was watching robert's latest video on lucifer and fire symbolism (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/jf0woIGB25Q?t=498)) and he was talking about the yazidi culture. I didn't specifically feel any direct connection to anyone that I saw in any of the photos in that video, but I did keep thinking to myself that it would be really cool to have some yazidi girls joining in too.

I don't really know what more to say, other than that. I'm just sort of putting it out there so that LOA can take it from there.

### 2020-10-31 23:05

yesterday matt posted another video with some card tricks in it, and I didn't think much about it, however later when I was up on the field, it sort of became obvious that I wanted to invite diana (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BbnbfKbgf5Q?t=575)) to join in if she wants. pretty unexpected, but I like it :)

### 2020-11-02 21:36

just now watching @[abe-now](2020-10-24), I could feel very strongly the first girl (the 13 year old daughter) that was in the hospital, and I wanted to invite her to join if she wants to. she feels very good.

then, just now I was ... it was weird because I felt something when abraham said:

> "by speaking what you want, calibrating to what you want, letting them witness you doing the work. when you feel negative emotion, own it -- even say it out loud and do something about it -- and let them witness you using your guidance system on purpose, and then thriving in the exact way that you want"

and then when I was thinking about it, it felt strongly to me that I want to invite the other girl that was mentioned in the end as well: the one which esther met at "random" on the street with her mother and they shared a moment together enjoying each other so much.

that makes me wonder, because it seems like there was a connection between that quote above and the sudden realisation that I wanted to invite her as well... I guess, if one day I meet her, I'll ask her :)

### 2020-11-03 09:48

I want to make sure and invite the daughters of robert grant and muhammad ibraheem just in case they want to join. yesterday I felt some confusion on the subject, but last night I feel like it's ok to invite them if they want to join, as well.

### 2020-11-04 16:58

yesterday (11-03) and the day before (11-02) I wanted to see a jack-o-lantern on the porch of one of the apartments I walk through on the way to the fiold. the first time I heard some sort of scream (not a bad scream) from a girl. I wasn't sure if it was a girl that was signalling that she wanted to join, but it happened again yesterday, and I'm fairly certain that it was. anyway, I want to extend the invite to her if she wants to join. I really like the way she feels. can't wait to meet her :)

### 2020-11-04 21:37

earlier I was put to sleep and I had a weird dream. there was a guy that was telling me some things but I couldn't hear him. I became aware of a girl in the background somewhere, and then I can't remember exatly what was next but I said something like, "ovbiously we're talking about shuffling the deck of cards" or something like that (my response even surprised me too, because I said something like "obviously we're talking about", when I couldn't even hear what the guy was saying). I looked at the girl, and she was looking at me and there was like this implied question if she could join, and I was thinking in my head yes, but before I could say it, she gets very excited. I went to hug her and tell her "see you soon", when a bunch of other, people in the room freak out and say something like "not until after the graduation"[^1][^2]

I high-five the guy, and she runs off. as she's running off, I can feel her thinking about it, and it feels very strongly to me, and when that happens, I start to like float upward and begin to fly a bit. I say that to the guy because I can feel she is very happy, so I go to high-five him again but I can barely see him, and when he awkwardly high-fives me back, I realise I'm kinda standing like to the side and behind him a bit. it was like a weird angle (I couldn't really see him). anyway, I woke up kind of concerned because I didn't know what to think about feeling the girl's excitement allowing me to fly. I don't really want to rely on them for that capability. no matter the case, I thought I would write it out here even though I said yes already in the dream state.

there seems something really weird about this dream. I can't quite figure out what it is, and did it have any relation to the one I wrote out previously @[a-list](2020-11-04 16:58)? my initial thought on it is that it may be the same girl. if it is, then I suspect that the dream was designed to get her to feel strongly in a controlled environment so that they could neutralise her feeling in my perception, because I could feel the girl in the previous entry really well before the dream, and then after waking up I can't feel her anymore, or the one in the dream either.

I guess it's for the best, because after-all I my desire is to figure out how to do all that stuff from my own focus, and not having the girls as the condition to why I can do stuff like fly. I want to get it for myself. I want the girls too, but I really like the idea of accomplishing it for myself.

[1]: I this is what I found very weird, because I don't know what the invisible people in the room are talking about. if graduation were what I call "getting connected", this is a very strange thing because in other dreams, it's made very clear to me that this *won't* be happening, and I sort of just accept it and wake up and do my own thing, kinda like "yeah ok mom, whatever".

[2]: another weird thing about this, is that I don't know what they know. this sort of implies that if I were to hug a girl they feel like they would loose control of me, *in a dream*! I was aware that it was a dream which is why I wanted to say, "see you soon", but ever more than that, how do they suppose that I'm so close. it just didn't make much sense to me at all. maybe I'm closer than I think I am. my own desire to get this for myself means that nothing would have happened, so likely this is a manifestation of their fear -- even though my desire to get it for myself *is* still stronger than their fear... whatever... I don't care anymore, and I was even thinking that maybe I want to optimise for them to continue to reset me back. it will be the most beneficial for all.

### 2020-11-05 16:02

yesterday I mentioned a lost cat on a sign that I had seen near belvista in @[noseblog](2020-11-04 08:02), and I didn't think much about it. anyway, earlier today I was walking back and I looked at the sign and I was thinking about what I said when I began to feel something when I noticed her email: brittany.m.campbell@gmail. I didn't get it at first but now I want to invite her to join if the wants to :)

### 2020-11-05 16:07

I'm also reminded of a sign that I saw the day it snowed (day before?), on the corner of nottingham and troy for a yard sale. I remeber the street was a street I had never haerd of ... something 158? I really can't remember the street, but it doesn't matter. the yard sale sign had stars drawn on it, and that's what made me think that it was perhaps a message. anyway, I want to invite her to join in too if she wants to :)

### 2020-11-05 16:11

finally, I have been putting this off for quite some time now, but I want to remember that there were two older girls at the apartment complex that attracted my attention a few times. one has a white fluffy dog and the other I described as "bouncy". I said I want to remember them so they don't get lost in the shuffle, cause there were definitely times when I liked the way they felt, but then at other times it feels confusing and unsure. I want to decide on these in a future date because I feel there is resistance and stuff, that I don't want to give a definitive right now and to figure it out later when I'm more clear headed.


### 2020-11-09 23:55

this is kind of a lengthy one because for some reason I've been putting it off for a while. I wrote it on the 9th but then wasn't satisfied with it, so I held it off, but now I feel ok about it, so I'm just going to put it here.

there is a woman that I used to see often riding her bike. one day recently I saw her again. she looked more attractive to me than previously and I didn't think anything of it, but then later I was watching stars and I began to realise that perhaps one of her other daughters wants to join as well. I want to make sure that any of her daughters that want to join are invited.

next, the night before last, before I wrote @[noseblog](2020-11-08 01:02), I was walking out to the field as I was talking to myself when I heard a girl make a scream sound around bristol. at first I wasn't sure what it was all about, but I want to make sure she's invited to join if she wants to.

this one is from a while ago, but in @[youtube](https://youtu.be/jf0woIGB25Q?t=1213), I kept getting reminded that I could feel something there. however, there are so many different girls in that scene playing with the bubbles, I can't really figure out which one it could be. it's more than likely more than one, but my sensitivity isn't *that* good... I think it's best because I don't really feel anything negative around it to invite all of them in that section there. there are quite a few. just for posterity, I will enumerate the ones I see and any of them that want to, may join if they wish:

- 20:21
  - pink jacket
  - pink dress
  - white shirt/dress
- 20:25
  - bright pink and red
  - pink shirt & blue jeans
  - multi-coloured jacket
- 20:39
  - black shirt with flowers

this exercise made me feel somewhat uncomfortable. I'm sorry for the discomfort... it's done though though and I feel good about it. I hope everything works out ok here.

last night when I was listening to @[abe-now](2020-10-31 p1), there was a woman that sent in a letter talking about her 15yo daughter that self-harmed. I felt a little alarmed at this because previously when I heard those sorts of words, I began to feel the girl. however, in this case, I did not. I said thank goodness, because it was seemingly starting to become a pattern. however, last niht watching stars, I was thinking about another part in the episode when I had a strong negative reaction to the bit on a woman loving her son when I began to feel her. I think it's worth noting that it's really important to own how you feel and that no feeling in itself is "bad" -- and so I want to invite her to join as well if she wants to.

### 2020-11-11 23:57

I hope this one goes through... yesterday (I think -- can't remember), I was walking back downstairs and there was a girl on a netflix program that mom was watching with darker hair that I noticed. I remember it was right after I was writing about the not needing a manifestation, and I thought to myself something like, "well, if I remember her again on another day ... I'll invite her". something like that. I really can't remember it well. hopefully this is enough detail to figure out which one I'm talking about, but I was indeed just reminded of her, and so I want to invite her to join if she wants to, as well.

### 2020-11-16 19:51

yesterday (or the day before), jaron was watcting some movie that reminded me of max max meets entourage, and there was a little blonde girl in there that I later while star-watching realised that probably wants to join. I'd like to invite her to join in if she wants to.

also tonight, while listening to @[abe-now](2020-11-07 p2), the last question that was sent in, was from a 16 year old asking if we are really the "God" we've all been looking so hard to find. I really liked their explanation that we've been giving "God" the label of the creator of our reality, however, it's more like us that's the creator of our reality, so in that sense, we are "God". I really like owning that I'm the creator of my reality and that what I am experiencing is *is* a reflection of how I feel... that invigorates me so much. the only reason why I haven't brought this up is because I really dislike religious words, and so you will notice that I almost never mention "God" in relation to me, because of the limitations of that word (though I have mentioned YHVH). however, that is essentially the message I've been eluding to this whole time. you really can be anything that you want to be and you don't have to be limited by physical reality either. I am certain of this, and it's only our own limiting forms of perception which prevent us from realising this. anyway, I'd like to invite her to join in too if she wants.

### 2020-11-20 11:43

the night before last I had a dream and I don't remember the dream very well, but I think someone showed me a picture or something. somehow I became aware of this girl that it felt to me like I had seen many times previously in dreams, and she was anways around another girl I used to know in tuenti named laura rus. anyway, when I saw the image, I recognized the girl and I said to myself something like, "I really like her!!" and that was when I woke up. I thought about it for a bit after waking up, and I don't really know, but maybe it could be her sister or something. I'm not really sure. anyway, I want to invite her to join if she wants to.

next, last night I saw the latest video of daði freyr, @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WInX-gVHUPQ), and I felt something quite strong from the girl he was singing with (millie turner). it's really hard to explain anything of this, because I've only had strong sensations the whole time, and I can't really quantify them with words very easily. man does she feel pretty good. I want to make sure she's invited to join in if she wznts to, as well.

### 2020-11-24 23:30

I've been putting this off for a bit again, not for any other reason than I just didn't quite feel it. before I begin, I want to mention that I experienced a lot of "crosstalk" or maybe some coflicting energy on basically all of these. I feel good about them all, however. I really am not at all sure if the crosstalk is experienced on my end or if they had different thoughts going on in conflict to their desire or not (only really they know). that's one of the reasons I've waited so long too, to kind of let most of that settle down.

yesterday, I went to the dollar tree and I sort of put out the idea that I would be on the lookout for any that may want to join in. as I was looking at cards, I finally recognised a feeling, and I saw her, but there was some weird contradicting feelings. when I realised what was happening, she was walking away (or something like that). I really didn't want her to go away though and thankfully she came back. she had blonde hair, I believe (my memory is worse than ever). when she came back, she stood there and I was able to feel her pretty well. I want to invite her to join if she wants to.

there was also another girl that I got some different feelings from. she had black hair with either red of pink highlights (again my memory is really not working at all. I'm so sorry!) I wasn't sure of what I was feeling at first, cause there was like confusion or soomething, but I did feel like there was a solid good feeling a few times. I also want to invite her to join in if she wants to.

this morning when I was waking up, the first thing I remembered was the last time that I was at the dollar tree, there was a girl there, which I noticed, however I was feeling strong resistance as well. the feeling felt like I was trying to take or steal her or something like that. I didn't want to stir up any difficulty so I just sort of left it and didn't bother with it. I completely forgot about the whole thing until this morning when I noted that all of a sudden I wanted to extend the invite to her as well -- you know, just in case she'd like to join :) if she wants to join and it's not a problem, I'd like to invite her to join too.

lastly, when I was watching robert's video on the sons aryas @[youtube](https://youtu.be/TQdTfMnIzeM?t=332), I noticed this girl, and I kept remembering her. she's doing really great. I want to invite her to join in if she wants to, as well.

ok, been dragging my feet a little bit again on this one. before I begin, I have a sense of depression around the subject coming from other people. I suppose the idea is maybe perhaps that there are too many or something, but the thing is, the majority of what I feel are reactions from other people on the subject. I've learned that I cannot adjest how other people feel and I have to find a way to feel the best way that I can no matter the circumstances. I don't wish to make any predictions or anything, but if it feels bad to say no and it still feels good to say yes (dispite people's reactions), then I just go in the direction of what feels good. it's really that simple.

ok, here we go: first, two days ago I walked by jaron when he was watching facebook, and I saw a girl that was arond what appeared to be easter(?) type decorations or something. I had this weird thought that I should invite her, but I didn't plan on inviting anymore from jaron's facebook, because I could feel obvious discomfort from him because I often walk up to him while he's watching facebook and there's a girl there that feels like she may want to join, and I end up inviting her. it is a bit weird... anyway, I walked away and I could start to sense her even stronger. I was thinking, "are you sure" and it felt like I felt a strong yes-type response. this is the strongest impression I had, that it actually made me question if it was her or if it was nosebook. I guess I may find out in the future sometime. anyway, I want to invite her to join in if she wants to. I really hope it's a real girl, and not just nosebook trolling me. really, it felt, almost *too* tangible. weird...

next, I want to invite a girl from brien's video in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcBKA8abAWE) and @[youtube](https://youtu.be/9UXh5C-bGsE?t=77). she looks pretty happy and I could feel her also quite strongly yesterday morning. I don't know if I have very increased sensitivity or not, but it was like I was right with her and we were like running around or something. very vivid as well. hopefully she would like to join in. I really like her feeling.

this one was also really weird. I felt strangely attracted to view a documentary in in the documentary (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/K0ZUJtwXyY4?t=2817)) there is a girl called saiyana(?) that I started to be able to feel. the documentary was made quite some time ago, so I found that to be quite weird because most certainly she is much older by now and almost certainly different, so I doubted the feeling, yet it persisted, so yeah sounds good. if she wants to join, she's invited. how crazy is that man! so incredible!

I feel like I'm missing one. I'll update again shortly.

### 2020-11-28 23:19

yesterday, when I was watching @[abe-now](2020-11-14 p2), at the very beginning there was a woman that wrote in asking about her 9 year old daughter, and I was feeling her quite strongly. it's really weird when listening because I sort of enter into a weird trance-like state where all I can think about is the girl that they're talking about, and the experience is very tangible and quite vivid. it's almost as if I'm basically in the same room with her or something. it really is quite different. anyway, I was thinking about this because I would have thought that I would experince the "anger" part because that's what they were talking about but instead of feeling that, I could only feel the attraction. the funny thing about that is that they were explaining that you have to give your attention to what it is that feels good -- instead of the stuff that feels bad. good example. as they were talking I was realising that this is very important for me to start getting used to giving my attention to the stuff that feels good -- in general. anyway she got me thinking a lot about a lot of different things and I quite liked how she felt as well, so I want to invite her to join in if she wants to

### 2020-11-30 23:04

I will begin the creation box shortly (probably tomorrow), but I decided that I will write all of them here as well. there are quite a few that I haven't thought about in a while which have popped into my head recently, which I want to write down here. they're all going to go into the box and we'll see what happens there. I'll likely maintain the box and this document together, with their identification number as the date heading here. ok, here we go:

just tonight, mom was watching a show while I was having a conversation with her and there was a girl and a boy that were picking a lock in the show. I didn't think much about it, but I felt like there was perhaps some desire there and I wanted to invite her to join if she wants to.

additionally, at the start of the conversation with mom, we were talking about reality tv shows being scripted and stuff. I kept getting an example in my head of a dr. phil show with a girl that was acting out. I realised later that this was a mental trigger for me to remember a while back another dr. phil show[^1] where there was a girl that I invited to join. this whole thing I can't remember very well and has this strange haze to it, so when I remember more, I'll update.

there was another time when I was watching a show with thad called "goop" and when they showed gweneth's family in a photo, I could feel something there, and also this one is pretty hazy too[^2] -- doesn't matter though. if her daughter wants to join, she's invited :)

last night, I was watching a mathologer video, and then I wanted to click on another one of his videos[^3]. in the video he mentions his daughter laura, which I first noticed a feeling from her in another video about parabolas (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UapiTAxMXE)). I want to make sure she's invited to join if she wants to, as well.

[1]: I can remember one episode where there was a woman that was enabling her son to use drugs, a woman and a man which couldn't conceive, and another where there was a girl that was acting out and needed attention. I honestly have no idea which one it was, or if it even was one of these. I literally cannot remember any details here.

[2]: I don't really think my memory is really this bad. it's very weird how I cannot remember these things now.

[3]: the video is a good one (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSw3Wqoim5M)). he talked about how he obsessed over his kid's shoe tying, leading to a dream about it and some new maths proofs.

### 2020-12-07 00:58

yesterday, we went to the riverwalk, and there were so many different girls there that I felt attraction from, I cannot remember them all. I decided what I wanted to do is to simply acknowledge and invite them all. basically, if I looked at you, and you were feeling something, consider yourself invited. you know who you are :)

this one is a bit of a weird one, but I'm going with it... yesterday I watched lindsey's analysis on borat (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlqWBVea5S4)), and I didn't think much of it, other than.. there are definitely some similarities between that sort of humour and my own style... anyway, I was taking a shower today and it occurred to me that I should invite lindsey as well. the idea felt odd to me, but it didn't feel bad, so I'm going with it :)

last when I was upstairs earlier today talking to jaron, there was a girl on mom's TV with a red shirt or dress that I felt extremely attracted to. I have no idea much more than that. I don't know the show or any more than that. it was weird how strongly I kept feeling the attraction. it was like I knew exactly when to look at the TV, then every time I tried to look away, I kept wanting to look back. I honestly thought perhaps it was tampering or manipulation of some sort from nosebook, but it doesn't really matter I guess... up until now I've learned to trust my feeling, so if she wants to join in she's invited.

### 2020-12-20 02:34

I think this will be my last entry into this document (well, I'm not 100% sure on that). the reason is, I'm going to switch over to the "creation box" idea that they have been promoting. the last week or so, I've felt tremendous resistance to adding more to this -- however, I do not believe the resistance is my own. I'm 99% certain it originated from nosebook. I think that as I keep adding more here, they had to do stuff (make timelines?). I'm not totally sure what that was all about, but it doesn't matter.

the creation box is also kind of nice because I've been writing down a whole bunch of girls that I wouldn't have otherwise written down. it feels easier for me to just think of the box as "the vortex" -- and so I don't have to think of it as based in reality. this document feels more "real" to me. with the girls I've listed to put in the box, I don't restrict myself to this time/space reality, so it's easier in that way.

so why do it then? to feel the realness of "the vortex". everything that you focus on, becomes more and so what I like to feel is that those things are becoming more. we're entering into an age where we're going to begin to live "eternally" transferring our constciousnesses from body to body. therefore, the ones that I listed may be that way now, but they don't have to be. there's no restriction in that way, so I don't perceive that restriction. or, let's say in the proposed idea that I have where I will continue on to make a galaxy, upon which time, I'll put my consciousness back in time to this body and self-sabotage myself. maybe some of the girls want to do that with me too -- who knows, and we'll crash and burn here and eventually "die" -- where we'll simply wake up where we left off making the galaxy. it's a huge amount of beneficial contrast and leaves nosebook with the whole world all to theirselves. we won't need to come back until they desire it -- though, I imagine that I/we'll run various identities here to constantly be coming to the realisation of things we don't want (so we can create the things we do want in our galaxy).

don't worry, after we've created something magnificent (like ancient egypt), we'll likely turn it over to the world class wrecking crew, to make even more contrast :)

in all of those situations all of us (including those girls) will obtain new bodies and will have tons of opportunities to create all sorts of fun/interesting realities. again, there's no restrictions, so I don't perceive any. it doesn't even matter for example that I have the exact time and reference to the youtube video for it to work. LOa knows exactly who/what I'm talking about, so it all works out. there's no need to try and micromanage everything. who do I trust more to make my reality: my own focus, or nosebook? know what I mean? so, like I said, probably the last one.

in @[abe-now](2020-12-05 p2), at the very end, I could feel something from the girl that wrote in about her grandmother in the assisted living facility. I could also feel something too with the woman that wrote in at the very end about her twins. the daughter I could feel as well. I would like to invite them both to join in, if they want to.

### 2020-12-21 14:06

I also would like to invite anistyn @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN4VAI7UG-s). I got a comment reply from her mom to one of doug's videos and I wanted to look at her profile. I went there and upon seeing her videos list she had many of anistyn. the initial idea that popped into my head was to invite anistyn. I wrote it down for the creation box, however since then various events have happened, so I would like to invite aubrey as well. both of them are welcome to join in if they want to.

this morning while walking home from the field, I was looking at the trash nearby to the bridge there and I was attracted to a fuscia jacket laying in the trash and a pink towely shirt thing to the side. I didn't understand the shirt thing, but after I picked up the jacket, I could feel something from a girl. I'm assuming it was the previous owner. I would like to invite her to join in too if she wants to.

### 2020-12-21 22:57

today, a nice video appeared on my youtube feed from julia, which I quite enjoyed: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOZnI0v87RA). I gave a few of her videos a watch to remind myself of her, and I like the way she feels. I would like to invite her to join in too if she wants to.

I wrote these next ones in the creation box, but it seems that the creation box isn't as favoured as this document is. I'm going to begin the process of getting all of the ones in here also into the creation box, just cause I like the way it feels to focus on them, and then put it in there and then "give up on it" -- that is, give up on the effort to it manifesting and just let it sprout. I sort of like to see it sort of like a seed. the box is like putting it into the ground. once it's there, I don't need to worry awout the individual seeds. I only need to worry about the environment being conducive to their growth (water, right time of year, etc.) -- and then they just grow all by theirselves.

a while back, I watched the eurovision song contest movie, but I couldn't get very much further than only a half-hour in or so. it was too cringe for me. I turned it off, but I had some reactions that there was a girl in the movie that wanted to join in. I would feel her and she felt to me older -- like maybe even in her teens. anyway, I was finally convinced to watch the movie again, and after I did I was wondering who it was that I was feeling from the film, when it finally dawned on me that the reason I didn't recognise her was because I was looking for an older girl. turns out it was the girl in the very beginning of the movie: young sigrit. I was really quite amazed because she was so decided and conscious that I didn't expect that from such a young girl. I really want to invite her to join if she wants to :)

finally, I watched a while ago another song by daði freyr: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COj9SJAiO-w), and I didn't really know exactly what to do because I could feel all sorts of different things in that video. there were a lot of different people. it looks like the girl that shows up in first scene is in a few scenes, but I think the rest of them only appear once. it's really hard for me to tell. anyway. I didn't notice any bad feelings at all, so really anyone of them that wants to join is certainly invited.

### 2020-11-24 21:49

tonight we went down to the riverwalk. I was in a totally different zone. I don't really understand what is going on because once again I feel quite dead again, and everything is dull. however, after leaving the car, when crossing the bridge, I noticed that there was attention on me. at the time I wasn't thinking about any girls, so I didn't pay much attention to anything that was happening there.

later, there was a girl that was wearing green which I noticed and stood out to me. it was weird like I could feel like she was trying to communciate with me, but I literally couldn't feel anything. it was as if I had to use some new ultra-sesitive detector that I had never felt before. from then on I kinda realised what was happening and started to try and get used to the new feeling, which has almost no feeling at all. very weird. I don't know how to describe it.

as I'm writing this I can remember another that was near the waterfall at the end there, but I can't remember if she was before or after the one in green.

following that, there was a girl in pink that was wearing a mask which I saw earlier but hadn't really gotten used to the new sensation (or lack thereof) which stood out quite quite a bit. at this point I was starting to get the hang of the new sensations.

lastly, when we made if finally back to the car, I was seeing a girl in blue(?) walking up on the bridge as we were getting in the car, and I had this sensation that she thought she missed her opportunity.. don't worry, I could feel her clearly now.

so, I'd like to invite any of those mentioned here to join in if they want to.

### 2020-12-26 22:28

two nights ago after I wrote the above, I was reminded after I wrote it that there was some even previous to that. I said I would write it and I wouldn't forget. I'm still getting used to this dullness. I really don't quite feel anything, and it's taking quite a bit of time to get used to it; I have to really try hard to feel anything.

anyway, I remembered a girl that was wearing a red flowered shirt and a grey sweater right before the waterfall. she was walking in front of us, and then passed off to the side. previous to that there were also two other girls which were younger. one was with a man (father?) that looked and smiled at me, and the other one I can't rmember any details. I still hadn't really figured it out quite yet.

if any of them would like to join in, I want to make sure they got invited as well.

man... I really don't like feeling this dull. please bear with my as I get used to it... I'll get used to it soon, don't worry.

### 2020-12-28 23:35

earlier today I went for a walk. upon reaching massari, I suddenly had the idea to go look at a house's light setup. as I was walking over there, I had a feeling like I was going to meet someone. I wont over, saw the lights, and they weren't what they looked like at a distance, so I headed home. walking toward the park I suddenly had the idea to walk through the park home. I then had a sensation that I should continue forward on the street, so I did. I then saw a guy and a girl walking toward me and we greeted eachother. anyway, I wasn't sure at first what that was all about, but I'm pretty sure she was the sensation I was feeling. anyway, I want to invite her to join in if she wants to as well. anyw, btw thanks for the practise :) I'm still getting used to it, but obviously I'm getting much much better... :)
