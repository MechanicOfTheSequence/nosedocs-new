ok, after a few computer restarts, I'm just going to do it here...

---

anyway, in the middle of all of that overwhemment, a guy came over to me and got me to talk to him about mushrooms for a bit, and he was kind of pushing me to sort of leave, claiming that I was creeping out the girls, and I didn't really mind because I had already collected quite a few mushrooms, but what I was interested in was continuing on learning how to feel with that positional awareness. just in the few minutes that I was there, I went from not being able to feel much more than a kind of "soup" of stuff, to being able to start to actually tune into different almost locations.

it was really hard because, I could feel some desire and I could feel some other bits almost of discomfort[^1], but how in the world would I be able to tell from where it was coming from, right? I can't just say, yes to all of them and to figure it out or something because I was overwhemed. I thought of that as a solution, but decided against it, and to instead settle down and try to isolate and locate the different feelings. it worked surprisingly well.

so the guy kind of shoes me away and I go to walk home and I decided (logically) that because I thought I couldn't really get a good read, then I would just consider the event to be some sort of practice. however, the feeling persisted that I should try and make an effort to come up with something. I decided that I would just go with the ones that I could remember, or that made an impression on me. those were a blonde girl in the middle area, and a red-haired one pretty close to the same position, too. there was also one that I was feeling far over to the left there. I first sensed her when I noticed them and decided to, instead of walking through their group, to go the long way around to the tree with the mushrooms. thing is, I didn't get to really locate or isolate her very well, and I don't know much about her, other than black, probably her hair.

I'm just not good enough at this yet. I want to be able to practice more, because with the increasing difficulty, I just wish I could ... I don't know what I want, but I did enjoy the practice, and I know that if I got a bit of a longer chance, then I could get really good at it.

- around a week ago, nearby to where I cross the swamp, there was a white car with a man and a woman inside of it. if felt like they were petitioning for their daughter(?). I didn't feel it very strongly, but I explained why I think that was above
- I also noted that the reason why there were 3 random pairs of pants that showed up on the sofa up on the hill, was that they belonged to 3 girls. again, I think the reason why I couldn't feel them very strongly was for the same reason I mentioned above.
- on friday, after identifying the three girls that I could remeber, I kept feeling a something more, and I really don't know why, but I feel very inclined to invite the daughter of the man that talked to me about the mushrooms to join as well, if she wants to.
- minutes before this, and the reason why I decided to write this in this moment is because I was watching mom watch a NCIS episode, where there was a girls bike race that I thought was pretty hokey (hopefully I didn't think too many bad thoughts about it, lol), but I seemed pretty interested in the girl riding the bike[^4] and when I went upstairs to go get food, I felt very strongly that I should write this now and include her as well.

dang.

[1]: this is a weird thing, because it wasn't like bad vibes discomfort, but more like they were thinking that I was paying attention to what they were doing or analysing their performance or something. I wasn't. because of how weird things are with me and others watching theirselves through my eyes, I sense a lot of performance anxiety when I'm around people. it creates huge problems[^2], I try and pay as little attention to the exact movements, or sounds or whatever is being produced, and instead focus on the feeling. as long as I do that, which is hard, because sometimes, for example like with jon, I couldn't because he was complaining that he can't use his mind or something while I was listening to him talk. I was going to watch him and give him my undivided attention, but apparently that's too difficult, so I opted to just trying to listen in the background while doing something else -- but that didn't work either. so, I don't really know what to do about other people's discomfort, cept ignore isn't the right word, because I just focus on trying to feel the best feeling part from what is coming from them.

[2]: for example, it's hard to watch streamers because all I have is the ability to see them on the screen or hear their voice (I'm not in the same room as them, so their feeling is much harder to pick up[^3]), so I tend to hyper analyse their movements and their voice when they're streaming. this creates huge problems, like dani, jon, kripp, or thijs. the only one I really felt comfortable with watching was turbo knight, because I could focus on how the music sounded.

[3]: anyone who's learned another language would know what I'm talking about here when I say that it's easier to understand talking to someone in a language you don't understand very well, in person, and things like phone or skype conversations are considerably more difficult because so much of the non-verbal communication is missing.

[4]: there were multiple girls riding bikes, I know. I honestly can't remember now what all was even happening. I remember one went back to save a girl, and jaron made the comment, "that's why you shouldn't save anyone" -- and I remember black and pink, but that's it. that's all I can remember now from the whole thing, and I just saw it maybe 40 minutes ago... I can remember the feeling though. man, physical senses/memory these days is getting pretty awful, I admit. it's not *REALLY* that bad, I assure you. it's just a phase I'm going through. it'll get better again.

real quick ones here. first, a few days ago I was walking back from the field and I saw a woman that was about where the tire I had erected on the top of the hill. I would like to invite her daughter to join if she wants.

then on the 21st, I went to go get my blood taken and I was chatting with the blood taker. I didn't think much of it and I honestly either didn't notice that she mentioned her daughter, or it was deleted.. anyway, a few days(?) later I remembered her, and I would also like to invite her to join in, if she wants.

:)

yesterday I stumbled upon a great [youtuber named tina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxq9PsBVarBK9BpG9SYQF7w) and I seemed to be able to feel her quite strongly. I also really like her interests... she's totally invited if she wants to join in.

this morning when I was walking back to the house, I was putting my coat in my backpack and a noticed a girl getting in a truck. I wasn't quite sure I felt it well enough, but as time has passed now, I feel more sure about it. she's also wecome to join in too if she wants. :)

man, what a weird day, btw... :)

a few days ago I was out on the field and I was in a dream when a girl showed up (I think she had blonde hair) and she presented me with the idea that she wanted to join, saying, "I can translate russian and roman for you" (or something like that). I was so startled that I didn't know what to think. a weird thing popped into my head where I was reminded that I can't say no to girls or something like that which caught me off-guard even more, so I decided to feel her to know that way instead and I liked the way she felt. I went to turn around and look for her but I couldn't find her; she had vanished but I could still feel her. I woke up (or maybe someone else woke me up) and I rememberd it so that I would write it down. it took me a few times to remember, but I didn't forget :) anyway, I'm assuming she's real cause of nosebook's response. that's pretty amazing! she's definitely invited to join if she wants to.
today while picking mushrooms in the park, there was a couple(?) that got out of a truck in the parking lot, and I didn't think much of it. however, when I got home I could feel some reactions to it and also feel her as well. anyway, I can feel her strongly, so, I concluded that if that was a thing, I'm want to extend the invite to her if she wants to join.

### 2020-10-02 19:35

just went down to the park with jaron cause I wanted to see the mushrooms. they weren't grown yet, but I felt like asking jaron if he wanted to stay a little while longer. there was a man and a girl in a purple shirt that walked by and greeted us. I didn't really get it at first[^1] -- not sure why it wasn't super obvious right away, but I got the message :) I'd like to make sure and extend an invite to her if she'd like to join.

[1]: was she was feeling shy? because I mean I did all of a sudden just want to go to the park, so she did attract it, which is quite notable in itself :)

### 2020-10-03 20:40

earlier today I went down to get some mushrooms because I came home early last night and slept here. along the way I could hear some girls screaming (not like screaming in pain or something, but more like to get my attention) around near to where carefree #3 house would be. I don't really have much go work with because I could only hear them and they seemed persistent enough that it was something that they wanted. I want to extend the invite to them as well, so they're welcome to join in too if they want.

### 2020-10-06 11:40

today walking back from the park there was a girl running along masari that I passed while I was singing DARE (by gorillaz). I didn't think much about it when it happened, but then when I got home I started feeling reactions. if she'd like to join in, I'd like to extend the invite to her as well :)

### 2020-10-12 16:13

a few days ago, I was reminded of a youtuber that I unsubscribed from, and it felt like I was feeling strong desire  from her. I decided to feel her out when I was out on the field and I really liked what I felt. it seemed to me unmistakeable that I should extend the invite to her as well. I went home and looked at her channel though and tried to watch some videos, but seeing the videos, I realised quickly that she felt, in reality, nothing like how I had felt her on the field. the problem for me here is do I follow my feelings, or not? my feelings have never been wrong, up until this point, and I've said on numerous occasions that I trust them more than my physical senses at this point, so this example puzzled me -- a lot. I have to just go on the faith that what I was feeling is some sort of echo of the future (pun intended), and that we'll just have to see how it turns out over time.

I thought to myself that actually this may be the case with some of the other girls as well, and I feel/felt them as different than they are in their now present reality (this has been carrying on for quite a while, I admit). I kind of like the challenge actually, because I can still get back there and remember what any of them originally felt like to me. I developed this capacity in relation to my programming, because I would have an idea, and before 24h had passed, nosebook would have pooped on it and it no longer felt like it originally did for me, so I had to constantly go back and find the original feeling and work from there. it's not hard for me, and I do feel her desire strong enough still that I think I do want to extend the invite to [echo gillette](https://www.youtube.com/c/EchoGillette) as well.

next, yesterday I was watching, matt parker's SNN (spreadsheet news network) bit on youtube and he gave a shout out to seth meyers and referenced the yu tbe clip. he got the timestamp completely wrong in the link, so I ended up watching the majority of the video. I was looking forward in the thumbnail preview of the videos when I saw what appeared to be family pictures or something (he was thanking people cause it was his last in-home taping) and upon seeing some of the photos, I felt some sort of attraction and closed the video immediately. however, the event has been "plaguing" me (showing up repeatedly, sometimes multiple times a day) for quite some time now. I honestly don't know what to make of it, and I feel resistance to going back to the video to try and figure out what it was that I was feeling so I'm not going to. I don't feel bad about whatever it is, so I guess, it's a yes, and I suppose I'll find out whatever that was about later on when things finally develop further. I do feel good about it though, so really kinda a weird experience.

last, when I was watching @[abe-now](2020-10-03 p2) video, at about the 39m mark a woman with 5 children writes in, and honestly I don't remember much of what the conversation was about, because I kept feeling strong desire from one of her daughters. I could feel one strongly, and perhaps there was a second one as well, but I'm not sure -- as you know nosebook is very good now at making sure I don't feel the physical sensation of those emotions anymore. I slept on it, and I feel good about it when I woke up, so I do want to make sure that the one I could feel strongly is invited.
