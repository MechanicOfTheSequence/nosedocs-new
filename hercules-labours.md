Hercules and the initiatory way

The story of this old Son of God is the metaphor of the trials on the initiatory Path. Hercules is whoever fights problems in life and faces courageously the tasks of his destiny, undergoing pains and distress. Man's life advances in the Great Wheel of the Zodiac, which is the true path. By reading the story of this hero we will know the obstacles. Hercules, in actual fact, represents the incarnated man and the twelve labors that he faces represent the difficulties to free the spiritual element from the chains of materiality. The Pilgrim, therefore, is the ‘not yet perfect Son of God' that takes charge of his destiny in order to subject the lower nature to his divine descent

The oracle orders: Man, know thyself. For that Pilgrim, the higher achievement is to recognize his own divine identity.

The Mount of Transfiguration

The probationary path is the point of the evolutionary path where we face a deep self-conscience whose roots take nourishment from the divine will.

To win the impulses of the lower nature means to accelerate the process of transmutation, letting the flower of the soul opening faster. This can be obtained in two ways.

Through natural growth, where several life cycles are necessary to develop inner potentialities; or we can accelerate the process through a systematic and disciplined will, able to awaken the conscience of the soul in a very short time.

In this case the will becomes the “psychic solvent that eliminates all the waste” acting as a process of refinement, sublimation and inner transmutation.

The forces of human mysteries are reflections of spiritual energy whose powers, putting us in touch with universal powers, are the only means to learn the divine proposition.

In this way the initiate relates to the big ‘cloud of thought' made by Thrones and Principalities and he can become a co-operator of the evolutionary plane through which Life can guide its creation. This is the aim of Hercules and of every advanced member of the humankind.

Hercules is not only a representation of the strength and will of man. He is the man who crosses the signs of the zodiac and absorbs their faculties, he acquires the gift that they can give him and he is able, eventually, to express their characteristics. This allowed this man to know himself and to rule the forces of his destiny; stars can't control these forces but they can affect them by offering a vision of wider realizations.


Esoterical astrology

An oriental Master wrote: “… it is true that astrology is a science that in its future, in its highest aspect and in its true interpretation will make man able to focus understanding and to work properly. It will provide the secret of the true co-ordination between soul and manifested form. This astrology, though, hasn't been discovered yet…”

Astrology as we know it regards horoscopes concentrated on personal interests and little individual business. We know very little about the astrology based on the horoscope of the soul.

Esoterical astrology is not based on mathematical calculations neither it follows the laws of time and space, which don't have any effect on the soul. It interprets the interactions between the twelve types of cosmic energies and the human essence, moving it towards the five major Initiations.


The trials

The labors of Hercules make the ascending path of initiation. It is a path that ‘spins' in the Zodiac. Therefore the zodiac is not the ‘wheel' but the path ‘spins' in it. The first trial to overcome is fear, getting rid of the dread that stops us at our lower nature. This is what Hercules fights against before entering the sign of the Capricorn; he has learnt that the animal (individualism of lower nature) must be sacrificed at the fire of intelligence.

The trials, then, are an initiatory journey that produces the definitive change in human nature, through many little inner changes.

Aries (21 st March-20 th April) by capturing the man-eating mares , Hercules reacts instinctively but he learns the control of the mind. The journey towards the change starts from an indistinct spiritual push expressed as a sense of justice that leads him to save the others.

Taurus (21 st April-20 th May) Hercules captures the Cretan bull ; in other words he learns that desire must become genuine aspiration by dominating sexual energy. This energy must not be repressed but addressed to the right goal. The sexual spur and the power of attraction are the fundaments of the big illusion but, eventually, energy itself causes illumination.

Gemini (21 st May-20 th June) Hercules, by picking the golden apples of knowledge , knows himself. He subdues the three aspects of the lower nature: the physical body, desire and reason. The progress was so far subjective and characterized by desire; it now starts turning into mental power.

Cancer (21 st June-20 th July) Hercules' capture of the running Diana, a sensitive hind difficult to find, symbolizes the participation of shifty intuition, which is a higher intellectual faculty. In the previous cycles experience has turned instinct into intellect; now the initiate must turn the intellect into intuitive faculty where all the lower powers must be developed and sublimed.

Leo (22 nd July- 21 st August) Hercules kills the Nemean Lion . Through this trial Hercules shows Eurystheus, the master observing him, that he's able to kill personality even when it is characterized by the courage of the sign. In a real sense, the initiate demonstrates he's able to subordinate to the superior will even the most courageous lower nature, such as the one symbolized by the lion. He gives the warranty of the strength of his proposition.

The first five labors of Hercules complete the so-called Probationary Path. The killing of the Nemean Lion represents its acme.

Virgo (22 nd August-21 st September) Hercules accomplishes his sixth labor by obtaining the girdle of Hippolyte, the Amazonian Queen. In Aries, at the beginning, Hercules started the probationary Path with a partial failure. The first labor of this new journey as well is ‘accomplished, but badly accomplished'. The morale for both is that it is easier to make mistakes at the beginning. Therefore the candidate must never lower his guard because there's always the danger of making mistakes. Sometimes virtues can become a problem and a high initiate can lose the Path as well. The failure, though, is only temporary. Although we have other chances, it is better to remember that there is always a consequence to a mistake. A delay in the cycles is always a great loss.

Libra (22 nd September-22 nd October) Hercules captures the boar , an impulsive animal that represents the mobility of emotional mind. The capture of emotiveness by the force of will balances the couple of opposites and proofs that the inner balance is reached and we are ready to enter the next sign.

Scorpio (23 rd October-22 nd November) Hercules enters the supreme trial, which is supreme for the present humankind as well. The problem is to emancipate from illusion, to free oneself from the fog and the mental miasmas that hide reality behind the theatres of appearances. In this sign Hercules successfully overcomes the biggest trial by slaying the Lernaean Hydra . After demonstrating he's able to manage desire by re-establishing the balance in his mind, the direction of his mind is univocal because it's not held by appearance.

Sagittarius (23 rd November-22 nd Dicember) Hercules improves his one-way direction. Like in Aries he captured the man-eating mares and subdues them to his purposes, he now kills the Stymphalian Birds ending once for all the tendencies to use the thought in a destructive manner.

In Capricornus (23 rd December-20 th January) Hercules, with the killing of Cerberus, becomes an initiate, a semi-god, man and Son of God able to work in the Infernal regions, on Earth and in the Sky. In the symbolism of the three-headed dog is described the definitive transfiguration of the earthly personality. Transfiguration is in fact the first of the major Initiations.

Acquario (21 st January-19 th February) Hercules reroutes the river and cleans the Augean Stables. He puts the purifying water at service of man. The water of understanding purifies the heart of the initiate. This is the meaning of the sign of Aquarius, which we entered a few years ago. It is symbolized by a Man who carries a jug of water on his shoulders. This is the symbol of the servants of humankind; for mystics it is also the symbol of the Savior of the world.

Pisces (20 th February-20 th March) Hercules captures the Red Cattle , put them in a golden bowl and skin them in the Temple. Such is the beauty of the sign in which man becomes the savior of the world by transcending and redeeming the animal essence in humankind.

On the path of self-conscience the character and the nature of Hercules are put to the test, until the qualities that characterize his materiality are transmuted and reveal the soul. This turns him into a semi-god, like any other initiate.

This consciousness is the realization of the Path that Hercules reaches with will power and intelligence, accepting that suffering is the biggest purifying force.

Following the deeds of Hercules, the trials on the Path of the zodiac of the initiate can be resumed in the duty to learn altruism by subduing the impulses of the corporal nature. Pain originates from the competition between altruism of the soul and avidity of material conscience. Balance, at last, originates from the victory on lower pushes that make the initiate able to sacrifice himself for the common wellbeing, through an intelligent use of his will. This makes him a good servant and a source of inexhaustible creativity.

These are the lessons left by the myth of Hercules.

“The help comes from a source beyond our limited existence but it is not outside us. It doesn't understand our limits therefore it is not in synchrony with us. The source of help, though, shares our heart and a current of compassion joins us. The current is inside us, not outside. Otherwise the source won't be able to understand us. This means being without being, being inside and still being outside, being finite but serve the infinite” D.T. Suzuki .

The Three cosmic Crosses

The subject of Crosses is too big to be exhausted in a note. The cross in the circle is one of the oldest symbols in humankind. It was originally formed by the crossing of the twelve zodiac signs, forming 36 crosses, because every sign is divided into 3 decades called ‘the 36 crossed stars'. The Zodiac is made of 360 degrees, the square of 90 degrees is a quarter of the circle that will form the four corners of the cross in the circle. At last, the Three cosmic Crosses represent the three aspects of spirit, soul and body.

The Mobile Cross includes these four constellations:
The meaning of Gemini is the swap between superior and inferior mind.
The meaning of Virgo is the physical form that feeds the celestial child representing the incarnated soul.
The meaning of Sagittarius is the aspirant proceeding towards the goal.
The meaning of Pisces is death and consumption, the sacrifice of self given by the Savior of the world.
This is the cross of daily life which men are all subjected to. The crucifixion to the material trouble represented by the ‘nails of the four physical elements' (earth, water, air and fire) symbolizes incarnation and birth, development and death of the physical body. In an initiatory sense the mobile cross marks the instability characterizing the aspirant, still unsure of his decisions.

The Fixed Cross includes these four constellations:
The meaning of Taurus is illumination, the mind conscious of its abstract (aerial) condition and of the presence of the soul.
The meaning of Leo is self-conscious individuality.
The meaning of Scorpio is freedom from illusion.
The meaning of Aquarius is to be a servant of humankind, giving away the water of understanding that purifies mind and physical conscience.
In an initiatory sense the fixed cross expresses the initiate steady in his decision taken after the choice of starting the way of inner transformation.

The prophet Ezekiel represented Aquarius with a human face, Leo with a lion's head, Taurus with a bull's head and Scorpio with an eagle's body.
The four animals of the Revelation symbolize the four Evangelists.

The Cardinal Cross includes these four constellations:
The meaning of Aries is Creation, or the start of the individual work.
The meaning of Cancer is to be the first door of incarnation.
The meaning of Libra is the balance between life and form.
The meaning of Capricorn is the door to the spiritual life.

This is the cross of the spirit of the initiate when he meets the inner inhabitant that will totally enlighten his conscience. The light of will of the inner God (the so-called Lost Word) is expressed through the mind and the body of the initiate; the latter will turn from quiet witness into instrument in the material world, called by mystics ‘incarnation of the Word'.
Therefore the initiatory meaning of the cardinal cross is the same of the initiate now steady ‘in the light' of the unveiled spirituality.
