### typhon's similarity to vulcan

there is a similar story in the hesiod which matches both the description of a king of gods and men, and also of someone being thrown out and becoming lame, in the story of typhoeus (line 820). there are some interesting elements to this story which may elude to the identity of typhoeus perhaps being vulcan:

1. typhoeus is the product of earth (gaia), venus, and tartarus (where saturn precides).
2. snakes, dragons, and a lot of fire in his eyes are associated with this typhoeus
3. voices came from these snake heads:
  - voices which the gods understand (man)
  - sound of a lion
  - noise of a bull
  - wonderful sounds of puppies (whelps/dogs)
  - hissing (of a snake?), so the mountains echoed
4. if this typhoeus were not defeated, "he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals"
5. typeous was hurled down, a maimed wreck
6. flames came from the strucken god in the mountain (volcano?)
7. a huge part of earth was scorched and melted like the melting of iron by the power of hephaestos

I find it interesting that the voices that this god made are the sounds of 3/4 of the cardinal points, (man, lion, and bull), and the final one is a wonderful sound coming from baby dogs (sirius?), and a hissing (snake?) which re-echoed(?) the high mountains. had zeus had of allowed this to happen, certainly he would have been a "king of gods and men".

as a result, this figure, which was a product of earth, venus, and saturn, was cast to earth, in the form of a volcano, and from the sound of the wording, makes it sound like it marked the beginning of the archeological iron age (the bronze age collapse):

> And flame shot forth from the thunder-stricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount, when he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapour and melted as tin melts when heated by men's art in channelled crucibles; or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is softened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of Hephaestus.

[820] But when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge Earth bare her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus, by the aid of golden Aphrodite. Strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew an hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of heart; and at anothers, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again, at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed. And truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men and gods been quick to perceive it. But he thundered hard and mightily: and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and the sea and Ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat. And through the two of them heat took hold on the dark-blue sea, through the thunder and lightning, and through the fire from the monster, and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt. The whole earth seethed, and sky and sea: and the long waves raged along the beaches round and about, at the rush of the deathless gods: and there arose an endless shaking. Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of the unending clamour and the fearful strife. So when Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, he leaped form Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. And flame shot forth from the thunder- stricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount,26 when he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapour and melted as tin melts when heated by men's art in channelled27 crucibles; or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is softened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of Hephaestus.28 Even so, then, the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire. And in the bitterness of his anger Zeus cast him into wide Tartarus.
