### hindu mythology

- Mercury - बुध (Budha)
- Venus - शुक्र (Śukra)
- Earth - पृथ्वी (Pṛthvī)
- Mars - मंगल (Maṅgala)
- Jupiter - बृहस्पति (Bṛhaspati)
- Saturn - शनि (Śani)
- Uranus - इन्द्र (Indra) and others say अरुण (Aruṇa)
- Neptune - वरुण (Varuṇa)
- Pluto - यम (Yama)

Indra is lord of a place called Devalokha (devas and humans co-exist here)

I'm wondering if अरुण (Aruṇa) may is a reference to the egyptian god ptah. the legend is that this prehistoric age, was before even the sun, was auric age, and this is "aru". perhaps the same as the sumerian primordial god "anu". the idea here is that uranus (and gaia) made the original gods, of which saturn became the next one, creating the titans (serpents), of which, zeus overthrew saturn and created the next gods (eagles)
