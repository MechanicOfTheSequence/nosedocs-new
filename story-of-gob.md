# story of gob

gob is an upright and righteous man because be belives that anything that you desire is provided for you be the universe. he percveives the wanted aspect of everything.

as a result, he lives a very bountiful life. however, even though he has everything he wants, he still desires more expansion (consider him greedy). the universe manifests his desire relatively quicly as a jealous individual who cannot stand to see gob propspering so much. the evil man begins to put curses on gob and his family causing causing calamity and destruction in his life. nearly all of his estate is destroyed and all of his possessions are taken from him. gob is distraught and tears his cloths off (he thinks better without clothes on).

now, even though gob is in tremendous turmoil, he does not reject the foundation of his previous prosperity, which is that he attracts everything into his experience -- even such a disaster as the present one. this infuriates the evil man further and and causes him to want to take even more things from him. the evil man curses him and his health, causing gob tremendous illness, pain, and disfiguration of his body. gob, however, still does not give up on the idea that he attracts everything into his experience. so, while his present circumstances are quite terrible, gob still prefers the feeling control that he has when believing that everything he is experienceing, he attracts.

of course, this angers the evil man even more, and thrown into a rage, he decides to curse gob with the "imperius curse" -- which is a curse that places gob entirely under the the evil man's control. the evil man has gob go around and complete the destruction of whatever's left over from his estate. after setting fire to his house, gob decides to kill himself. however, he cannot find a way to do it because gob does not believe that he can die to his own hand -- so, even if he were to hurl himself off of the top of the tallest cliff, he is certain that all he would have is an even more miserable time he's having now laying bloodied, and all of his bones broken at the bottom of the cliff. that is, until he finally attracts someone to recue him. the evil man cannot figure out how to influence gob to kill himself.

so, even though it appears that gob really does want to die, the evil man cannot figure out the imperious curse doesn't give him *complete* power over gob. frustrated that the most powerful curse does give him full control, the evil man decides that if he can't get him to kill himself, he will personally ensuring that gob does not get any assistance from anyone. over the course of the next 10 years, the evil man sees to it that gob lives as miserable of a life as possible. many good good samaitans came by attempging to assist gob, but the evil man curses them and drives them all away. gob continues to perceive the wanted aspect in everything and even though he has someone dedicated to making his life miserable, his illness departs, and his body begins to appear more and more vibrant each year that passes.

as it turns out, making someone's life miserable isn't very enjoyable. enraged that all of the evil man's attempts to make gob's life as miseable as possible are not breaking his spirit, the evil man turns to take notice that other people are beginning to corroborate gob's perception and are beginning to prosper as well.

becoming more jealous and angry than ever before, the evil man departs from gob in attempt to find someone he can influence and join him in his misery.

in physics when you push against something, it must exert equal force in opposition to the original force. this is an apparant doubling of energy. in the physical world however we see these energies cancel each other out, however the the energy doesn'g go nowhere. both the impactor and the impactee generate double the enewgy on impact. the energy that gets canceled out, does leave the physical world, but it still exists in an environment without friction or inertia (the non-physical vacuum?), and it is possible to retrieve this energy and bring it back into the physical again. with physical components, this likely has to do with angles and harmonics which allow this energy batk into the physical easily, but for humans in our every day interactions, we do this with our perception. let's look at this mathematically:

*only three states are possible in this example: going toward wanted (1), going away from wanted (-1), and no movement at all (0)*

gob is going toward posperity so he's at a velocity of 1 toward wanted. his desire is for expansion attracts into his life a force which will *double* his present energetic value, which brings the evil man into the picture. the evil man applies a pressure in opposition to gob, in attempt to push him away from wanted (-1). a normal person does not have much strength to their perception (0), so when wanted things happen (1), they're at 1, and when unwanted things happen (-1), they find theirselves at -1. gob however has a strong perception, believing that he attracts his experience and because he looks for the wanted aspect in *all* things (even disaster), by nature when things are going well, he's going toward wanted (1) with his perception and the present moment is a wanted state (1). therefore he experiences a doubling (2). howeever, gob desired expansion, therefore he was not perceiving wanted, but the  the phys that things perceiving that unwanted things are happening will just go along with i

when the present state is wanted, the value 1.
when the present state is unwanted, the value is -1.
abaence of wanted nnd absence of unwanted are a value of 0.

when someone perceives wanted, it adds 1 to the value.
when someone perceives unwanted, it adds -1 to the value.
awareness of the absence of wanted or unwanted adds 0 to the value.

gob has a wanted state (1), and he desires (absence of wanted) an expansion. therefore the value is 1.
eg. wanted state (1) + absence of wanted perception (0)

the evil man appears and begins to turn gob's state from wanted (1) into unwanted (-1).

gob has a choice to perceive his new state as wanted (1) or unwanted (-1), and add the value to his state:
unwanted state (-1) + perception of absence of wanted (0) = -1
or
unwanted state (-1) + perception of wanted (1) = 0

therefore, if gob did not have a perveption that he attractes his experience (0), gob's value would go from 1 to -1. however the catastrophe causes gob to remember that he attracts everything into his experience, and therefore it is wanted, even if it doesn't appear that way.

after the evil man leaves and stops trying to force gob's life into unwanted, gob's life will go back to going the way of gob's perception, so the state will go from unwanted (-1) to wanted (1) again. additionally, with gob's new form of perception (that all things are attracted and therefore wanted), gob's new value will be: wanted state (1) + perception of wanted (1) = 2.

thanks to the evil man, gob has effectively doubled his attraction power. pretty good.

interestingly enough is the case of the evil man.

the evil man is jealous, so he's starting off un an unwanted state (-1), and then becausse he desires to drop gob down a notch, he is perceives the absence of unwanted (0). his value is therefore -1.

if we consider that the unwanted state (-1) creates desire for wanted (1). this means that we should now perceive the value as a composite of a physical and non-phyaical value as well. let's make a table:

| state | + | perception | = | (physical, non-physical) value |
| ----- | - | ---------- | - | ------------------------------ |
|  0    | + |  1         | = | (1, 0)                         |
|  0    | + | -1         | = | (-1, 1)                        |
|  0    | + |  0         | = | (0, 0)                         |
|  1    | + |  1         | = | (2, 0)                         |
|  1    | + | -1         | = | (0, 1)                         |
|  1    | + |  0         | = | (1, 0)                         |
| -1    | + |  1         | = | (0, 1)                         |
| -1    | + | -1         | = | (-2, 2)                        |
| -1    | + |  0         | = | (1, 1)                         |
