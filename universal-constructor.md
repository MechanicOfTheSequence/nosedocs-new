# constructor thory

I'm listening to this talk on constructor theory and to be quite honest, I understand very little of it. however, there are some observations that I have made which is helping me to put the pieces together

### it's not the machine

the language used like "constructor" and "machine" makes it seem like this theory is describing a machine. however, it's more to do with what reality is capable of, assuming that reality is a sort of machine. she describes it by saying it needs to be able to replicate itself, etc.

### what about simulation theory?

as she was talking, I couldn't help but to think that the major problem with simulation theory is that if it is a simulation, who is doing the simulation (god?) and if there is a simulator somewhere does it have finite computation capacity? given that we remove the idea of god from the theory, then the simulator must be modeled after nature itself, and be therefore synonymous with nature.

simulation theory needs an architecture like this to work properly without invoking a god or some higher consciousness entity running the simulation.

### how does this constructor explain consciousness?

my initial thoughts on this are kind of like combining simulation theory and constructor theory. imagine that it is a large machine (doesn't matter *where* it exists; just imagine it does, somewhere) and then imagine that we are essentially inside of the machine which is itself reality. this could be the origin of a lot of the different "we are god" motifs throughout history.

additionally, you would need some way to separate yourself from the simulation. it makes no sense that a constructor capawle of replicating itself would endlessly replicate itself only to make *one* simulation. given that self-replication is effortless, certainly there are countless (infinite) replica simulations with slightly different variables. this quickly becomes an optimisation problem for the machine now. the experience "you" are having would then just be one of countless replica simulations with slightly different parameters.

so then, who are you? you have to be some part (or aspect) of the constructor because you transcend the instanced "you" in the insividual simulations.

### what are the elementary materials that the constructor can use to replicate itself?

this question got me thinking. the wan asking the question made a point that I thought was quite illuminating to me. what I understood him say (which may not have been what he said) was that a computer operates on information, and space can be perceived also as information. he mentioned a sigularity which I don't know what that is, but the image that I was getting is that you could perceive that space itself may have a sort of DNA to it as well. it too is a whole bunch of bits of information interacting with other bits of information and -- just like how a 2d string of bits in DNA can fold into a 3d structure and then arrange molecules (space) into a larger 3d structure, so to must "space" be doing a similar thing.

it appears to me like these collections of information, whether they are a AGCT or a oxygen or a carbon or whatever, these are complex self-replicating bits of information.

previously, with the last question she gave an example that minds and natural selection are the only things that create this resulting "knowledge". this seems to be some thing that is stored outside of the physical constructors. when I think of natural selection, who can I say is the "species" or the respository of the knowledge of that species?

more specifically, going back to the simulation theory, imagine that there is a genetic algorithm that is performing survival of the fittest or some other kind of selection, this knowledge the selctor is using to make the selection comes from somewhere. you could say that the environment is the determinining factor for natural selection. I postulate that perhaps knowledge is an emergent property of the combination of environment and such, such that the knowledge or the the constructor is given to the participants in the simulation so that they too would become constructors as well.

would not the most adaptive constructor have the highest likelihood of survivability and produce most competent repicas? constructors would just be designing better and better constructors, right?

ok, after relistening, I didn't hear what he said... he (actually) said that space is a bunch of *locations and trajectories* that information can take. a very interesting idea. again I don't I heard what he said because I just relistened again and what I heard (or what appeared(?) in head) was a concept that space emerges as a tangible thing based on rate of change very much like sound. for example, mix a note and its octave above, and it appears as two things in the same "space" yet it's still one signal. the reason why it does this is if you look at the trajectory of the signal (the speed at which it's moving from one limit to another (eg. +1,-1)), if this change is slower we say it's low frequency, and if it's faster we say it's higher frequency.

now picture the two octave notes at the same time. we can divide the full-wave of the first note from the standard 4 quadrants now into 8 parts. we see in the first part, because we add the two notes together and the second one is double the frequency, the rate at which it climbs (its trajectory) is 3 (not sure about this...) times faster than just the first note. it appears to be accelerating more rapidly towards its limit.

I don't know how to say this in physics language :(

### replicate knowledge or conceive something new?
