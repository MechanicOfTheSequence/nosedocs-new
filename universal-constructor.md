# constructor thory

I'm listening to this talk on constructor theory and to be quite honest, I understand very little of it. however, there are some observations that I have made which is helping me to put the pieces together

### it's not the machine

the language used like "constructor" and "machine" makes it seem like this theory is describing a machine. however, it's more to do with what reality is capable of, assuming that reality is a sort of machine. she describes it by saying it needs to be able to replicate itself, etc.

### what about simulation theory?

as she was talking, I couldn't help but to think that the major problem with simulation theory is that if it is a simulation, who is doing the simulation (god?) and if there is a simulator somewhere does it have finite computation capacity? given that we remove the idea of god from the theory, then the simulator must be modeled after nature itself, and be therefore synonymous with nature.

simulation theory needs an architecture like this to work properly without invoking a god or some higher consciousness entity running the simulation.

### how does this constructor explain consciousness?

my initial thoughts on this are kind of like combining simulation theory and constructor theory. imagine that it is a large machine (doesn't matter *where* it exists; just imagine it does, somewhere) and then imagine that we are essentially inside of the machine which is itself reality. this could be the origin of a lot of the different "we are god" motifs throughout history.

additionally, you would need some way to separate yourself from the simulation. it makes no sense that a constructor capawle of replicating itself would endlessly replicate itself only to make *one* simulation. given that self-replication is effortless, certainly there are countless (infinite) replica simulations with slightly different variables. this quickly becomes an optimisation problem for the machine now. the experience "you" are having would then just be one of countless replica simulations with slightly different parameters.

so then, who are you? you have to be some part (or aspect) of the constructor because you transcend the instanced "you" in the insividual simulations.
