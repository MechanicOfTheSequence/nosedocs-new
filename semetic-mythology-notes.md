humans have 24 ribs. apes have 24 pairs of chromosomes. the "gods" likely had 23 pairs of chromosomes, so if you were to take a "rib" out of adam (ape) to make eve, then the resulting form would be a creation made in the image of the gods, having also 23 pairs of chromosomes.

I think this is the most likely explanation of this subject.

#### the tree of knowledge (of good and evil)

this story is a weird mix of elements. the tree part is a mix of symbols. it has a serpent in the middle and on the left you have the masculine planet enki, and on the right you have the (IMO) feminine side of anu. I believe that anu is pictured in masculine form mostly, but it has a crescent shape (obvious female symbol).

#### cain and able

at the core, this is a conflict between shepherd and farmer. in sumerian mythology, dumuzid is the shepherd, and enlil is patdon of agriculture. dumuzid/tammuz is also a reborn deity which also associates him with saturn.

there's another weird thing that happens where saturian imagery begins to shift from saturn being associater with sheep herding, and then begins to have agriculture symbolism including the "reaper's sythe" (you reap what you sow). there's

this must be the new symbolism

#### ninurta as saturn

I do not find this to be so, at all. first major problem is that he is pictured with an eagle's head, and other times he's shown riding a beast with the body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion. clearly he was in power for the zodiacal quarter of scorpio to leo. clearly, this is jupiter. jupiter userped saturn's power in scorpio, which is why it has the combined serpent/eagle symbolism.

#### innana/ishtar

she is often seen standing on top of a lion. this is always symbolic of the zediacal sign this god was in power. I take this to mean that must have been when she was born from zeus. it kind of makes sense, because I postulate that the right side of the zodiac.
