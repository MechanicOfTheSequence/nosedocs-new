> Amenhotep III might have exerted a little power in private as well. Abraham & Sarah probably didn't have any children by each other, being too closely related. And the Torah doesn't say that they did â€” it says, "...the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. And Sarah conceived..."26,27 This could have been the Lord Amenhotep III giving Sarah a baby in the worldly way. Of course, royalty during this period liked to stir up the gene pool, while the acknowledged father was whoever raised the children, which in Isaac's case was certainly Abraham. And the Lord said to Abraham, "through Isaac shall your offspring be named."28 So Abraham was to treat Isaac like a son, including passing his titles to the boy. The Lord further stipulated that Abraham must send away his concubine Hagar, along with their son Ishmael,29,30 such that the Covenant would pass exclusively to Isaac. This would have displeased Abraham, who would have thought that when the Lord Amenhotep III said previously, "To your offspring I will give this land,"1 it would be to Abraham's very own son,31 not to Sarah's by the pharaoh himself. With the Covenant passing to Isaac, the grant would revert back to the pharaoh's family. That might have been the motivation for the Binding of Isaac.32

implying that the covenant (egyptian grant to abraham) will pass through isaac, which was amenhotep III's own son, given to sarah.
