# the revelation by kenny

this is a reinterpretation of the book of revelation. as I was listening to russ read chapter 13 of the [gods of eden](/docs/William_Bramley_-_The_Gods_of_Eden.pdf), I really began to think of it in a whole new light.

let's imagine for a moment that the custodial brotherhood does exist and that they do have ufos and time travel capabilitiy, they would have done a whole lot of modification on this timeline to affect things to create the future they desire to happen.

I propose that the germans aquired this technlogy from extrterrestrial entites and that tesla gave this techology to the americans before trancending space and time himself -- or perhaps he just "jumped to another body" -- or as I like to perceive it, he achieved a celestial identity status and man various "muns" or bodies in play which are extensions of his celetial identity. it's quite possible that one of those bodies is my own, and that the nature of the game is for the terrestrial identity (mun) to become conscious of his/her true (source) identity. in other words, my "future self" is just another version of the parent entity which has "self-sabotaged". inotherwords, we are a cascade of self-realising beings. the entire human race will accomplish this.

what I want to say about that is that the structure is a manifestation of the emotion (or perception), and therefore those which don't conform or harmonise with how that form (timeline) feels, can not continue to exist in that timeline. so imagine that both the nazis and the americans were given timeline technology and they are able to navigate timelines which are a harmonic with how they feel. they will perceive and navigate toward timelines (structures) which are harmonic with how they feel.

so what we will have seen is once the custodians got this technology, there will have been a whole lot of appearances of UFOs and things like that which have affected the physical conditions (like viruses and wars) to manipulate the timeline in the direction that they want it to go. the way the tecnology works is that you navigate toward the timeline that you perceive (physical conditions) which feel good to yeu within the structure of your perception. what that means is you shoot the arraw and then source paints the target around the arrow.

the book of relelation is a vision which john had which accurately makes possible the future the custodians are attracting. the future, as transmitted by them and interpreted by john will create the reality that they are desiring to manifest. this is their structure and those that are harmonic with their structure will experience a reality which feels harmonic to their structure. their structure is just one of many such structures that can possibly exist.

I will offer a second interpretation to the symbols presented, with my new understanding of who the great dragon is. in the "gods of eden" book, en'ki is the "prince of the earth" and his father anu is the king of the earth. on the world tree, enki is depicted on the right, which in ancient times is always the feminine side -- along with a crecent moon, which is also a female symbol as well. anu is on the left[^1].

tl;dr - saturn = enki = time = serpent = dragon
tl;dr - jupiter = thoth = physical = space = eagle

I have depicted the right (feminine) side's symbol as a cat. the left (masculine) side would be a dog. I also have recently come to understand the left is 3/7 rulership and the right is 1/5 rulership. or, inotherwords the left is physical conditions/sensations and the right is emotional conditions/sensations.

the sirians talk about saturn in lesson 9. saturn was a pterodactyl (eg. flying reptile or dragon) and was choosen by humans to be represented as satan. saturn is time (4th ray), and so what he enki/saturn did was to give humans the ability to navigate time (which is done with emotions). however emotions hadn't been very well developed yet, so most navigation of time was done with (3rd ray) structures.

the serpent is associated with saturn and enki and is the original symbol of the "brotherhood of the serpent". times were good when the serpent (saturn) was in power. jupiter (anu) is associated with space or physical and in the 3rd ray triad is thoth.

later, the sirians say that the 3rd ray triad departs and the 7th ray triad shows up which has hera (+7) with vulcan (-5) and zeus (-7). in this setup, anu's daughter, ishtar (venus, athena) is taking the form of a 7th ray female (+7), which is the opposite of what she normally is (+1)[^2].

so, what we see is an interesting transformation (like a step-down transformer), that the original two were time represented as saturn (promethus/enki, -4), and space represented as thoth (-7). they depart and then thoth is replaced with jupiter (-7) and saturn is replaced with vulcan, and the female swaps polarities as well, she goes from +3 to +7. you can see how symbolically (3), this shows the transformation of source (4) down to emotion (5) which is received in equally in the physical (7) as well as transmitted.

if you didn't follow the last bit, it doesn't matter, because it was the long way to tell you that I will be reinterpreting "satan" and the dragon as enki, saturn, prometheus, vulcan or jesus. also, in this interpretation, I will assume this is a vision transmitted by the custodians with time navigation (conceptual) technology have transmitted this vision to produce the desired (physical/spatial) reality that their technology is helping them to attract. because of this, I will interpret "God" as equal to the objective of the corrupt brotherhood or custodians (as rendered by bramley in the "gods of eden" book). I believe there is also talk of an anti-christ. I will interpret the "anti-christ" as someone who is not interested in saving anyone. somebody like me, who recognises that one's own salvation always comes from one's own efforts, and any "saviours" that promise "salvation" are just extensions of the custodial brotherhood.

finally, I want to explain that this interpretation is yet another structure. it contains symbols and predictions for the unfoldment of time which generate a feeling response in you. I want to explain that both this interpretation and the original "christian" ingerpretation of the same symbols.

like machiavelli proposes, you need to create two structures and have people fight between the two saying that their own interpretation of the structrue is the "right one", when all along, neither of the structures are the real thing that is planned to happen. both sides are "straw men" and are designed to fail. therefore, I offer this interpretation only as mental exercise to transform symbols. this concept is explored in page 116-119 in "gods of eden". this interpretation is the second structure which is designed to fail.

I would like to remind the reader that the structure (3) does not matter, because many realities are possible within the structure, but what really matters is not what the "prophecy" (structure, 3) says, but how you feel. the way you feel (and by extension your perception) is how you navigate "time" or your connection/alignment/harmony with your "source". none of this matters.

[1]: fire itself is the 4th chakra. fire is the heart or soul, and saturn is a 4th ray. emotions (3rd) are how it is navigated though. interestingly enough, I think it's important to actually look at this from the bottom up, and 1/physical = root, 2/imagination = regenrative, 3/emotional = solar plexus, 4/source = heart, 5/structure = throat, 6/relational/christ = 3rd eye, 7/desire = crown. so in order to navigate your source (fire), you use emotions.

[2]: 1st can be perceived as a 7th when looking in reverse. the best example of this would be andrea. she is a +1, but at the moment, she's playing the part of +7. 5th can also be perceived as 3rd when looking in reverse. 7th can also be 1st, and 3rd can also be 5th. desire can be manifest easily when 1 and 7 works together. time can manifest rapidly when 3 and 5 work together. they can make the reversal depending on where the rulership is placed in the consciousness. this seems to suggest that the 3rd ray triad (venus, saturn and thoth) must have happened in left 3/7 rulership and the 7th ray triad probably happened during right 1/5 rulership. not certain though. I figure inanna was born from jupiter somewhere in leo.
