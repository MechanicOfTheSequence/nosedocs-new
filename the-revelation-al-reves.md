# the revelation by kenny

this is a reinterpretation of the book of revelation. as I was listening to russ read chapter 13 of the [gods of eden](/docs/William_Bramley_-_The_Gods_of_Eden.pdf), I really began to think of it in a whole new light.

let's imagine for a moment that the custodial brotherhood does exist and that they do have ufos and time travel capabilitiy, they would have done a whole lot of modification on this timeline to affect things to create the future they desire to happen.

I propose that the germans aquired this technlogy from extrterrestrial entites and that tesla gave this techology to the americans before trancending space and time himself -- or perhaps he just "jumped to another body" -- or as I like to perceive it, he achieved a celestial identity status and man various "muns" or bodies in play which are extensions of his celetial identity. it's quite possible that one of those bodies is my own, and that the nature of the game is for the terrestrial identity (mun) to become conscious of his/her true (source) identity. in other words, my "future self" is just another version of the parent entity which has "self-sabotaged". inotherwords, we are a cascade of self-realising beings. the entire human race will accomplish this.

what I want to say about that is that the structure is a manifestation of the emotion (or perception), and therefore those which don't conform or harmonise with how that form (timeline) feels, can not continue to exist in that timeline. so imagine that both the nazis and the americans were given timeline technology and they are able to navigate timelines which are a harmonic with how they feel. they will perceive and navigate toward timelines (structures) which are harmonic with how they feel.

so what we will have seen is once the custodians got this technology, there will have been a whole lot of appearances of UFOs and things like that which have affected the physical conditions (like viruses and wars) to manipulate the timeline in the direction that they want it to go. the way the tecnology works is that you navigate toward the timeline that you perceive (physical conditions) which feel good to yeu within the structure of your perception. what that means is you shoot the arraw and then source paints the target around the arrow.

the book of relelation is a vision which john had which accurately makes possible the future the custodians are attracting. the future, as transmitted by them and interpreted by john will create the reality that they are desiring to manifest. this is their structure and those that are harmonic with their structure will experience a reality which feels harmonic to their structure. their structure is just one of many such structures that can possibly exist.

I will offer a second interpretation to the symbols presented, with my new understanding of who the great dragon is. in the "gods of eden" book, en'ki is the "prince of the earth" and his father anu is the king of the earth. on the world tree, enki is depicted on the right, which in ancient times is always the feminine side -- along with a crecent moon, which is also a female symbol as well. anu is on the left[^1].

tl;dr - saturn = enki = time = serpent = dragon
tl;dr - jupiter = thoth = physical = space = eagle

---

I have depicted the right (feminine) side's symbol as a cat. the left (masculine) side would be a dog. I also have recently come to understand the left is 3/7 rulership and the right is 1/5 rulership. or, inotherwords the left is physical conditions/sensations and the right is emotional conditions/sensations.

the sirians talk about saturn in lesson 9. saturn was a pterodactyl (eg. flying reptile or dragon) and was choosen by humans to be represented as satan. saturn is time (4th ray), and so what he enki/saturn did was to give humans the ability to navigate time (which is done with emotions). however emotions hadn't been very well developed yet, so most navigation of time was done with (3rd ray) structures.

the serpent is associated with saturn and enki and is the original symbol of the "brotherhood of the serpent". times were good when the serpent (saturn) was in power. jupiter (anu) is associated with space or physical and in the 3rd ray triad is thoth.

later, the sirians say that the 3rd ray triad departs and the 7th ray triad shows up which has hera (+7) with vulcan (-5) and zeus (-7). in this setup, anu's daughter, ishtar (venus, athena) is taking the form of a 7th ray female (+7), which is the opposite of what she normally is (+1)[^2].

so, what we see is an interesting transformation (like a step-down transformer), that the original two were time represented as saturn (promethus/enki, -4), and space represented as thoth (-7). they depart and then thoth is replaced with jupiter (-7) and saturn is replaced with vulcan, and the female swaps polarities as well, she goes from +3 to +7. you can see how symbolically (3), this shows the transformation of source (4) down to emotion (5) which is received in equally in the physical (7) as well as transmitted.

if you didn't follow the last bit, it doesn't matter, because it was the long way to tell you that I will be reinterpreting "satan" and the dragon as enki, saturn, prometheus, vulcan or jesus. also, in this interpretation, I will assume this is a vision transmitted by the custodians with time navigation (conceptual) technology have transmitted this vision to produce the desired (physical/spatial) reality that their technology is helping them to attract. because of this, I will interpret "God" as equal to the objective of the corrupt brotherhood or custodians (as rendered by bramley in the "gods of eden" book). I believe there is also talk of an anti-christ. I will interpret the "anti-christ" as someone who is not interested in saving anyone. somebody like me, who recognises that one's own salvation always comes from one's own efforts, and any "saviours" that promise "salvation" are just extensions of the custodial brotherhood.

finally, I want to explain that this interpretation is yet another structure. it contains symbols and predictions for the unfoldment of time which generate a feeling response in you. I want to explain that both this interpretation and the original "christian" ingerpretation of the same symbols.

like machiavelli proposes, you need to create two structures and have people fight between the two saying that their own interpretation of the structrue is the "right one", when all along, neither of the structures are the real thing that is planned to happen. both sides are "straw men" and are designed to fail. therefore, I offer this interpretation only as mental exercise to transform symbols. this concept is explored in page 116-119 in "gods of eden". this interpretation is the second structure which is designed to fail.

I would like to remind the reader that the structure (3) does not matter, because many realities are possible within the structure, but what really matters is not what the "prophecy" (structure, 3) says, but how you feel. the way you feel (and by extension your perception) is how you navigate "time" or your connection/alignment/harmony with your "source". none of this matters.

[1]: fire itself is the 4th chakra. fire is the heart or soul, and saturn is a 4th ray. emotions (3rd) are how it is navigated though. interestingly enough, I think it's important to actually look at this from the bottom up, and 1/physical = root, 2/imagination = regenrative, 3/emotional = solar plexus, 4/source = heart, 5/structure = throat, 6/relational/christ = 3rd eye, 7/desire = crown. so in order to navigate your source (fire), you use emotions.

[2]: 1st can be perceived as a 7th when looking in reverse. the best example of this would be andrea. she is a +1, but at the moment, she's playing the part of +7. 5th can also be perceived as 3rd when looking in reverse. 7th can also be 1st, and 3rd can also be 5th. desire can be manifest easily when 1 and 7 works together. time can manifest rapidly when 3 and 5 work together. they can make the reversal depending on where the rulership is placed in the consciousness. this seems to suggest that the 3rd ray triad (venus, saturn and thoth) must have happened in left 3/7 rulership and the 7th ray triad probably happened during right 1/5 rulership. not certain though. I figure inanna was born from jupiter somewhere in leo.

### percetpion of the future and attracting future timelines using symbols

I found a very old video of bramley (author of gods of eden book) @[youtube](https://youtu.be/xi-s2g0VfCE?t=2916), and in the video he said something very interesting about the "second coming", where the "rapture" was not actually something that was talked about, but something that came later with the book of revelation.

in this document I assume that the book of revelation was an addition to the timeline promoted by the custodians in order to affect the timeline outcome that the desire. I propose that conceptual vision allows for the realisation of future points in time, however, the farther you go into the "future", the less of a reality component they will have to them. the way that time works is vibrational, which means that you navigate it with your emotions. the way that something feels in one moment of time will be different than how it feels in a different moment of time. in fact, time itself as we perceive it does not exist. instead time should be seen as transformations on vibration, and these transformations give the illusion of time passing some times more rapidly than others (or even in slow motion, if many transformations are happening rapidly). therefore, the subtle transformation on the way you feel (vibration) is the passage of time.

(insert reference to the different layers of perception -- conceptual perception)

the next thing to note is that you cannot easily change what you believe at certain points in time. so, for example, if you believe that some thing happened, like (the confederate won the civil war instead of the union), and so therefore steps need to be taken to transform that belief into something different. to visualise this aspect, consider that beliefs are like fixed points (like guitar frets) and the passage of time is the vibrating string. the future is a free-floating string not attached to any set of beliefs, and so therefore to perceive and therefore attract a certain set of more likely futures, you perceive these future things in a physical format, because your imagination has no reference point to translate the vibration of physical things of the future into physical yet (cause they don't yet exist), so therefore tehy are perceived symbolically to give them meaning.

I believe that the book of revelation is one of these anchor points that the custodians used to attract the future that they want. therefore, it seems natural to me that the future that jesus perceives (based on the way he feels) will be a different version of the future than the ones that the custodians are attracting. there are quite a few details that will suggest that this is in fact what is happening.

### navigating time with physical conditions or emotionally

as outlined on "gods of eden", bramley gives considerable evidence that the custodians have been influencing this timeline in the form of UFOs and such. what this tells me is that the custodians (are likely the german nazis and) acquired time travel technology in some manner (probably by tesla), and have been affecting the timeline to try and accomplish the future that they want (as outlined in the book of revelation). they have to accomplish this physically, and so likely they had to try many different things to affect a different outcome.

imagine for their point of view -- as we approach this next 12ky cycle, energies will rise considerably and they will eventually run out of an earth suitable for them to occupy. they likely believe that they are the ones that are in control of the earth, and the last thing they want would be for a bunch of humans to figure out become space-faring and more powerful than they. they need to retain their superiority.

I imagine that originally the nazis won WW2, and they got time travel technology. they looked into the future to figure out what was happening and sure they won the war, but as humans gained the ability to control their emotions, the humans became flying beings that cold levitate things. they lose all their ability to control, so they have to now begin to affect the timeline so that humans are considerably weaker (viruses, plagues, false narratives, etc.) to ensure that humans do not figure out how to realise they are eternal beings and that they can navigate time with their emotions.

the custodians now have the extremely arduous task of going back through time and trying to affect the conditions physically in order to prevent humans from feeling good enough to have all of these super-human capabilities. I think this has to happen because they mention this great foe which they cannot seem to find a way to avoid: the devil -- the serpeent of old which "deceived" humankind: enki.

I think it was realised after much trial and error that they simply would not be able to control it all, and so therefore had to compromise with a timeline that they felt like they are in control. a split would occur. the custodians would go their way with their "christ" in power and that old surpent defeated. this timeline was interpretted as a series of symbols and the book of revelation outlines these symbols in a way which is compelling for people who just want some sort of saviour to come and rescue them. in order to give the illusion that their "christ" won the battle, they will "rapture" all of the followers of christ out of the timeline to a new one where there aren't any pesky anti-christ (enki) figures, and the custodians can have their "1000 years of peace" (lol).

### the rapture

in that video bramley mentions that jesus teaches that when the kingdom of spirit comes, a bunch of bad people would disappear. this opposes the concept presented in the book of revelation where the followers of christ will be zapped away to a utopia. this concept of bad people disappearing makes way more sense from a vibrational perspective. if a bunch of people are all feeling pretty good -- like they are the creators of their reality, this will oppose the custodial belief where they are in control of people's reality. if the concept that you create your reality with your thoughts and so therefore reality reflects how you feel, eventually I bifrication will happen where the people who need their reality created for them can no longer exist in a reality of deliberate cresators.

you can recognise the people who need their reality created for them. they are the people that don't want to think for theirselves, they need a saviour or for someone to zap them away to a promised 1000 years of peace. from the custodial perspective, the people they will take with them will be the ones who aren't a problem. if you are capable of feeling the way you want to feel dispite the conditions, then they don't want you, and won't zap you away to their "utopia".

the reason for this logically is easy to follow: if you feel self-empowered, you are not vibrationally compatible with their timeline and so therefore do not fit with the symbols they have outlined.

so the picture that emerges is that both concepts are true (and probably a few more). from jesus' perspective of feeling good, self-empowered and that your reality is a reflection of your thought, the bad people will eventually disappear when the energy levels rise up (spirit of truth coms) and they are no loger compatible. the same story will also be true from the custodial perspective too. they will avoid the coming spirit of truth. because under those energettic conditions anyone can know anything about anyone -- so therefore power and control are difficult because anything can be known (so no more secrets). the custodians will remain in the lower energy state where they can retain their control.

in order to do this, I suspect they need to perform quite an illusion. the illusion that is revealed in the vision is that there will be a coming "christ" at the end which will bring the 1000 years of peace. this must be the same "man-child that will rule the earth with an iron rod". the iron rod symbolism usually means very forecfully, so I guess the peace only exists because he is able to exert powerful control for about 1000 years -- if the 1000 years is even a real thing. it's quite likely (as bramley points out), that the 1000 years is a sham to get people to believe in who want a braek from perceived endless war[^1].

so, what we see is the custodians manipulating conditions to affect the time, and promising other conditional peoole (not reality creators) that their conditions will suddenly change during the rapture. instead, I propose that I want to change how I feel, and then let my reality reflect that. reading between the lines here, it seems ovbious to me that this is a bifrication of people who believe they are eternal and know how to navigate time with their emotions (enki), and the people who need conditions to change (rapture) for them to allow theirselves feel better (1000 years of peace).

[1]: no one who is creating their own reality wants "peace". people who perceive endless war want peace.
