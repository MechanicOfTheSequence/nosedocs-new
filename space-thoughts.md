## interesting things in space

- jupiter has 8 vorticies around a centre (9) on the north pole and 5 vorticies arround a centre (6) vortex on the south pole
- juper has counter-rotating winds -- same direction as it's rotation and also opposite

- saturn has 6 voticies in a hexagonal shape on the north, and one big one in the south pole
- enceledus has constant water jets shooting out of its south pole

- neptune has clouds and wind which go opposite its retation. no wind going the same direction
- triton rotates retrograde (similar to venus)
- triton appears to be very similar in composition to pluto

- uranus and neptune have very similar compositions
  - uranus emits very little heat (probably because of its axial tilt) while neptune does emit a lot mere heat.
  - some rocky (silicate?) core with water around it, and then a layer of liquid hydrogen (seems similar to saturn as well)
  - uranus and netune both have a greater than 50(degrees) difference in axial tilt and magnetic field alignment

- triton orbits backwards from neptune's rotation (like the wind)
- triton also has an inclined, but extremely circular orbit
  - inclined suggests captured
  - circular suggests not captured
  - could have been captured from a binary (or trinary) system -- like perhaps with pluto and charon
    - I find it possible that there is a lot of similarity between triton, pluto, charon, and ceres.
      - could these could have come from "tiamat?
