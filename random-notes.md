Saturn and Jupiter will conjunct on 12/21/2020 in the first degree of Aquarius. Joel 2:28 states that in the last days the Lord will pour out his spirit on all flesh. In 1986 Uranus, who is Anu, began leaking atmosphere.  Saturn and Jupiter form a resonance whose combined gravitational mass pulls on Mercurys orbit and causes retrograde.  Imagine when those two conjunct in December.  It's going to set off a chain reaction, a true marriage of the eagle and serpent and cause Michael, who is represented by the Sun to rise up against the dragon.

The Annuaki referred to the inner solar system as the zone of confusion and blamed Venus.  Nothing gets to earth without passing through the orbit of Venus, and for this reason she is known as the Queen of Heaven.  In the story of Enki and Inanna, Inanna challenged Enki to a drinking contest and gained possession of the Mes, which she then used to found Uruk and put Sumeria on the map.  Venus is the Roman name for the planet, but her first name on earth is Inanna. Sumeria was gradually overthrown and absorbed by Marduk, who is Mars.  The story of Mars and Venus caught in a net gives you an idea of how well this went.  Jupiter was forced to intervene and Neptune agreed to pay the penalty, which is a reference to the flood.

1st - serpent (aquatic apes - tigris (blonde hair blue eyes))
    - atlantian (saturn) (hg r1b)
  -> mixed land apes -> adams & eves
2nd - eagle (serpents + eves)
    - ancient greek/athenian (zeus) (hg r1a)
  -> wiped out serpents (red-headed giants) in americas
3rd - lion (bavaria, paletine)
  -> comes from lost tribes of israel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHsU7Icu3H4
  -> sythians tatooed/connected with gryphon (lion+eagle)


  -> communist symbol: hammer (thor/eagle) & sickle (saturn/serpent)
    -> flying serpent (eagle+serpent) = dragon? - symbolic of combination/alliance of serpent+eagle?

atlantis
neptune + cleito
  -> 5x twin boys
  - atlas

seems during atlantis, the sun rose in the west and set in the east.
  -> if a catacmysm were to happen during the middle of an age, and the earth were to be flipped so that S = N & N = S, then on spring equinox, the sun would *set* in taurus, not rise... (does that mean that it would appear to rise in scorpio??)
atlantis invades greece and greece wins (jupiter defeats saturn)
-> 10kbc cataclysm of earthquakes and deluge
 - velikovski links this to saturn and how he got his rings.
 - I also have noticed that when the saturn symbols in my life have felt defeated or are in some termoil, then it rains strongly.

in this sense, the eagle defeated the serpent
somehow, this relates to venus (5 pointed star?).
-> in theogeny, when saturn castrates uranus, the blood falling into the ocean makes venus
  - this is likely the same story as lucifer (venus) falling to earth
  - was venus (ishtar) was worshipped before the deluge??
  - is the blood falling into the ocean the same deluge that happened when jupiter defeated cronos (seems doubtful to me. probably a previous deluge. was it a pre-event that is recorded as the sinking of the outer islands of atlantis?)

weird stuff:
- zeus' 7th wife was his sister hera
  - hera is mother to ares
- zeus gave birth to athena from the forehead (neocortex) of zeus
- hera is angered at zeus giving birth to athena, so she gave birth to vulcan
- vulcan's wife venus shags aries (mars)
  - mars and venus dave a child, harmonia, which marries cadmus (phonecian), first king of thebes
- jupiter in christianity is st. peter
- in one version, zeus' first wife is metis, who bears athena. metis has powerful children and is scared if she bears him a son, he will overthrow zeus, so he swallows her. metis goes to work on a helmet for her daughter, which caused zeus great pain. vulcan hit zeus on the head and athena was born
  -> however, this is impossible cause metis is zeus' first wife and hera is zeus 7th and final wife, which are vulcan's parents; vulcan didn't exist yet.

- book of revelation informs us that the dragon is the devil and satan -- meaning the adversary, or one who resists
- the merovingian dynasty asserts the divine right of their nobility to rule the world as an angelic race of demigods whos ancestors, they claim, were the fallen angels

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue)
world soul: 3 elements (1 indivible, 1 divisible)
- Sameness (one indivisible and another divisible)
- Difference (again, one indivisible and another divisible)
- Being/Existence (one indivisible and another divisible)

From this emerged three compound substances, intermediate (or mixed) Being, intermediate Sameness, and intermediate Difference. From this compound one final substance resulted, the World Soul.[6] He then divided following precise mathematical proportions, cutting the compound lengthways, fixed the resulting two bands in their middle, like in the letter Χ (chi), and connected them at their ends, to have two crossing circles. The demiurge imparted on them a circular movement on their axis: the outer circle was assigned Sameness and turned horizontally to the right, while the inner circle was assigned to Difference and turned diagonally and to the left (34c-36c).

#### venus & vulcan

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQo3GvXO-VI

in norse mythology, frig or freyja is the wife of the god odin. clearly freyja is venus, and odin is a one-eyed terrible guy. I find the correlation betwwen the traditional one-legged injured husband of vulcan and the one-eyed injured odin bit, a little interesting.

qbaba - sumkrian king on the kings list (linked to venus)

#### deal with the devil story

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flJQxNqUWS0
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DealWithTheDevil/FolkloreAndFairyTales

One story has a wily blacksmith who sells his soul to the Devil in return for the magical power to stick anything to anything (hey, that's useful for a smith). When the Devil sends first his son and then his daughter to collect on the bargain, the smith uses his magic powers to not only stop them but embarrass them until they go away. Then the Devil declares he has to do the job himself, and fails. The smith tells him that if he can just live out is natural life the Devil is jolly welcome to take his soul when that day comes... but when that day comes, the Devil gets so horrified at the idea of having the smith down there, that he screams that the deal is off and tells the smith to get himself packing to Heaven. Which let him in. Apparently, trolling the devil counters engaging in black magic deals.

In "Bearskin", a soldier makes a Deal With The Devil, who will give him an ever-filled purse, but he must not pray, wash, cut his hair or nails, or change from a bearskin for seven years. He goes about distributing money to the poor, asking them to pray for him. One man he rescues from financial distress promises that he may marry one of his daughters. Only the youngest is willing. He succeeds in fulfilling the devil's terms and cleans up nicely, and the older sisters, reduced to envy, commit suicide. The Devil, pleased at his dumb luck, informs the soldier that he got two souls, not one.
Rather than dumb luck, this is likely a Xanatos Gambit.

### kuthumi's extra-terrestrial view of creation notes

solar system claims:
  they claim that there are 12 planets around sol that were habitable.
    this must include what we call moons, too.
    one of them was blown to bits (between mars and jupiter), so 11?
  they claim that jupiter is "one of the biggest planets in the solar system"
    as far as I know, jupiter *is* the biggest. what one is bigger? nibiru?
    supposedly, nibiru had water and is obviously habitable too.
  they claim that when work began (5.7Mya), jupiter was the 6th planet.
    it seems likely to me that venus was captured sometime relatively recently (5-20kya)
    it may also be possible that mercury is somewhat new as well, considering the pachas theory

  they claim that earth, mars, and zyron (tiamat) were the most suitable for life, but they don't explain what happened to zyron.
    if this is correct, earth isn't zyron and didn't come from the half of zyron.
    thing is, it does look like earth was half of a planet, with all continents spreading out and expanding from hemisphere, so I don't know there...
  zyron was also said to have been used, along with earth and mars in the next phase of developent ("Plans were made to utilize the resources of the 5th; 4th; and 3rd planet in the next phase of development.")
- mars populated with the INFECTED ONES
  - the clones were created from the genetic structure of the coalition
  - magnetised to "pull in those INFECTED ONES that inhabited the alien vehicles in the Pleiades and the other Solar System not yet named on the other side of the Galaxy."
    - the solar system on the other side of the Pleiades (which is next to taurus), is antares (scorpio)
- 2 destructions of earth's population
- about 1Mya, the humans were upgraded into much more advanced versions, and instead of being imbiciles, the energy was split, such that one entity split it's consciousness into 12 bodies: 6 males and 6 females (so, at least 12 times more powerful).
  - this configuration is strangely similar to the "titans" which gaia produced with uranus, which were also 6 males and 6 females -- though I doubt this is the same thing.
  - these eventually individualised about 500kya.
- 100kya the final versions of the humans were prepared for the planet.
- when concetrations of humans were in a single area, the higher population density produced imbalances in the planet (because of their symbiotic relationship with the planet and part of the planetary consciousness) which caused geological upheaval (eg. attracting a number of catastrohes).

- atlas is an interesting idea for me because he is told he needs to hold up the heavans.
  - this gives me the image of the concentric spheres that may involve the "inner earth"
  - additionally, after the fight between the olympians and the atlantians, they were banished to a lower earth dwelling, tartarus -- almost as if the inner earth is where the remnants of the atlantians live and dwell since the battle.
- since the idea of holding up the heavens could also be referring to the "celestial spheres", then this could be referring to the addition of another celestial sphere
  - this sort of coincides with my theory that the planet mercury was created as a result of the great pyramid's transformation of the planetary energies into something else during the massive influx of energy which happened around the same time as the deluge which is when atlantis was submerged.

### seth

- cain (farmer) kills his brother abel (shepherd)
  - seth in the replaces abel as the "righteous" line of adam
- in the osiris myth set(h) kills his father osiris (saturn?) and isis (sirius) rebuilds osiris long enough to conceive horus
  - this could be a retelling of the saturn castrating uranus story, but recast like saturn (osiris) is the victim to his own son
  - this could be the idea that saturn's son (jupiter) dethrones his father (saturn) as ruler of the sky
    - saturn originally the ruler of the sky title from uranus.
      - a long time age, before uranus had his pole perpendicular to the sun's, he may have been quite a bit brighter than now.
    - if this was the case, then saturn mush have done something to put his pole out of alignment (castrate him), making saturn now the brightest
    - atfter the deluge, saturn clearly becomes less bright, and now jupiter is less bright
      - I suuupose this is from  a massive loss in saturn's hydrogen atmosphere (which mixes with o2 on earth to make water)
    - jupiter gives birth to a daughter athena (venus?)
      - she is recorded destructively as a lioness, and nice as a cow
    - hera gives birth to velcan but is thrown cast down by jupiter
      - velcan could be the "reborn" version of "typhon", destroyed by jupiter when typhon tried to become most powerful
        - typhon may be the former self of what is now known as the kuiper belt
  - senenmut has on his star chart that osiris is saturn and horus is jupiter

### plato's hephaestus/vulcan

"Xanthus, and men call Scamander"
"Speak you of the princely lord of light (Phaeos istora)?"
"Hephaestus and Athene, who were brother and sister, and sprang from the same father, having a common nature, and being united also in the love of philosophy and art"

"The appointed hour was approaching when man in his turn was to go forth into the light of day; and Prometheus, not knowing how he could devise his salvation, stole the mechanical arts of Hephaestus and Athene, and fire with them (they could neither have been acquired nor used without fire), and gave them to man."
"Thus man had the wisdom necessary to the support of life, but political wisdom he had not; for that was in the keeping of Zeus, and the power of Prometheus did not extend to entering into the citadel of heaven, where Zeus dwelt, who moreover had terrible sentinels; but he did enter by stealth into the common workshop of Athene and Hephaestus, in which they used to practise their favourite arts, and carried off Hephaestus’ art of working by fire, and also the art of Athene, and gave them to man. And in this way man was supplied with the means of life. But Prometheus is said to have been afterwards prosecuted for theft, owing to the blunder of Epimetheus."



### baal, baalbek, jupiter and saturn

the romans, after conquering baalbek, in attempt to unify rome under the god of jupiter, told people that baal was jupiter, and that they were workshiping the same god.

however, previous to that, the catrhagenian chronos, baal hammon was the chief god with whom they offered child sacrifices to.

this is the sam caananite god molech, associated with child sacrifice -- specifically, in a giant bronze statue of aa bull

### baal hammon

phonecian chief god of carthage, responsible for fertility of vegetation, image is "king of gods", shown with a beard and rams horns.

often seen with his consort "tanit", which has a lot of similarities to astarte (ishtar, venus). depicted in the form of a lioness and also associated with child sacrifice

### exodus

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/FlnGSMtyBe0?t=1394) postulates that it was 101.5 cycles back, in -1306.81 (oct-22) the battle with amalek (exodus)

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/sp3HtKU6I4U?t=326) postulates that passover was sept-11 -1306

### solar cycle hemisphere synced

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/TR4DQDw29BI?t=580)

nothing particularly interesting here, unless you correlate the hemisperes to my own and star-watching / visual capacity

blue (northern) = my right (physical, visual, desire)
yellow (southern) = my left (logic, programming, emotion)

it's very loose correlation though. some things match quite well (like the boost to yellow in 2014).

other things don't really match, like for example sharp decline of yellow at end of 2012, but if there is a correlation, then the yellow (logic/emotion) should be more enhanced in 2020 because I have quite a bit more mastery over them now, while my desire and physical capability has significantly dropped.

1:04:00 - in the previous images of the quasars, they appear to have jets shooting out of the poles. in that picture too, it looks like there is a north and south pole too. all the time massive amounts of solar wind shoots out of our sun's poles. however, the quasars also appear to have another emanation coming out radially, especially like when they begin to become galaxies. that radial emanation looks like the rings around saturn and appears at the equator.

what that clock pattern in the previous slide seems to suggest is that something comes out in the positive, and then something comes out in the negative, each time it crosses the plane there. that seems to indicate to me that planck second (or whatever) these things are popping out of the poles there. the size of the thing seems to determine how often this happens (clock divider)

so, for an atom I could imagine then that every time interval, an electron pops out of the south pole and a proton(?) pops out of the north pole. these shoot out and then settle into one of the alternating electron(-) and proton(+) shells around the atom (like the ionosphere shells on earth), maybe because the north ones are spinning the opposite direction of the southern ones, meaning they would repel one another much like all magnets spin in the same direction, and only if they are facing each other or away from each other do they attract or have a repulsive effect. the number of electrons in the shell would be determined by the size of the centre point (planet, atom, whatever) -- eg. how many of them you can fit into there. planets can probably fit 10^60 or more and an atom can only fit some amount of their atomic number. they float around there for a while, probably settling into a stable geometric configuration until decaying at inverse square. for an atom, the duration of these emanations happen very frequently and last a short period of time, but something like a star this would only happen every 12068y.

for a galaxy (or quasar), these polar emanations, which later form into stars, which theirselves last for a very long time (essentially forever) so the galaxy seems to extend out for as long as the galaxy has existed. I think that's possibly why the massive 10 trillion star galaxy can exist -- it's just been pumping stars out for a really long time now.

it seems like this rate of emanation happens based on the definition of the entity -- galaxies being the slowest, and atoms (or subatomic particles) being the fastest. it's pretty likely that this entity unit size progression is fractal, so there are perhaps infinite subatomic particles. therefore, I could imagine that each thing emanates accroding to its structure (defined by the information coming in), and so each of these smaller structures emanate at a divisible clock rate: cells, then organisations of cells, like humans or large trees, then planets, then suns, then galaxies etc. -- where each polar emanation is of the magnitude of the (?) of that entity a harmonic of the carrier wave? makes me think this could be how trees grow brenches on their north pole and roots on their south pole and radially create bark/tree rings.

I hope that's pretty close to what you have... anyway, following that idea, when the 12068y interval happens on our star, it would suggest that a massive amount of material would either come out of the south or north pole (depending on the spike direction there), and all around the star would essentially flare simultaneously, with the majority of the material coming out of thee equator?

anyway, I've watched nearly all of your videos now (only missing 14 from series 4 -- it's a long series!), and this is the best I've pieced together all of the information into a cohesive thought. am I close?

### polar reversals

I believe that on aquarius<->lion axis there is a reversal of rotation direction, and on the scorpio<->bull axis, there is an optional flipping over that occurs if the planet goes up or down a power level. I just found more evidence of this in praveen's video today here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/AvmoH5cvXBM?t=83).

you can see 13 divisions of the circle, and off to the rigt, it appears that two of the divisions are in a bigger division. this must be the composite symbol of scorpio which is half serpent (ophiuchus), half eagle. the red like going down the centre there must be showing a change in rotatiotn with the cresent to the left or right of the circle.

the x-axis there is marked by a square with an x in it which must be the symbol for the flipping over of the planet.

my theory is is that there are two things going on. first, the planet is in a 24ky orbit with sirius, and that the planet will continue to experience the same procession of the equinoxes of the zodiac for each half of a cycle. the closest pointand furthest point from sirius will occur when the planet is looking at scorpio or taurus. halfway to sirius, the earth will reverse it's direction right before reaching aquarius or right before reaching leo.
