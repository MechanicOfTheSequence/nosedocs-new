Source or inspiration of teachings is said to be a god, angel, or supernatural force; not a human being.
Source or inspiration of teachings is said to be an identifiable human being.
Physical immortality is an important or desired goal in many Custodial religions.
Adherence to doctrine, based upon faith or obedience alone, is stressed.
Severe or fatal physical punishments are sometimes employed or advocated during the religion's history to deal with nonbelievers or backsliders.
Belief that being born in a human body, either once or many times through reincarnation, is part of a broad spiritual plan which will ultimately benefit every human being.
Belief that there are "higher forces," "gods," or supernatural entities which control people's individual or collective fates. Human beings have no control over those forces and can only yield to them.
Belief that only one Supreme Being alone created the physical universe.
Human suffering, toil, and enslavement are part of a broader spiritual plan which will ultimately lead to salvation and freedom for those who obediently endure it.
Spiritual recovery and salvation depend entirely upon the grace of "God" or other supernatural entity.

#### maverick
Belief in a single Supreme Being, or God, is a principle cornerstone of faith. (In earlier times, worship of many humanlike "gods.")
Belief in a Supreme Being is usually tolerated, but is a minor or nonexistent part of doctrine. Emphasis is placed on the role of the individual spiritual being in relation to the universe.
Spiritual freedom and immortality are sought. Endless existence in the same physical body is deemed unimportant or undesirable.
Observation and reason are held to be the proper foundations for adhering to a doctrine.
Physical punishments or duress are very mild to nonexistent. Severest punishment is usually formal exclusion of an individual from the religious organization.
Belief that there is no hidden spiritual purpose to human existence and that the process of death-amnesia-rebirth causes spiritual decay.
Belief that all people are ultimately responsible for having created their own conditions in life, good and bad, by thenown actions and inactions, and that all people can ultimately control their own destinies.
Belief that everyone has something to do with the creation and/or perpetuation of the physical universe.
Human suffering, toil, and enslavement are social ills that have no constructive purpose and stand in the way of spiritual salvation and freedom.
Spiritual recovery and salvation are entirely up to the individual to achieve through his or her own selfmotivated effort.


### 24 elders: the new priesthood (yay)

```
... I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard, which sounded like a trumpet talking with me; said Come up here, and
I will show you things which must take place hereafter.
And immediately I was in the spirit: and, look, a
throne was set in heaven, and one [creature] sat on
the throne.
And the one who sat looked to me like a jasper and
sardine stone: and there was a rainbow around the
throne looking like an emerald.
And all around the throne were twenty-four seats:
and upon the seats I saw twenty-four elders sitting,
clothed in white garments: and they had on their heads
crowns of gold.
And out of the throne came lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire
burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits
of God.
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like
crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round
And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and
twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each of them
holding harps, and golden containers full of odors,
which are the prayers of saints.
the Root of David, has succeeded to open the book,
and to loosen its seven seals.
And I saw standing between the throne and the four
beasts, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb in the
manner of having been slain, having seven horns and
seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent
out to all the earth.
And he came and took the book out of the right hand
of the one who sat upon the throne.
And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and
twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each of them
holding harps, and golden containers full of odors,
which are the prayers of saints.
And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to
take the book, and to open the seals of it: for you were
slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood from
every family, language, people, and nation:
And have made us into kings and priests to God: and
we shall reign on earth.
And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels
around the throne and the beasts and the elders: and
they numbered ten thousand times ten thousand, and
thousands of thousands;
Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that
was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom,
and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
And every creature which is in heaven, and on the
earth, and under the earth, and those that are in the
sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits
upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.
And the four beasts said, Amen. And the twenty-four
elders fell down and worshipped him that lived for
ever and ever.

zoroaster's 4 phases of (12ky) for the earth
a perfect example of the framing (form/structure) of the concept, appears to constrain the conscept, holding power over it, but the concept itself can only be resonant with its "time" (which is how you feel)
custodial religion vs maverick religion (and how both of them play into the biger LOA based picture)

the real serpents (betrayers) and the corrupt brotherhood (the bad bad-guys)
  the real phoenix (the good bad-guys) and the alchemical process
the red dragon

they're eating/believing their own medicine (corrupt doctrines). it's LOA, so they are attracting what they're reframing these conmepts into
there is no good or bad guys anymore. lines are too blurred, and at this point it's all perceptual.
we've probably are beginning or are already are taking this idea of getting the "bad-guys" to push against the good ideas, to continue to make better and better ones.

it's all perceptual

materialism is important because you can't control someone who doesn't believe they have anything to lose.
  you will believe rediculous ideas if you believe they will preserve your (valuable) posessions
