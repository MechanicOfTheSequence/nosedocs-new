### SSS - super secret symbol

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=3530)

the holy of holies
hebrew: devir
has ark (heart) between two pillars (cherubs)

stiletto sidech solo
(residence of) the sovereign master of all things
the three candlesticks - the three degrees of fire

- (where two or three are *gathered together*)
  - greek word for tathered together: syna-goge
  - left pillar
    - left hemishere - masculine - logic, location, syncronisation
  - two pillars + one ark = 2 or three gathered together
    - very likely that the two pillars refer to the duality of the human (male/female, light/dark, etc)
      - this makes the ark the heart
    - could also be the synchronisation of the two hemispheres
      - this makes the ark the pineal

- (in my name)
  - IAM (that) IAM - TH
  - rigwt pillar
    - right hemisphere - feminine - emotion, feeling (state of mind)
  - there's a weird symetry here:
    - "where two or three" is referring to the holy of holies (SSS)
    - "in my name" is referring to IAM (that) IAM
      - "in" which you would think is a location
      - but the location "my name" (SSS) is already stated
      - so it has to be in another state (probably of the mind)

- there I AM
  - self referential to the first part, like saying the two pillars are the two pillars (which have two pillars)
    - the two pillars (SSS, which has two pillars) + the state of mind (TH) (IAM (that) IAM) which has also two pillars (IAM (divine) + AMI (human))
    - I-AM + AM-I | divinity + humanity
      - there are the two pillars of divine nature and human nature (which need to be balanced
      - interesting also to note here the same with the compass + square


### compass + square

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=2958)

- compass
  - divinity
    - cycles / eternal / never ending
  - triangle up
    - pyramid
    - fire
    - masculine
  - compass creates a circle
- square
  - humanity
    - earth
  - triangle down
    - water
    - feminine
  - square creates straight lines

- the balance between the two is for feminine to make straight lines, and for masculine to make circles
- there's another weird thing in the genesis symbols:
  - the the square (earth) is a feminine symbol (triangle down), yet God created man (adam) from the earth.
  - the compass (divinity), is the masculine symbol (triangle up), however God created woman (eve) from adam in likeness of Himself (divinity)
- the square is the circle & the circle is the square (squaring the circle)


### sonnet 121 - uses the name of God

```
noe, I am that I am
and they that luell
at my abuses
rekon up their owne,
I may be straight through they them-
selues be beuel
by their ranke thoughts, my deedes must not be shown
```

### TTT = TH = IAM (that) IAM = AM-I-AM

god: there I AM
jesus: there AM I


AM-I-AM
AM (that) I AM

short code: TTT (tripie tau)
