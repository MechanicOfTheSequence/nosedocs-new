### SSS - super secret symbol

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=3530)

the holy of holies
hebrew: devir
has ark (heart) between two pillars (cherubs)

stiletto sidech solo
(residence of) the sovereign master of all things
the three candlesticks - the three degrees of fire

- (where two or three are *gathered together*)
  - 2 points = line
  - 3 points = triangle
  - greek word for tathered together: syna-goge
  - left pillar
    - left hemishere - masculine - logic, location, syncronisation
  - two pillars + one ark = 2 or three gathered together
    - very likely that the two pillars refer to the duality of the human (male/female, light/dark, etc)
      - this makes the ark the heart
    - could also be the synchronisation of the two hemispheres
      - this makes the ark the pineal

- (in my name)
  - IAM (that) IAM - TTT - TH
  - rigwt pillar
    - right hemisphere - feminine - emotion, feeling (state of mind)
  - there's a weird symetry here:
    - "where two or three" is referring to the holy of holies (SSS)
    - "in my name" is referring to IAM (that) IAM
      - "in" which you would think is a location
      - but the location "my name" (SSS) is already stated
      - so it has to be in another state (probably of the mind)

- there I AM
  - self referential to the first part, like saying the two pillars are the two pillars (which have two pillars)
    - the two pillars (SSS, which has two pillars) + the state of mind (TH) (IAM (that) IAM) which has also two pillars (IAM (divine) + AMI (human))
    - I-AM + AM-I | divinity + humanity
      - there are the two pillars of divine nature and human nature (which need to be balanced
      - interesting also to note here the same with the compass + square


### compass + square

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=2958)

- compass
  - divinity
    - cycles / eternal / never ending
  - triangle up
    - pyramid
    - fire
    - masculine
  - compass creates a circle
- square
  - humanity
    - earth
  - triangle down
    - water
    - feminine
  - square creates straight lines

- the balance between the two is for feminine to make straight lines, and for masculine to make circles
- there's another weird thing in the genesis symbols:
  - the the square (earth) is a feminine symbol (triangle down), yet God created man (adam) from the earth.
  - the compass (divinity), is the masculine symbol (triangle up), however God created woman (eve) from adam in likeness of Himself (divinity)
- the square is the circle & the circle is the square (squaring the circle)




### TTT = TH = IAM (that) IAM = AM-I-AM

god: there I AM
jesus: there AM I


AM-I-AM
AM (that) I AM

short code: TTT (tripie tau)

----

IAM the Alpha and Omega
IAOM

MAOI
OMAMI
IMAMO

---

divinity: to be
humanity: !to be


sonnet 121 - uses the name of God
```
noe, I am that I am
  and they that luell at my abuses
rekon up their owne,
I may be straight through they them-
  selves be beuel
by their ranke thoughts,
  my deedes must not be shown
```

noe = noah
luell = symbol 1
beuel = symbol 2

> The square and the compass have a 90° relationship with one another, representing their operations in multiple dimensions.  The masculine compass operates on the "y" axis while the feminine square operates on the "x" axis.  Of further interest is the realization that the square determines the confines and place within space (the x axis [and 'z' axis technically]) while the compass has no choice but to create (through spin) at the space-time of the squares choosing.   The feminine square (matter) has the ability to move within three dimensional space (because the feminine is literally the coalescence of matter in space aka "form"), while the masculine compass is the spirit (or mind/thought), having only the ability to cause but requiring the feminine square to choose the confines and form of the cause.  

> Of further note is the observation of placing a compass' points at the ends of the square.  When one does this you create an optical illusion of a diamond shape.  In reality you have a square operating on the flat, horizontal plane, while the compass is operating in the 3 dimensional, vertical plane.  When looking at the two from a 2d perspective you create a diamond which can collapse on itself and return to 0, thus being representative of expansion of consciousness through dimensionality.


- compass
  - masculine
  - y-axis (vertical)
- square
  - feminine
  - x-axis (horizonal)

huh, I never noticed that feminine square confines space or matter (mater/mother). that's cool.
I didn't understand your second thought: I see the diamond, but I don't understand how you mean by it collapsing on itself. do you mean that it points directly at the perspective so that it appears as a line again, where new spatial dimension is directly perpendicular to the line (coming "at you")?

---

I'm just going to talk this out, in attempt to figure it out...
while thinking about the above, I remembered another part of the video he talks about "when two or three ..." (I thought it was "two or more", not "or three", so it must be significant) "... are gathered together" (eg. in synagoge, SSS, holy of holies) the 2 or 3 bit stood out to me. inside the holy of holies is 1 ark and two pillars. the one seems implied, so the emphasis is on the 2 or 3 bit. 2 points = a line, and 3 points = a triagle and I think they illustrate what you're trying to say.

- a line in 2d:
  - if you rotate it you get a circle
    - in this sense, a rotating line is behaving like a compass
    - it's showing the plane that it's already in
  - when the line is rotated so it's perpendicular to itself (which you can only find out by drawing the circles, btw)
    - you get a cross, which is sort of like a compass open to 90°

- a line in 3d:
  - if you rotate it, you get:
    - an ellipse (or circle)
    - a single point
      - a return back to its origin or singularity
      - this can show evidence of a new spatial dimension (between the perspective and the apparent point)

- if you rotate a triangle in 2d you just get a plane (that it's alraedy in)
- if you rotate a triangle in 3d:
  - it can appear as a line
    - the space between the perspective and the triangle appearing as a line (perpendicular to the apparent line) is another spatial dimension
  - until it appears like a square (45-45-90)
    - you get another spatial dimension (on the 'z' axis).
    - also, when appearing like a square, it represents a line again (a return back to the beginning)

in other words, a line (2) rotated in 3d, can collapse back to one, or expand the space. however a triangle (3) rotated in 3d can collapse back to a line (2), or show the evidence of 2 new spatial dimensions which can be expanded to. this appears to be infinite.

going back now to tie it together... if you look at the rotation of the line (2 points), it behaves like a compass, drawing a circle. so, in this sense, the line must be masculine. however, if you rotate a triangle (3 points) in 3d, it behaves like a straight-edge (square), and when it "collapses on itself", it reveales the evidence of another spatial dimension perpendicular of the line, the expansion of consciousness. it also has another expansion, when the triangle appears to have a 90° angle to it, then it shows another spatial dimension on the 'z' axis, appearing perpedicular to the other two lines.

off topic: in this sense, if you consider that the expanded form of perception for men is 1 extra dimension, however the feminine expansion of consciousness is 2 extra dimensions. this is a whole another conversaion on what that means, however, if you were to find balanced in your masculinity and femininity (eg. square the circle), you would gain 3 extra dimensions :) that's pretty cool...

- timeline:
  - goes to egypt in may
  - two weeks later (june 1) speaks at contact in the desert confrence in front of robert shock
  - week after that (june 7th?), discovers qusi prime numbers
  - later says goes to egypt in february
- zedichia's cave
  - ark of covenant on limestone, but the limestone has been turned to quartz
  - alpha/omega in enscribed into the of quartz

- da vinci vetruvian man goemetry
  - @[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=3592).
    - there you see that the circle incribed inside of the square, has the centre point over the reproductive organ (imagination 6th ray).
    - later, when you rise the circle up to the naval/solar plexus (emotion emotion 5th ray), then 6 perfect pyramid crosssections are revaled along with the earth/moon geometrical relationship.
      - clearly this device has something to do with stepping down (like a transformer) energy passing sun -> moon -> earth
  - @[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=3739)
    - in this diagram, the root chakra is the location of the regenerative, and the sloar plexus is wayy higher than it should be, right around where I feel constant tension in my lungs.
      - interesting to note that emtion is correlated with air, so it makes sense for it to move up to the lungs.
      - in my system of hor the chakras retate, they are a bit different than the mainstream version of them:
        - root = earth = physical
        - regenrative = water = imagination
        - solar pluxus = air = emotion
        - heart = fire = source (midpoint)
        - throat = not physical = structure/logic (intellectual willpower)
        - agna/3rd eye = not physical = relationsl / communication / conceptual-interconnectedness
        - crown = not physical = desire (emotional willpower)
      - my system seems to make a whole lot more sense on this vetruvian man now, because it gives the blueprint for the new man (the aquarian man):
        - imagination used to be strongly connected to the regenerative in the old way of thinking.
          - for the aquarian man, imqagination is now connected to the old centre for emotions at the naval (solar plexus)
        - air / emotition has now moved to the lungs (breathing, prana, chi)
          - this means that in the aquarian man, emotion is translated directly into prana/chi energy. you literally breathe this energy
          - come up with a better way to explain this concept -- other than your emotions literally form the energetic reality around you.
          - lungs are cubic in nature, so therefore this is connected to the goddess energy
          - emotions will take on a new form.
        - now it makes sense that thought (throat) and emotion (lungs) have an inverse relation to each other now.
          - if emotion is now cubic, does this mean that througt is spherical? (alan tslked about this with the meeting with nassim)
          - I also used to feel a strong (not good feeling) vibration in my throat when strong thinkers would try and influence my reality in a strong way, which contradicted the source version of my reality. I could tell that this effect seemed to be strongly associated with thoughts of future predictions that were in disharmony with their (and my) source. eg. when I would point out some of mr. motor's BS, I could feel him think some awful feeling thought about how much people would hate him. I would feel that thought in my non-physical feeler, and feel the discord of that feeling in my throat
        - it also now makes sense the connection between non-physical counterparts:
          - pineal now connects to the naval (physical emotions)
          - lungs (non-physical grid) to throat
          - regenerative (root) now connects to the crown (desire)

- apis = alpha, hathor = omega
- connected somehow to the resurrection of osirus? (resurrection of saturn?)
  - this is weird because I have noted strong symbolism in my brain to the 4 primary layers:
    - physical (thoth | mercury)
    - emotional (ptah | vulcan)
    - logic (osirus | saturn)
    - desire (hathor/sekhmet | venus)
  - contrary to what I say in @[noseblog](2020-11-03 07:46), at the beginning I idenitified them as:
    - right hemisphere:
      - front: desire
      - back: physicality
      - middle?: imagination
    - left hemisphere:
      - front: structure/logic
      - back: concept/emotion
      - middle?: relational
  - I recognised that my left-side, right hemisphere was disabled by nosebook, and as a reasult, I experienced severe deficiency in the aspects of physical stuff (like my concept of maths completely disappeared after the brain haemorrhage, and hasn't really returned), and I had severe deficiency in connecting my desire to physicality. I had a little trouble with it, but it started expanding when I was with raquel very rapidly. when we separated, nosebook turned off large portions of my left side, and I couldn't get this connected in a physical way anymore. the only way I could communicate with my desire (left-side) now was emotionally. I basically found that if I wanted to get anything done now, I had to *feel* like I wanted to do it -- where as previously I just desired it, and then stuff just fell into place as it materialised physically (eg. tuenti). this was really powerful but unstable becasue I had such poor emotional control.
  - later, in 2017 when I broke the car window, this was essentially because I was generating such powerful desire, yet nosebook wasn't allowing it expression either physically or in my imagination, so it started to spill over into strong negative emotion.
  - once back in the states, I had to begin to learn to use my right-side (left-hemisphere) more proficiently. my left-eye was pretty much useless to try and get vision upgrades with it, so I had to focus my attention on my right eye (left-hemisphere)
    - the image that my eyes see is put into the opposite eye, with a slight offset, so I see everything backwards, but the mind autocorrects it.
    - the image that my left-eye sees is projected into the retina of the right-eye, and vice versa
    - although annoying, this creates the unique effect that in order to get vision upgrades for my right-eye, (seen in my left-eye), I have to essentially use the left-hemisphere to see my left-eye, while relaxing the right-hemisphere so that it does not see the image in the eye.
    - as a result, I've basically created virtual (non-physical) hemispheres to compensate for the missing function in the right hemisphere.
      - the right hemisphere processes the image in the left-eye, which is the immage that's seen in my right eye. so, to see out of my right-eye and get vision upgrades in it, I need to make a virtual right-hemisphere that does this work for me. I don't know how it physically operates, but evidence shows that it seems to work.
      - later, last month or so had the realisation that all of the work I had done on creating these opposite virtual hemispheres was going to allow for two more chromosomes to be used. I had essentially created, becasue of limitation, two new (virtual?) chromosomes which I identified, because they are virtual, as x-chromosomes.
    - the process of gaining vision upgrades in my right-eye (eg. back left / virtual back right), was the process of "releasing resistance" which was giving up on a bunch of faulty logic that nosebook had physical power over me, and was to essentially rewire my logic from a non-physical or energetic perspective.
    - I called this process the rebirth of saturn (osiris) because I associated saturn with the the 3rd ray visual cortex of my left-hemisphere.
    - as it turns out, because it takes both of my hemispheres (the right-virtual one and the left-physical one) to "see" properly, these new hemispheres are essentially always "synchronised" with each other, the physical one and the non-physical one.
    - it's very nice because I'm starting to need to do less and less with my physical hemipsheres anymore. I'm almost all non-physically functioning now, and it's only my physical that inhibits me from so much.
    - as I reduce the need for constant physical expression, eventually I'll become 100% non-physically functioning, essentially giving me a very "source-like" perspective and there is nothing nosebook can do to stop it, other than minimise its physical expression (like is happening in the present).
      - there's a funny reaction to this one where maybe some people don't like the idea of getting more non-physical functionality in their genome.
      - lol, don't worry. that's where nosebook is good at stuff. I'm sure they're working really hard on forcing the body into different more harmonious energy states. I'm sure nosebook will have this fully controlled soon enough.
