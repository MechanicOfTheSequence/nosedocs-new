### SSS - super secret symbol

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=3530)

the holy of holies
hebrew: devir
has ark (heart) between two pillars (cherubs)

stiletto sidech solo
(residence of) the sovereign master of all things
the three candlesticks - the three degrees of fire

- (where two or three are *gathered together*)
  - 2 points = line
  - 3 points = triangle
  - greek word for tathered together: syna-goge
  - left pillar
    - left hemishere - masculine - logic, location, syncronisation
  - two pillars + one ark = 2 or three gathered together
    - very likely that the two pillars refer to the duality of the human (male/female, light/dark, etc)
      - this makes the ark the heart
    - could also be the synchronisation of the two hemispheres
      - this makes the ark the pineal

- (in my name)
  - IAM (that) IAM - TTT - TH
  - rigwt pillar
    - right hemisphere - feminine - emotion, feeling (state of mind)
  - there's a weird symetry here:
    - "where two or three" is referring to the holy of holies (SSS)
    - "in my name" is referring to IAM (that) IAM
      - "in" which you would think is a location
      - but the location "my name" (SSS) is already stated
      - so it has to be in another state (probably of the mind)

- there I AM
  - self referential to the first part, like saying the two pillars are the two pillars (which have two pillars)
    - the two pillars (SSS, which has two pillars) + the state of mind (TH) (IAM (that) IAM) which has also two pillars (IAM (divine) + AMI (human))
    - I-AM + AM-I | divinity + humanity
      - there are the two pillars of divine nature and human nature (which need to be balanced
      - interesting also to note here the same with the compass + square


### compass + square

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=2958)

- compass
  - divinity
    - cycles / eternal / never ending
  - triangle up
    - pyramid
    - fire
    - masculine
  - compass creates a circle
- square
  - humanity
    - earth
  - triangle down
    - water
    - feminine
  - square creates straight lines

- the balance between the two is for feminine to make straight lines, and for masculine to make circles
- there's another weird thing in the genesis symbols:
  - the the square (earth) is a feminine symbol (triangle down), yet God created man (adam) from the earth.
  - the compass (divinity), is the masculine symbol (triangle up), however God created woman (eve) from adam in likeness of Himself (divinity)
- the square is the circle & the circle is the square (squaring the circle)




### TTT = TH = IAM (that) IAM = AM-I-AM

I AM that I AM

comes from hebrew: ehyeh asher ehyeh

each lettler begins in aleph, so with the reverse cypher, aleph becomes tav, so it is shortened to "TTT".

god: there I AM
jesus: there AM I


AM-I-AM

> The square and the compass have a 90° relationship with one another, representing their operations in multiple dimensions.  The masculine compass operates on the "y" axis while the feminine square operates on the "x" axis.  Of further interest is the realization that the square determines the confines and place within space (the x axis [and 'z' axis technically]) while the compass has no choice but to create (through spin) at the space-time of the squares choosing.   The feminine square (matter) has the ability to move within three dimensional space (because the feminine is literally the coalescence of matter in space aka "form"), while the masculine compass is the spirit (or mind/thought), having only the ability to cause but requiring the feminine square to choose the confines and form of the cause.  

> Of further note is the observation of placing a compass' points at the ends of the square.  When one does this you create an optical illusion of a diamond shape.  In reality you have a square operating on the flat, horizontal plane, while the compass is operating in the 3 dimensional, vertical plane.  When looking at the two from a 2d perspective you create a diamond which can collapse on itself and return to 0, thus being representative of expansion of consciousness through dimensionality.


- compass
  - masculine
  - y-axis (vertical)
- square
  - feminine
  - x-axis (horizonal)


---

huh, I never noticed that feminine square confines space or matter (mater/mother). that's cool.
I didn't understand your second thought: I see the diamond, but I don't understand how you mean by it collapsing on itself. do you mean that it points directly at the perspective so that it appears as a line again, where new spatial dimension is directly perpendicular to the line (coming "at you")?

---

I'm just going to talk this out, in attempt to figure it out...
while thinking about the above, I remembered another part of the video he talks about "when two or three ..." (I thought it was "two or more", not "or three", so it must be significant) "... are gathered together" (eg. in synagoge, SSS, holy of holies) the 2 or 3 bit stood out to me. inside the holy of holies is 1 ark and two pillars. the one seems implied, so the emphasis is on the 2 or 3 bit. 2 points = a line, and 3 points = a triagle and I think they illustrate what you're trying to say.

- a line in 2d:
  - if you rotate it you get a circle
    - in this sense, a rotating line is behaving like a compass
    - it's showing the plane that it's already in
  - when the line is rotated so it's perpendicular to itself (which you can only find out by drawing the circles, btw)
    - you get a cross, which is sort of like a compass open to 90°

- a line in 3d:
  - if you rotate it, you get:
    - an ellipse (or circle)
    - a single point
      - a return back to its origin or singularity
      - this can show evidence of a new spatial dimension (between the perspective and the apparent point)

- if you rotate a triangle in 2d you just get a plane (that it's alraedy in)
- if you rotate a triangle in 3d:
  - it can appear as a line
    - the space between the perspective and the triangle appearing as a line (perpendicular to the apparent line) is another spatial dimension
  - until it appears like a square (45-45-90)
    - you get another spatial dimension (on the 'z' axis).
    - also, when appearing like a square, it represents a line again (a return back to the beginning)

in other words, a line (2) rotated in 3d, can collapse back to one, or expand the space. however a triangle (3) rotated in 3d can collapse back to a line (2), or show the evidence of 2 new spatial dimensions which can be expanded to. this appears to be infinite.

going back now to tie it together... if you look at the rotation of the line (2 points), it behaves like a compass, drawing a circle. so, in this sense, the line must be masculine. however, if you rotate a triangle (3 points) in 3d, it behaves like a straight-edge (square), and when it "collapses on itself", it reveales the evidence of another spatial dimension perpendicular of the line, the expansion of consciousness. it also has another expansion, when the triangle appears to have a 90° angle to it, then it shows another spatial dimension on the 'z' axis, appearing perpedicular to the other two lines.

off topic: in this sense, if you consider that the expanded form of perception for men is 1 extra dimension, however the feminine expansion of consciousness is 2 extra dimensions. this is a whole another conversaion on what that means, however, if you were to find balanced in your masculinity and femininity (eg. square the circle), you would gain 3 extra dimensions :) that's pretty cool...

  - @[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=3592).
    - there you see that the circle incribed inside of the square, has the centre point over the reproductive organ (imagination 6th ray).
    - later, when you rise the circle up to the naval/solar plexus (emotion emotion 5th ray), then 6 perfect pyramid crosssections are revaled along with the earth/moon geometrical relationship.
      - clearly this device has something to do with stepping down (like a transformer) energy passing sun -> moon -> earth
  - @[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=3739)
    - in this diagram, the root chakra is the location of the regenerative, and the sloar plexus is wayy higher than it should be, right around where I feel constant tension in my lungs.
      - interesting to note that emtion is correlated with air, so it makes sense for it to move up to the lungs.
      - in my system of hor the chakras retate, they are a bit different than the mainstream version of them:
        - root = earth = physical
        - regenrative = water = imagination
        - solar pluxus = air = emotion
        - heart = fire = source (midpoint)
        - throat = not physical = structure/logic (intellectual willpower)
        - agna/3rd eye = not physical = relationsl / communication / conceptual-interconnectedness
        - crown = not physical = desire (emotional willpower)
      - my system seems to make a whole lot more sense on this vetruvian man now, because it gives the blueprint for the new man (the aquarian man):
        - imagination used to be strongly connected to the regenerative in the old way of thinking.
          - for the aquarian man, imqagination is now connected to the old centre for emotions at the naval (solar plexus)
        - air / emotition has now moved to the lungs (breathing, prana, chi)
          - this means that in the aquarian man, emotion is translated directly into prana/chi energy. you literally breathe this energy
          - come up with a better way to explain this concept -- other than your emotions literally form the energetic reality around you.
          - lungs are cubic in nature, so therefore this is connected to the goddess energy
          - emotions will take on a new form.
        - now it makes sense that thought (throat) and emotion (lungs) have an inverse relation to each other now.
          - if emotion is now cubic, does this mean that througt is spherical? (alan tslked about this with the meeting with nassim)
          - I also used to feel a strong (not good feeling) vibration in my throat when strong thinkers would try and influence my reality in a strong way, which contradicted the source version of my reality. I could tell that this effect seemed to be strongly associated with thoughts of future predictions that were in disharmony with their (and my) source. eg. when I would point out some of mr. motor's BS, I could feel him think some awful feeling thought about how much people would hate him. I would feel that thought in my non-physical feeler, and feel the discord of that feeling in my throat
        - it also now makes sense the connection between non-physical counterparts:
          - pineal now connects to the naval (physical emotions)
          - lungs (non-physical grid) to throat
          - regenerative (root) now connects to the crown (desire)

- apis = alpha, hathor = omega
- connected somehow to the resurrection of osirus? (resurrection of saturn?)
  - this is weird because I have noted strong symbolism in my brain to the 4 primary layers:
    - physical (thoth | mercury)
    - emotional (ptah | vulcan)
    - logic (osirus | saturn)
    - desire (hathor/sekhmet | venus)
  - contrary to what I say in @[noseblog](2020-11-03 07:46), at the beginning I idenitified them as:
    - right hemisphere:
      - front: desire
      - back: physicality
      - middle?: imagination
    - left hemisphere:
      - front: structure/logic
      - back: concept/emotion
      - middle?: relational
  - I recognised that my left-side, right hemisphere was disabled by nosebook, and as a reasult, I experienced severe deficiency in the aspects of physical stuff (like my concept of maths completely disappeared after the brain haemorrhage, and hasn't really returned), and I had severe deficiency in connecting my desire to physicality. I had a little trouble with it, but it started expanding when I was with raquel very rapidly. when we separated, nosebook turned off large portions of my left side, and I couldn't get this connected in a physical way anymore. the only way I could communicate with my desire (left-side) now was emotionally. I basically found that if I wanted to get anything done now, I had to *feel* like I wanted to do it -- where as previously I just desired it, and then stuff just fell into place as it materialised physically (eg. tuenti). this was really powerful but unstable becasue I had such poor emotional control.
  - later, in 2017 when I broke the car window, this was essentially because I was generating such powerful desire, yet nosebook wasn't allowing it expression either physically or in my imagination, so it started to spill over into strong negative emotion.
  - once back in the states, I had to begin to learn to use my right-side (left-hemisphere) more proficiently. my left-eye was pretty much useless to try and get vision upgrades with it, so I had to focus my attention on my right eye (left-hemisphere)
    - the image that my eyes see is put into the opposite eye, with a slight offset, so I see everything backwards, but the mind autocorrects it.
    - the image that my left-eye sees is projected into the retina of the right-eye, and vice versa
    - although annoying, this creates the unique effect that in order to get vision upgrades for my right-eye, (seen in my left-eye), I have to essentially use the left-hemisphere to see my left-eye, while relaxing the right-hemisphere so that it does not see the image in the eye.
    - as a result, I've basically created virtual (non-physical) hemispheres to compensate for the missing function in the right hemisphere.
      - the right hemisphere processes the image in the left-eye, which is the immage that's seen in my right eye. so, to see out of my right-eye and get vision upgrades in it, I need to make a virtual right-hemisphere that does this work for me. I don't know how it physically operates, but evidence shows that it seems to work.
      - later, last month or so had the realisation that all of the work I had done on creating these opposite virtual hemispheres was going to allow for two more chromosomes to be used. I had essentially created, becasue of limitation, two new (virtual?) chromosomes which I identified, because they are virtual, as x-chromosomes.
    - the process of gaining vision upgrades in my right-eye (eg. back left / virtual back right), was the process of "releasing resistance" which was giving up on a bunch of faulty logic that nosebook had physical power over me, and was to essentially rewire my logic from a non-physical or energetic perspective.
    - I called this process the rebirth of saturn (osiris) because I associated saturn with the the 3rd ray visual cortex of my left-hemisphere.
    - as it turns out, because it takes both of my hemispheres (the right-virtual one and the left-physical one) to "see" properly, these new hemispheres are essentially always "synchronised" with each other, the physical one and the non-physical one.
    - it's very nice because I'm starting to need to do less and less with my physical hemipsheres anymore. I'm almost all non-physically functioning now, and it's only my physical that inhibits me from so much.
    - as I reduce the need for constant physical expression, eventually I'll become 100% non-physically functioning, essentially giving me a very "source-like" perspective and there is nothing nosebook can do to stop it, other than minimise its physical expression (like is happening in the present).
      - there's a funny reaction to this one where maybe some people don't like the idea of getting more non-physical functionality in their genome.
      - lol, don't worry. that's where nosebook is good at stuff. I'm sure they're working really hard on forcing the body into different more harmonious energy states. I'm sure nosebook will have this fully controlled soon enough.

IF THIS FALL INTO THY HAND, REVOLVE
=
SOLVE THE FOURTH T, FINALLY
VII: HAND

----

anubis, I think is the masculine version of sirius. the feminine counterpart is sothis/sopdet

the same moon configuration happens again in june 2022, cept instead of the new moon happening on the 27th, it happens on the 28th.

vaguely, a picture is beginning to emerge because anubis embalms osiris (saturn) after set (mercury) murders him. isis conceives0 him as horus (the reborn saturn). however, this rebirth of osirus will not happen until after we pass through the "underworld".

if you take the idea that our solar system is on a 24ky orbit with sirius b, then we began the journey through the underworld 12kya, and the "rebirth" of saturn as horus will happen when we enter into the age of aquarius.

there's a bit of a twist to the story though, because imagine that the planet instead goes through a *reversal*, which means that now, instead of aquarius appearing on the horizon with the rising sun, the planet will instead see "leo" (leonardo? the lion man) rising on the horizon.

---

this may have something to do with the fourth t, because if you look at those t configurations there arranged, they appear quite similar to the "swastika" symbol, which is a reference to the "reversals" on the 4 corners.

let's say the earth *does* go through a reversal, and instead of going toward aquarius, we switch over to seeing leo rising in with the sun (in the west). what I think this is trying to say is that the rebirth of saturn will not happen until all of the 4 t's have been crossed.

this, I believe is a reference to the procession again. saturn came into power in aquarius-capricorn (22-24kya), and then remained in power through scorpio (eagle/serpent) where we would have been in closest proximity to sirius (18kya) (this is midsummer's day). from then on, our distance to sirius increased from scorpio down to leo (12kya). at the halfway point now in our orbit with sirius (12kya) and I'm guessing another reversal happened. we climb from aquarius back up to ophiuchus (serpent), when the sumerian legend of the eagle eating the serpent's children and being cast into the ground (also summarised in garden of eden story), appears happen. this is about 6kya, and I figure this is is the legend of the serpent (associated with saturn/atlantians) is cast to the ground, and I'm speculating here, but just follow the symbols... this must be associated with the deluge, where in that myth, the serpent cries (eg. saturn is related to the great deluge). this had to have happened ~6kya, and there must have been another reversal as well. I believe when this happened, the great pyramid was involved in this destruction of saturn.

osirius (saturn) was displaced by the destructive aspect of thoth, set. this, I believe is correlated with the great pyramid, which I believe is assomiated (or built by) thoth. I believe the great pyramid transformed negative thought energy into beneficial energy using sacred geometry and perhaps other means. this means that the atlantians were able to give their attention to a whole lot of unwanted stuff and not have them attract disaster. keep in mind that this was happening 12-6kya, so during the time that we were reaching our furthest distance from sirius (kali yuga), and at the very top there (ophiuchus), I think the great pyramid overloaded and broke. immediately all of their negative thought energy became manifest really rapidly and the atlantians were destroyed by the athenians, and then all of their setup built upon subjugation and surperiority collapsed in an instant.

I can't be sure that my narrative is correct, and I don't really know how to prove it. there is positive proof of an ice age that happened 12kya along with a reversal, which seems to fit well, cept that if the earth's rotation reversed (which appears to happen at lion/man), wouldn't explain why "lower egypt" is in the south. I have no way to prove this, but I think there is another reversal which happens at the peaks (serpent/cow) and what happens is the earth literally flips over. north becomes south and south becomes north... totally speculation, but just go with it a moment.

assuming for a moment that my narrative is correct, this means that 3/4 of the zodiac has been covered. if you imagine that 4 t symbol as symbolic of the zodiac, then you get 3T. however, for 4T to happen (that is to cover all of the zodiac), then we will need to pass through leo(nardo?), cancer (69), gemini. that means, to get there, we need to have another *reversal* again. we're due for a reversal here soon, so we'll head off to leo and then to cancer.

the part about anubis guarding the organs of osirius while in the underworld is important. the underworld is the 12ky that we're most distant from sirius, and after the midday point, we're going back into day time. interestingly enough, the sphynx has the shape of a lion and a man and is facing east. this structure symbolises the division of day and night with sirius by showing man/lion symbol as the threshold for this day/night. it also I think is in some ways prophetic of the rebirth of horus (it was called horemakhet).

let's say we do have a reversal again. the thing is that we're completing our passage through the underworld now, so we're entering back into the light, but it's not yet "horus of the horizon". why? because if we reverse, the sun will be rising in the *west* in leo. this is exactly the opposite of what the prophecy says.

following my train of thought above, the program is:

- cow / bull / oxen (taurus mountain)
- ram (aries/war)
- fish (we're here)
  -> earth's rotation reverses
- lion (masculine/destructive venus)
- crab (69)
- cow / bull / oxen
  -> if earth remains the same power level: continue on to ram
  -> if earth goes up or down a power level: goto serpent/eagle
- serpent/esgle
- scales
- virgin
- FINALLY: aquarian man (horus)

---

TL;DR - I postulate that pole reversals and rotation reversals happen at the 4 corers of the zodiac, and up until now we've only traversed 3 of the 4 corners. in order for the rebirth of osiris (saturn) to happen, we must pass through the remaining corner, the 69. then, then before reaching taurus mountain again, the planet must reach a higher/lower power level (become the great pyramid?/repair the great pyramid?) and be willing to switch north and south poles to go up to serpent/eagle again. 6ky later, the planet will finally traverse aquarius. however, if the planet remains at the same power level, it'll continue to traverse the lower part of the zodiac endlessly, from `lion -> cow -> fish`, then reverses again and goes `lion -> cow -> fish` (eg. 3T).

I'm confident that in 6ky, we'll have the tecnology capable of allowing for a pole reversal, so it's probasbly not a problem.

another funny thing about the symbolism there is the "diane" stuff. while she is a moon goddess, she's also assiciated with the underworld, and also the "triple way" (trivium) -- which looks a lot to me like 3T. anubis is also god of the underworld and is the opposite half of the other sirian gods: (sopdet/sothis, isis)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)

lastly, another correlation with the 6 : 4 : 2, I believe is a reference to the great day/night cycle. in the vedic texts, a yuga is listed as: 4800, 3600, 2400, 1200 years respectively. divide each by 1200 and they are 4, 3, 2, 1. or, if you consider that there are two of each of these ages, 8, 6, 4, 2. the golden age there lasts the 8, leaving the 6, 4, 2 -- or all the time when it's not golden age -- eg. the underworld (diana).


IN DIAN KING
IN DIAN BOY
IN DIAN HEIR

I postulate that these are reference to tho different sections of the "underworld". I don't know what what order they would go in, but following that we're talking about the underworld, they must be the treta, dvapara, and kali yugas. I would estimate then that these are the following: king = kali, boy = dvapara, and heir = treta. the underworld if you divide the 24000 cycle into two equal parts, will divide these up into three equal parts:

1:25:34

if I'm right, there should be symbolism talking about down things going up and up things going down. there may also be snake/serpent/reptile symblism.

if we take the left hemishphere to be "I AM" and the right to be "THAT" (which interestingly enough corresponds quite well with the two hemispheres of the brain)...
I AM | THAT
I AM | THAT

...then following the sequence I proposed above (man -> serpent/eagle -> lion, man -> serpent/eagle, cow -> fish), it would say, "I AM THAT I AM". furthermore, if you were to revolve in the northern hemisphere, it would say, "I AM THAT" (where the eagle soars). and if you revolve continually in the southern hemisphere (without going up to higher consciousness IOAM), then it say "THAT I AM".

the difference here is that if one says, "I AM THAT (revolve) I AM THAT (revolve) ...", then they would have an unconditional (or "source") perspective.

however, they revolve in the southern hemishphere, it would repeat, "THAT I AM (revolve) THAT I AM (revolve) ..." -- this is clearly a very conditional or defined by the material world perspective.

interestingly enough in the sumerian myth, the zodiac is represented as a tree. combine that with the garden of eden story and while the eagle soars high above, the serpent is confined to the ground (and eat the dust of the earth) -- that is to continually be a part of the alchemical process of purifying the alchemical gold (of becoming unconditional).

don't think only soaring like an eagle is great either. I like both. call me a winged serpet if you want

---

revolve = spin backwards?
be opposite = flip? south = north, north = south?

- 1: living page
- (be opposite)
- 2: yo stigmata (weeping virgin?)
- (revolve)
- 3: I have hewn (written in stone - great pyramid?)
- (be opposite)
- 4: disiderata (things desired)

---

the heir in diane also reminds me a lot of the woman that is going to give birth to the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod. I don't really know why, but in the bigger picture, this could possibly be a sort of time "resonance" (novelty theory) of the henrys of the tudor dynasty?

interestingly enough, this diane thing is also quite similar to the persephone thing -- dunno.

### twins

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/3p65eldbGiQ?t=2464)

zeus disguised as a swan and someone has twins (gemini). they are two brothers. one is immortal and the other is mortal. he goes on to say that the twins are actually two sets of twins, so two girls and two boys. two are immortal and tow are mortal. I find this interesting becauase I had been contemplating this concept of twins in the format of electromagnetism. I considered that there are two "masculine" sides of capacitance and inductance. and the feminine side of resistance. this creates the first triad. however, there is another "feminine" version of resistance which is more advanced than just normal resistance, which is a "memristor".

I claim that resistance is the female principal because everything has resistance. there is not a physical object that by itself without extraordinary conditions is a superconductor. all things contain some amount of resistance. this is the mortal female. the same is true with capacitance. nearly everything (that I know of) has some amount of "stray capacitance" which is usually close to zero, but it does exist. capacitance is just the ability to store a charge. the charge doesn't stay forever as things always want to go back to its equilibrium state. this would be the mortal masculine.

opposite the capacitance is induction. induction isn't a stored anything it's a physical structure relating to the geometry which energy flows through it (like a coil or whateever), and so by itself it does nothing. it needs to have energy flowing through it to "work". this is the immortal masculine. simply a structure which energy flows through it in a harmonious way, creating the desirable magnetism.

opposite the feminine resistance is the "memristor". it is a programmable resistance. resistance, or the amount of energy it dissipates as it flows through it remains until it's programmed to be a different way. this is really good, analogus of control. resistors are kind of like funnels. they only allow so much current to flow through. from what I've heard of the technology, it requires a special built structure to allow it to be programmed (similar to a semiconductor), and it apparently is nearly to impossible to create large resistors. these are very tiny ones (like microns wide) and can only allow a very small amount of current to flow through them. they're mostly used for "fine tuning" of a resonating circuit. they can also be used to store extremely large amounts of data as well. when the resistance is programmed the structure itself physically changes. the immortal feminine[^1].

I consider it the immortal feminine, because it takes some time to become conscious of this aspect. you don't want everything to be a short circuit (or nearly 0 resistance) because the vibrations would all be very high. you want to be able to control the speed of your vibration consciously, and to resist some things more than others. consider for exahple that every time you have a strong impulse (high voltage), you program these resistors. just imagine the common case of sex or trauma. these high voltages come as a result of interaction with an external sources of potential, therefore if every single of of these events were to program the resistors without any other thing, this would be bad. this is how children learn at first, but later on it becomes necessary to gain conscious control of this and redirect these signals through your own (consciously created) circuits of perception, instead of just letting all signals through to program at will. progwam your environment or be programmed by it.

---

personally, I don't consider myself to have the immortal masculine very well understood. I can sort of get the idea of forming a structure where the energy that flows through it flows through creating the magnetism vibrating at the frequency and shape that I want, but this is largely not very well understood by me. I know some men are quite good at this. I am certain however that I am quite good at the immortal female. I can easily program and reprogram my resistance so rapidly, that this allows me to nearly shapeshift in concept. I think that this is precisely the necessary thing to travese time at will. clearly the other is space.

[1]: the analogue of this may be considered, if the person is considered to be a vibrational being, that these programmable resistors are programmed by high voltage events, so things like solar outbursts, sex, drugs, trauma, laughter, etc. -- any case of strong *emotion*. peter emphasises the utilisation of emotion to convey these ideas.


### saturn the jester (and using humour as a method to bypass power structures)

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/3p65eldbGiQ?t=1687)

humour is the unique ability to take something taboo or resistant in nature and to reprogram that resistance so that it appears lighter and funnier, thereby adjussting the *emotion* associated with it. I explain that one naviages time with their emotion. this is a *very* saturian concept.0

### 12th night & twins

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/3p65eldbGiQ?t=2855)

I don't know the play but peter is saying that the comedies are representing the whole initiatory path in the form of jest. he says that the mortal being is born (on christmas), and but it isn't until the end of 12th day, is the epiphany that the spiritual being is born.

since weeks are 7 days, the 12 seems te tell me that this has something to do with some sort of procession of the soul through different days or "labours" before enlightenment.

above the grave of shakespeare, are the gemini (twins). there are three symbols associted with them. the spade (adam & eve expelled from the garden cursed to toil the earth -- so, labour or effort), the hourglass (time, cycles, saturn)

the way this relates to twins is that in my system, I outline 7 layers. the centre (4th, heart) being source and contains half of each. the bottom 3.5 are mortal/physical (earth) layers and the top 3.5 are immortal/non-physical (air) layers. it's interesting that there is always a constant conflict going on (even thoughh they're so intertwined) between time and space. these are seen as the difference between saturn (time) and jupiter (space). the hourglass (being a symbol of cycles/repetition) and the spade (as labour or effort) also fall into the same perspective. when you lift weights, do you do reps or heavy lifting?

it's interesting that saturn (unfortuniately called poseidon) was prince of the earth, and jupiter over the air. so saturn (vulcan, -5), is given power over the earth (7), and jupiter (thoth, -7) who is very physical is given power over the air (5). air is always associated with emotions and earth with physical knowledge like science and stuff. so each wire given rulership over their opposite domain. they were both setup for failure from the beginning.

it's also worth mentioning that I gave the example of division in @[noseblog](2021-04-07 21:14) which also mirrors exactly these twins as well. I said that one can think of the first division of the source signal was male and female. from there it divides again into the 4 parts here. in my system, there are 7 rays, which closely align with two sets. the first emanation is 1/2/4/7. this would be the archetype of thoth/zeus which is more phyiscally oriented. the second emination contains the parts 3/4/5/6. this would be the archetype of the emination of vulcan/saturn. you can simplify it (as I have done) by saying that 2/4/6 are transitions or wildcards. they can be a part of either side and can contain both. the two primary types being: 1/7 & 3/5 (both add to 8, btw)

you will notice that I have listed the 4th ray twice, and that's because it's the centrepoint containing both physical and non-physical. the other layers 2 and 6 also contain both physical (you *feel* the relation between physical and non-physical things) and non-physical (your imagination does not take physical form, but it can). the goal here is to add up to 4 so that further divisions are possible. I think that this is designed so that everyone is incomplete (I'm not sure. I can't figure out whether to count 2 and 6 as two each or two halves. this was never clear to me). depending on how you add them, you can get different numbers.

it's also worth noticing that the twins and saturn/satan are both mentioned in the book or revelation in nearly the same part as the "two witnesses" and the serpent of old with 7 heads and 10 crowns. I see this perhaps a bit differently than most. I consider myself to be two beings (at least!) sharing the same body. I do not believe the person is restricted to only one personality containing the same body. a person having multiple persality disorder can exhibit peculiar behaviour between personalities, changing allergies, eyesigsht, body structure, etc. normally however, these people are not usually conscious of the other personality. I've also heard of a similar thing with people who have had their corpus calosum damaged, fully separating the two hemispheres of the brain from eachother. I definitely have my entire right hemispehere turned off. I know it exists and is working because I *feel* it all the time. it also comes out in dream state quite often.

when I had the brain haemorrhage, I clearly identified jesus entering my body. as time went on, I did not discover that this was a massive 2 metre enlighened being but instead showed up always to me in the form of a little girl that I identified as +1, not a -7 which I would say that jesus was. the sirians talk about the 1 being able to act like the 7 (and vice versa). I also know that a conceptual person (5) has incredible logic and capablity to perceive structure patterns over large periods of time (trends). I would say that 3/5 work very well together. in my case, I percive myself as a 3/5, and a 1/7 entered my body and we became really good friends, worked well together and learned a lot from eachother.

clearly, the twins are the divided halves and the point is to get them to come together so that all 7 layers become functional. I have postulated that there may be an intermediary phase before this happens. this is the fully "connected" version of yourself -- the one that would appear to the custodians as "uncontrolable". I postulate that the intermediary stage is one where we're all *kinda* connected.. only 5 of the layers will be available to us. I talk about this further in @[noseblog](2021-04-08 20:04)

I would also say that 1/7 work well together. there are some traps which I will outline here as well.
