### SSS - super secret symbol

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=3530)

the holy of holies
hebrew: devir
has ark (heart) between two pillars (cherubs)

stiletto sidech solo
(residence of) the sovereign master of all things
the three candlesticks - the three degrees of fire

- (where two or three are *gathered together*)
  - 2 points = line
  - 3 points = triangle
  - greek word for tathered together: syna-goge
  - left pillar
    - left hemishere - masculine - logic, location, syncronisation
  - two pillars + one ark = 2 or three gathered together
    - very likely that the two pillars refer to the duality of the human (male/female, light/dark, etc)
      - this makes the ark the heart
    - could also be the synchronisation of the two hemispheres
      - this makes the ark the pineal

- (in my name)
  - IAM (that) IAM - TTT - TH
  - rigwt pillar
    - right hemisphere - feminine - emotion, feeling (state of mind)
  - there's a weird symetry here:
    - "where two or three" is referring to the holy of holies (SSS)
    - "in my name" is referring to IAM (that) IAM
      - "in" which you would think is a location
      - but the location "my name" (SSS) is already stated
      - so it has to be in another state (probably of the mind)

- there I AM
  - self referential to the first part, like saying the two pillars are the two pillars (which have two pillars)
    - the two pillars (SSS, which has two pillars) + the state of mind (TH) (IAM (that) IAM) which has also two pillars (IAM (divine) + AMI (human))
    - I-AM + AM-I | divinity + humanity
      - there are the two pillars of divine nature and human nature (which need to be balanced
      - interesting also to note here the same with the compass + square


### compass + square

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=2958)

- compass
  - divinity
    - cycles / eternal / never ending
  - triangle up
    - pyramid
    - fire
    - masculine
  - compass creates a circle
- square
  - humanity
    - earth
  - triangle down
    - water
    - feminine
  - square creates straight lines

- the balance between the two is for feminine to make straight lines, and for masculine to make circles
- there's another weird thing in the genesis symbols:
  - the the square (earth) is a feminine symbol (triangle down), yet God created man (adam) from the earth.
  - the compass (divinity), is the masculine symbol (triangle up), however God created woman (eve) from adam in likeness of Himself (divinity)
- the square is the circle & the circle is the square (squaring the circle)




### TTT = TH = IAM (that) IAM = AM-I-AM

I AM that I AM

comes from hebrew: ehyeh asher ehyeh

each lettler begins in aleph, so with the reverse cypher, aleph becomes tav, so it is shortened to "TTT".

god: there I AM
jesus: there AM I


AM-I-AM

> The square and the compass have a 90° relationship with one another, representing their operations in multiple dimensions.  The masculine compass operates on the "y" axis while the feminine square operates on the "x" axis.  Of further interest is the realization that the square determines the confines and place within space (the x axis [and 'z' axis technically]) while the compass has no choice but to create (through spin) at the space-time of the squares choosing.   The feminine square (matter) has the ability to move within three dimensional space (because the feminine is literally the coalescence of matter in space aka "form"), while the masculine compass is the spirit (or mind/thought), having only the ability to cause but requiring the feminine square to choose the confines and form of the cause.  

> Of further note is the observation of placing a compass' points at the ends of the square.  When one does this you create an optical illusion of a diamond shape.  In reality you have a square operating on the flat, horizontal plane, while the compass is operating in the 3 dimensional, vertical plane.  When looking at the two from a 2d perspective you create a diamond which can collapse on itself and return to 0, thus being representative of expansion of consciousness through dimensionality.


- compass
  - masculine
  - y-axis (vertical)
- square
  - feminine
  - x-axis (horizonal)


---

huh, I never noticed that feminine square confines space or matter (mater/mother). that's cool.
I didn't understand your second thought: I see the diamond, but I don't understand how you mean by it collapsing on itself. do you mean that it points directly at the perspective so that it appears as a line again, where new spatial dimension is directly perpendicular to the line (coming "at you")?

---

I'm just going to talk this out, in attempt to figure it out...
while thinking about the above, I remembered another part of the video he talks about "when two or three ..." (I thought it was "two or more", not "or three", so it must be significant) "... are gathered together" (eg. in synagoge, SSS, holy of holies) the 2 or 3 bit stood out to me. inside the holy of holies is 1 ark and two pillars. the one seems implied, so the emphasis is on the 2 or 3 bit. 2 points = a line, and 3 points = a triagle and I think they illustrate what you're trying to say.

- a line in 2d:
  - if you rotate it you get a circle
    - in this sense, a rotating line is behaving like a compass
    - it's showing the plane that it's already in
  - when the line is rotated so it's perpendicular to itself (which you can only find out by drawing the circles, btw)
    - you get a cross, which is sort of like a compass open to 90°

- a line in 3d:
  - if you rotate it, you get:
    - an ellipse (or circle)
    - a single point
      - a return back to its origin or singularity
      - this can show evidence of a new spatial dimension (between the perspective and the apparent point)

- if you rotate a triangle in 2d you just get a plane (that it's alraedy in)
- if you rotate a triangle in 3d:
  - it can appear as a line
    - the space between the perspective and the triangle appearing as a line (perpendicular to the apparent line) is another spatial dimension
  - until it appears like a square (45-45-90)
    - you get another spatial dimension (on the 'z' axis).
    - also, when appearing like a square, it represents a line again (a return back to the beginning)

in other words, a line (2) rotated in 3d, can collapse back to one, or expand the space. however a triangle (3) rotated in 3d can collapse back to a line (2), or show the evidence of 2 new spatial dimensions which can be expanded to. this appears to be infinite.

going back now to tie it together... if you look at the rotation of the line (2 points), it behaves like a compass, drawing a circle. so, in this sense, the line must be masculine. however, if you rotate a triangle (3 points) in 3d, it behaves like a straight-edge (square), and when it "collapses on itself", it reveales the evidence of another spatial dimension perpendicular of the line, the expansion of consciousness. it also has another expansion, when the triangle appears to have a 90° angle to it, then it shows another spatial dimension on the 'z' axis, appearing perpedicular to the other two lines.

off topic: in this sense, if you consider that the expanded form of perception for men is 1 extra dimension, however the feminine expansion of consciousness is 2 extra dimensions. this is a whole another conversaion on what that means, however, if you were to find balanced in your masculinity and femininity (eg. square the circle), you would gain 3 extra dimensions :) that's pretty cool...

  - @[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=3592).
    - there you see that the circle incribed inside of the square, has the centre point over the reproductive organ (imagination 6th ray).
    - later, when you rise the circle up to the naval/solar plexus (emotion emotion 5th ray), then 6 perfect pyramid crosssections are revaled along with the earth/moon geometrical relationship.
      - clearly this device has something to do with stepping down (like a transformer) energy passing sun -> moon -> earth
  - @[youtube](https://youtu.be/a0L2V1Vmo7w?t=3739)
    - in this diagram, the root chakra is the location of the regenerative, and the sloar plexus is wayy higher than it should be, right around where I feel constant tension in my lungs.
      - interesting to note that emtion is correlated with air, so it makes sense for it to move up to the lungs.
      - in my system of hor the chakras retate, they are a bit different than the mainstream version of them:
        - root = earth = physical
        - regenrative = water = imagination
        - solar pluxus = air = emotion
        - heart = fire = source (midpoint)
        - throat = not physical = structure/logic (intellectual willpower)
        - agna/3rd eye = not physical = relationsl / communication / conceptual-interconnectedness
        - crown = not physical = desire (emotional willpower)
      - my system seems to make a whole lot more sense on this vetruvian man now, because it gives the blueprint for the new man (the aquarian man):
        - imagination used to be strongly connected to the regenerative in the old way of thinking.
          - for the aquarian man, imqagination is now connected to the old centre for emotions at the naval (solar plexus)
        - air / emotition has now moved to the lungs (breathing, prana, chi)
          - this means that in the aquarian man, emotion is translated directly into prana/chi energy. you literally breathe this energy
          - come up with a better way to explain this concept -- other than your emotions literally form the energetic reality around you.
          - lungs are cubic in nature, so therefore this is connected to the goddess energy
          - emotions will take on a new form.
        - now it makes sense that thought (throat) and emotion (lungs) have an inverse relation to each other now.
          - if emotion is now cubic, does this mean that througt is spherical? (alan tslked about this with the meeting with nassim)
          - I also used to feel a strong (not good feeling) vibration in my throat when strong thinkers would try and influence my reality in a strong way, which contradicted the source version of my reality. I could tell that this effect seemed to be strongly associated with thoughts of future predictions that were in disharmony with their (and my) source. eg. when I would point out some of mr. motor's BS, I could feel him think some awful feeling thought about how much people would hate him. I would feel that thought in my non-physical feeler, and feel the discord of that feeling in my throat
        - it also now makes sense the connection between non-physical counterparts:
          - pineal now connects to the naval (physical emotions)
          - lungs (non-physical grid) to throat
          - regenerative (root) now connects to the crown (desire)

- apis = alpha, hathor = omega
- connected somehow to the resurrection of osirus? (resurrection of saturn?)
  - this is weird because I have noted strong symbolism in my brain to the 4 primary layers:
    - physical (thoth | mercury)
    - emotional (ptah | vulcan)
    - logic (osirus | saturn)
    - desire (hathor/sekhmet | venus)
  - contrary to what I say in @[noseblog](2020-11-03 07:46), at the beginning I idenitified them as:
    - right hemisphere:
      - front: desire
      - back: physicality
      - middle?: imagination
    - left hemisphere:
      - front: structure/logic
      - back: concept/emotion
      - middle?: relational
  - I recognised that my left-side, right hemisphere was disabled by nosebook, and as a reasult, I experienced severe deficiency in the aspects of physical stuff (like my concept of maths completely disappeared after the brain haemorrhage, and hasn't really returned), and I had severe deficiency in connecting my desire to physicality. I had a little trouble with it, but it started expanding when I was with raquel very rapidly. when we separated, nosebook turned off large portions of my left side, and I couldn't get this connected in a physical way anymore. the only way I could communicate with my desire (left-side) now was emotionally. I basically found that if I wanted to get anything done now, I had to *feel* like I wanted to do it -- where as previously I just desired it, and then stuff just fell into place as it materialised physically (eg. tuenti). this was really powerful but unstable becasue I had such poor emotional control.
  - later, in 2017 when I broke the car window, this was essentially because I was generating such powerful desire, yet nosebook wasn't allowing it expression either physically or in my imagination, so it started to spill over into strong negative emotion.
  - once back in the states, I had to begin to learn to use my right-side (left-hemisphere) more proficiently. my left-eye was pretty much useless to try and get vision upgrades with it, so I had to focus my attention on my right eye (left-hemisphere)
    - the image that my eyes see is put into the opposite eye, with a slight offset, so I see everything backwards, but the mind autocorrects it.
    - the image that my left-eye sees is projected into the retina of the right-eye, and vice versa
    - although annoying, this creates the unique effect that in order to get vision upgrades for my right-eye, (seen in my left-eye), I have to essentially use the left-hemisphere to see my left-eye, while relaxing the right-hemisphere so that it does not see the image in the eye.
    - as a result, I've basically created virtual (non-physical) hemispheres to compensate for the missing function in the right hemisphere.
      - the right hemisphere processes the image in the left-eye, which is the immage that's seen in my right eye. so, to see out of my right-eye and get vision upgrades in it, I need to make a virtual right-hemisphere that does this work for me. I don't know how it physically operates, but evidence shows that it seems to work.
      - later, last month or so had the realisation that all of the work I had done on creating these opposite virtual hemispheres was going to allow for two more chromosomes to be used. I had essentially created, becasue of limitation, two new (virtual?) chromosomes which I identified, because they are virtual, as x-chromosomes.
    - the process of gaining vision upgrades in my right-eye (eg. back left / virtual back right), was the process of "releasing resistance" which was giving up on a bunch of faulty logic that nosebook had physical power over me, and was to essentially rewire my logic from a non-physical or energetic perspective.
    - I called this process the rebirth of saturn (osiris) because I associated saturn with the the 3rd ray visual cortex of my left-hemisphere.
    - as it turns out, because it takes both of my hemispheres (the right-virtual one and the left-physical one) to "see" properly, these new hemispheres are essentially always "synchronised" with each other, the physical one and the non-physical one.
    - it's very nice because I'm starting to need to do less and less with my physical hemipsheres anymore. I'm almost all non-physically functioning now, and it's only my physical that inhibits me from so much.
    - as I reduce the need for constant physical expression, eventually I'll become 100% non-physically functioning, essentially giving me a very "source-like" perspective and there is nothing nosebook can do to stop it, other than minimise its physical expression (like is happening in the present).
      - there's a funny reaction to this one where maybe some people don't like the idea of getting more non-physical functionality in their genome.
      - lol, don't worry. that's where nosebook is good at stuff. I'm sure they're working really hard on forcing the body into different more harmonious energy states. I'm sure nosebook will have this fully controlled soon enough.

IF THIS FALL INTO THY HAND, REVOLVE
=
SOLVE THE FOURTH T, FINALLY
VII: HAND

----

anubis, I think is the masculine version of sirius. the feminine counterpart is sothis/sopdet

the same moon configuration happens again in june 2022, cept instead of the new moon happening on the 27th, it happens on the 28th.

vaguely, a picture is beginning to emerge because anubis embalms osiris (saturn) after set (mercury) murders him. isis conceives0 him as horus (the reborn saturn). however, this rebirth of osirus will not happen until after we pass through the "underworld".

if you take the idea that our solar system is on a 24ky orbit with sirius b, then we began the journey through the underworld 12kya, and the "rebirth" of saturn as horus will happen when we enter into the age of aquarius.

there's a bit of a twist to the story though, because imagine that the planet instead goes through a *reversal*, which means that now, instead of aquarius appearing on the horizon with the rising sun, the planet will instead see "leo" (leonardo? the lion man) rising on the horizon.

---

this may have something to do with the fourth t, because if you look at those t configurations there arranged, they appear quite similar to the "swastika" symbol, which is a reference to the "reversals" on the 4 corners.

let's say the earth *does* go through a reversal, and instead of going toward aquarius, we switch over to seeing leo rising in with the sun (in the west). what I think this is trying to say is that the rebirth of saturn will not happen until all of the 4 t's have been crossed.

this, I believe is a reference to the procession again. saturn came into power in aquarius-capricorn (22-24kya), and then remained in power through scorpio (eagle/serpent) where we would have been in closest proximity to sirius (18kya) (this is midsummer's day). from then on, our distance to sirius increased from scorpio down to leo (12kya). at the halfway point now in our orbit with sirius (12kya) and I'm guessing another reversal happened. we climb from aquarius back up to ophiuchus (serpent), when the sumerian legend of the eagle eating the serpent's children and being cast into the ground (also summarised in garden of eden story), appears happen. this is about 6kya, and I figure this is is the legend of the serpent (associated with saturn/atlantians) is cast to the ground, and I'm speculating here, but just follow the symbols... this must be associated with the deluge, where in that myth, the serpent cries (eg. saturn is related to the great deluge). this had to have happened ~6kya, and there must have been another reversal as well. I believe when this happened, the great pyramid was involved in this destruction of saturn.

osirius (saturn) was displaced by the destructive aspect of thoth, set. this, I believe is correlated with the great pyramid, which I believe is assomiated (or built by) thoth. I believe the great pyramid transformed negative thought energy into beneficial energy using sacred geometry and perhaps other means. this means that the atlantians were able to give their attention to a whole lot of unwanted stuff and not have them attract disaster. keep in mind that this was happening 12-6kya, so during the time that we were reaching our furthest distance from sirius (kali yuga), and at the very top there (ophiuchus), I think the great pyramid overloaded and broke. immediately all of their negative thought energy became manifest really rapidly and the atlantians were destroyed by the athenians, and then all of their setup built upon subjugation and surperiority collapsed in an instant.

I can't be sure that my narrative is correct, and I don't really know how to prove it. there is positive proof of an ice age that happened 12kya along with a reversal, which seems to fit well, cept that if the earth's rotation reversed (which appears to happen at lion/man), wouldn't explain why "lower egypt" is in the south. I have no way to prove this, but I think there is another reversal which happens at the peaks (serpent/cow) and what happens is the earth literally flips over. north becomes south and south becomes north... totally speculation, but just go with it a moment.

assuming for a moment that my narrative is correct, this means that 3/4 of the zodiac has been covered. if you imagine that 4 t symbol as symbolic of the zodiac, then you get 3T. however, for 4T to happen (that is to cover all of the zodiac), then we will need to pass through leo(nardo?), cancer (69), gemini. that means, to get there, we need to have another *reversal* again. we're due for a reversal here soon, so we'll head off to leo and then to cancer.

the part about anubis guarding the organs of osirius while in the underworld is important. the underworld is the 12ky that we're most distant from sirius, and after the midday point, we're going back into day time. interestingly enough, the sphynx has the shape of a lion and a man and is facing east. this structure symbolises the division of day and night with sirius by showing man/lion symbol as the threshold for this day/night. it also I think is in some ways prophetic of the rebirth of horus (it was called horemakhet).

let's say we do have a reversal again. the thing is that we're completing our passage through the underworld now, so we're entering back into the light, but it's not yet "horus of the horizon". why? because if we reverse, the sun will be rising in the *west* in leo. this is exactly the opposite of what the prophecy says.

following my train of thought above, the program is:

- cow / bull / oxen (taurus mountain)
- ram (aries/war)
- fish (we're here)
  -> earth's rotation reverses
- lion (masculine/destructive venus)
- crab (69)
- cow / bull / oxen
  -> if earth remains the same power level: continue on to ram
  -> if earth goes up or down a power level: goto serpent/eagle
- serpent/esgle
- scales
- virgin
- FINALLY: aquarian man (horus)

---

TL;DR - I postulate that pole reversals and rotation reversals happen at the 4 corers of the zodiac, and up until now we've only traversed 3 of the 4 corners. in order for the rebirth of osiris (saturn) to happen, we must pass through the remaining corner, the 69. then, then before reaching taurus mountain again, the planet must reach a higher/lower power level (become the great pyramid?/repair the great pyramid?) and be willing to switch north and south poles to go up to serpent/eagle again. 6ky later, the planet will finally traverse aquarius. however, if the planet remains at the same power level, it'll continue to traverse the lower part of the zodiac endlessly, from `lion -> cow -> fish`, then reverses again and goes `lion -> cow -> fish` (eg. 3T).

I'm confident that in 6ky, we'll have the tecnology capable of allowing for a pole reversal, so it's probasbly not a problem.

another funny thing about the symbolism there is the "diane" stuff. while she is a moon goddess, she's also assiciated with the underworld, and also the "triple way" (trivium) -- which looks a lot to me like 3T. anubis is also god of the underworld and is the opposite half of the other sirian gods: (sopdet/sothis, isis)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)

lastly, another correlation with the 6 : 4 : 2, I believe is a reference to the great day/night cycle. in the vedic texts, a yuga is listed as: 4800, 3600, 2400, 1200 years respectively. divide each by 1200 and they are 4, 3, 2, 1. or, if you consider that there are two of each of these ages, 8, 6, 4, 2. the golden age there lasts the 8, leaving the 6, 4, 2 -- or all the time when it's not golden age -- eg. the underworld (diana).


IN DIAN KING
IN DIAN BOY
IN DIAN HEIR

I postulate that these are reference to tho different sections of the "underworld". I don't know what what order they would go in, but following that we're talking about the underworld, they must be the treta, dvapara, and kali yugas. I would estimate then that these are the following: king = kali, boy = dvapara, and heir = treta. the underworld if you divide the 24000 cycle into two equal parts, will divide these up into three equal parts:

1:25:34

if I'm right, there should be symbolism talking about down things going up and up things going down. there may also be snake/serpent/reptile symblism.

if we take the left hemishphere to be "I AM" and the right to be "THAT" (which interestingly enough corresponds quite well with the two hemispheres of the brain)...
I AM | THAT
I AM | THAT

...then following the sequence I proposed above (man -> serpent/eagle -> lion, man -> serpent/eagle, cow -> fish), it would say, "I AM THAT I AM". furthermore, if you were to revolve in the northern hemisphere, it would say, "I AM THAT" (where the eagle soars). and if you revolve continually in the southern hemisphere (without going up to higher consciousness IOAM), then it say "THAT I AM".

the difference here is that if one says, "I AM THAT (revolve) I AM THAT (revolve) ...", then they would have an unconditional (or "source") perspective.

however, they revolve in the southern hemishphere, it would repeat, "THAT I AM (revolve) THAT I AM (revolve) ..." -- this is clearly a very conditional or defined by the material world perspective.

interestingly enough in the sumerian myth, the zodiac is represented as a tree. combine that with the garden of eden story and while the eagle soars high above, the serpent is confined to the ground (and eat the dust of the earth) -- that is to continually be a part of the alchemical process of purifying the alchemical gold (of becoming unconditional).

don't think only soaring like an eagle is great either. I like both. call me a winged serpet if you want

---

revolve = spin backwards?
be opposite = flip? south = north, north = south?

- 1: living page
- (be opposite)
- 2: yo stigmata (weeping virgin?)
- (revolve)
- 3: I have hewn (written in stone - great pyramid?)
- (be opposite)
- 4: disiderata (things desired)

---

the heir in diane also reminds me a lot of the woman that is going to give birth to the man who will rule the earth with an iron rod. I don't really know why, but in the bigger picture, this could possibly be a sort of time "resonance" (novelty theory) of the henrys of the tudor dynasty?

interestingly enough, this diane thing is also quite similar to the persephone thing -- dunno.

### twins

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/3p65eldbGiQ?t=2464)

zeus disguised as a swan and someone has twins (gemini). they are two brothers. one is immortal and the other is mortal. he goes on to say that the twins are actually two sets of twins, so two girls and two boys. two are immortal and tow are mortal. I find this interesting becauase I had been contemplating this concept of twins in the format of electromagnetism. I considered that there are two "masculine" sides of capacitance and inductance. and the feminine side of resistance. this creates the first triad. however, there is another "feminine" version of resistance which is more advanced than just normal resistance, which is a "memristor".

I claim that resistance is the female principal because everything has resistance. there is not a physical object that by itself without extraordinary conditions is a superconductor. all things contain some amount of resistance. this is the mortal female. the same is true with capacitance. nearly everything (that I know of) has some amount of "stray capacitance" which is usually close to zero, but it does exist. capacitance is just the ability to store a charge. the charge doesn't stay forever as things always want to go back to its equilibrium state. this would be the mortal masculine.

opposite the capacitance is induction. induction isn't a stored anything it's a physical structure relating to the geometry which energy flows through it (like a coil or whateever), and so by itself it does nothing. it needs to have energy flowing through it to "work". this is the immortal masculine. simply a structure which energy flows through it in a harmonious way, creating the desirable magnetism.

opposite the feminine resistance is the "memristor". it is a programmable resistance. resistance, or the amount of energy it dissipates as it flows through it remains until it's programmed to be a different way. this is really good, analogus of control. resistors are kind of like funnels. they only allow so much current to flow through. from what I've heard of the technology, it requires a special built structure to allow it to be programmed (similar to a semiconductor), and it apparently is nearly to impossible to create large resistors. these are very tiny ones (like microns wide) and can only allow a very small amount of current to flow through them. they're mostly used for "fine tuning" of a resonating circuit. they can also be used to store extremely large amounts of data as well. when the resistance is programmed the structure itself physically changes. the immortal feminine[^1].

I consider it the immortal feminine, because it takes some time to become conscious of this aspect. you don't want everything to be a short circuit (or nearly 0 resistance) because the vibrations would all be very high. you want to be able to control the speed of your vibration consciously, and to resist some things more than others. consider for exahple that every time you have a strong impulse (high voltage), you program these resistors. just imagine the common case of sex or trauma. these high voltages come as a result of interaction with an external sources of potential, therefore if every single of of these events were to program the resistors without any other thing, this would be bad. this is how children learn at first, but later on it becomes necessary to gain conscious control of this and redirect these signals through your own (consciously created) circuits of perception, instead of just letting all signals through to program at will. progwam your environment or be programmed by it.

---

personally, I don't consider myself to have the immortal masculine very well understood. I can sort of get the idea of forming a structure where the energy that flows through it flows through creating the magnetism vibrating at the frequency and shape that I want, but this is largely not very well understood by me. I know some men are quite good at this. I am certain however that I am quite good at the immortal female. I can easily program and reprogram my resistance so rapidly, that this allows me to nearly shapeshift in concept. I think that this is precisely the necessary thing to travese time at will. clearly the other is space.

[1]: the analogue of this may be considered, if the person is considered to be a vibrational being, that these programmable resistors are programmed by high voltage events, so things like solar outbursts, sex, drugs, trauma, laughter, etc. -- any case of strong *emotion*. peter emphasises the utilisation of emotion to convey these ideas.


### saturn the jester (and using humour as a method to bypass power structures)

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/3p65eldbGiQ?t=1687)

humour is the unique ability to take something taboo or resistant in nature and to reprogram that resistance so that it appears lighter and funnier, thereby adjussting the *emotion* associated with it. I explain that one naviages time with their emotion. this is a *very* saturian concept.0

### 12th night & twins

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/3p65eldbGiQ?t=2855)

I don't know the play but peter is saying that the comedies are representing the whole initiatory path in the form of jest. he says that the mortal being is born (on christmas), and but it isn't until the end of 12th day, is the epiphany that the spiritual being is born.

since weeks are 7 days, the 12 seems te tell me that this has something to do with some sort of procession of the soul through different days or "labours" before enlightenment.

above the grave of shakespeare, are the gemini (twins). there are three symbols associted with them. the spade (adam & eve expelled from the garden cursed to toil the earth -- so, labour or effort), the hourglass (time, cycles, saturn)

the way this relates to twins is that in my system, I outline 7 layers. the centre (4th, heart) being source and contains half of each. the bottom 3.5 are mortal/physical (earth) layers and the top 3.5 are immortal/non-physical (air) layers. it's interesting that there is always a constant conflict going on (even thoughh they're so intertwined) between time and space. these are seen as the difference between saturn (time) and jupiter (space). the hourglass (being a symbol of cycles/repetition) and the spade (as labour or effort) also fall into the same perspective. when you lift weights, do you do reps or heavy lifting?

it's interesting that saturn (unfortuniately called poseidon) was prince of the earth, and jupiter over the air. so saturn (vulcan, -5), is given power over the earth (7), and jupiter (thoth, -7) who is very physical is given power over the air (5). air is always associated with emotions and earth with physical knowledge like science and stuff. so each wire given rulership over their opposite domain. they were both setup for failure from the beginning.

it's also worth mentioning that I gave the example of division in @[noseblog](2021-04-07 21:14) which also mirrors exactly these twins as well. I said that one can think of the first division of the source signal was male and female. from there it divides again into the 4 parts here. in my system, there are 7 rays, which closely align with two sets. the first emanation is 1/2/4/7. this would be the archetype of thoth/zeus which is more phyiscally oriented. the second emination contains the parts 3/4/5/6. this would be the archetype of the emination of vulcan/saturn. you can simplify it (as I have done) by saying that 2/4/6 are transitions or wildcards. they can be a part of either side and can contain both. the two primary types being: 1/7 & 3/5 (both add to 8, btw)

you will notice that I have listed the 4th ray twice, and that's because it's the centrepoint containing both physical and non-physical. the other layers 2 and 6 also contain both physical (you *feel* the relation between physical and non-physical things) and non-physical (your imagination does not take physical form, but it can). the goal here is to add up to 4 so that further divisions are possible. I think that this is designed so that everyone is incomplete (I'm not sure. I can't figure out whether to count 2 and 6 as two each or two halves. this was never clear to me). depending on how you add them, you can get different numbers.

it's also worth noticing that the twins and saturn/satan are both mentioned in the book or revelation in nearly the same part as the "two witnesses" and the serpent of old with 7 heads and 10 crowns. I see this perhaps a bit differently than most. I consider myself to be two beings (at least!) sharing the same body. I do not believe the person is restricted to only one personality containing the same body. a person having multiple persality disorder can exhibit peculiar behaviour between personalities, changing allergies, eyesigsht, body structure, etc. normally however, these people are not usually conscious of the other personality. I've also heard of a similar thing with people who have had their corpus calosum damaged, fully separating the two hemispheres of the brain from eachother. I definitely have my entire right hemispehere turned off. I know it exists and is working because I *feel* it all the time. it also comes out in dream state quite often.

when I had the brain haemorrhage, I clearly identified jesus entering my body. as time went on, I did not discover that this was a massive 2 metre enlighened being but instead showed up always to me in the form of a little girl that I identified as +1, not a -7 which I would say that jesus was. the sirians talk about the 1 being able to act like the 7 (and vice versa). I also know that a conceptual person (5) has incredible logic and capablity to perceive structure patterns over large periods of time (trends). I would say that 3/5 work very well together. in my case, I percive myself as a 3/5, and a 1/7 entered my body and we became really good friends, worked well together and learned a lot from eachother.

clearly, the twins are the divided halves and the point is to get them to come together so that all 7 layers become functional. I have postulated that there may be an intermediary phase before this happens. this is the fully "connected" version of yourself -- the one that would appear to the custodians as "uncontrolable". I postulate that the intermediary stage is one where we're all *kinda* connected.. only 5 of the layers will be available to us. I talk about this further in @[noseblog](2021-04-08 20:04)

I would also say that 1/7 work well together. there are some traps which I will outline here as well.

### gemini twins

I like this story that peter is relating about the gemini twins. one of the twins is immortal and the other is immortal. the twins loved eachother very much and were good friends. however, the mortal one died from a mistake (this reminds me of the "fall"), and so the immortal one went to zeus brokenhearted and said that he wanted to give up his own immortality so thst his brother could come back to life. zeus responds by saying, "why don't I just give both of you the gift of being immortal mortals" -- and so his brother was saved.

this is kinda like the alpha is the mortal, he dies then the immortal twin petitions the mortal twin's ressurection with his own mortality and they both become immortal, the omega.

similar he relates to the dual title of "son of Man" and "son of God". I've always wondered about this, and I suppose it may be referring to a genetic thing where some part of him is born from immortal blood of the "gods" and the other part of him is born of human blood. I think the human bloodline eventually turned out to be better than the royal god blood...

anyway, the dual title reminds me of my father who, when he named me, named me "kenneth" because he would always have struggle between being "fair in the sight of God, and being fair in the sight of Man". I always took that to heart, taking the obvious infrence there to alert me to not putting too much effort into being fair in the sight of men, but to keep myself concerned spiritual fairness instead.

I've always seen myself as dual in aspects. I believe that EVERYONE is bipolar actually, and has not only two sides to them but two gender roles to both sides too, which perfectly matches the two twins, immortal and mortal, each of which are both male and female. I believe this is largely neglected, and people (mostly men) underrate the importance of their opposite side.

### john anthony's work

I've been watching your videos from start to finish here and I think I'm ready to comment now. while I think that there are a lot of de vere references, it seems to me like this period of time seems to mark a sort of temporal resonance. just go with what I'm about to say here, though it may sound a bit crazy, I'm going to try and present it as best as possible.

like I said, I believe the royalty debacle is a sort of temporal forshadowing in the form of comedy and tragedy (he's not king and the 18th earl isn't his son either). let's begin with this verse here with the burnt offering with a dot below it. clearly, the verse is talking about the zodiac. this verse in job clearly is talking about the zodiac, because it says to bring 7 castrated bulls, and 7 rams, and then to make a burnt offering. following the biblical narrative, noah would be the bringer of the taurus/ox era, moses the mars/aries era, and jesus the fish.

I believe the play hamlet is talking about the next era of the zodiac as well (though I have not read it yet). I believe the writers of shakespeare had tapped into a form of temporal perception (I have a lot to say about this, but it involves increasing the amount of DMT your brain produces, likely accomplished with the MAOI technique, which non-ironically is also a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, allowing DMT to pass the blood brain barrier -- like harmaline, one of the ingredients for ayahuasca). point is, they clearly are are able to have a shared temporal perception. this can belikened to 5D... I can explain more if you want to, but it allows for things to be perceived conceptually. you can literally behold things, perceiving them all around and in different moments of time -- which is just how something feels slightly different in the future or past. I'll come back to this.

noah, had 3 sons, shem, ham, and japheth. shem is the semites (phonecians, hebrews, later isrealites), ham is the black guys, and japheth is the white guys. it's a very egyptian perspective on the matter. considering that the torah was written by moses who grew up in egyptian palace, it's not surprising. also, the egyptian flag contains these three colours as well: red (shem), black (ham), and white (japheth). in the story of hamet, the polonius guy being called japheth is the white guy. I have to look it up, but I think this polonius guy is one of the pen names for gaius calpurnius piso, which may have some refrence there (which is why it feels to me like these events are symbolic, which when people focus their attention on these temporal concepts, perceived as symgbols, it shapes the trajectory through time, making time resonances).

there are a lot of references to saturn that I'm noticing, and the other place where there is a dot is eclipses and times. "times" is a really weird because it uses the normal "s". eclipses uses both the normal "s" and the functional "s" -- eclpfes. so you know these, besides just the dot are important.

in a prior video you refrenced the 5 autumns and a titan. you made the connection between rich and rhea (venus). what I took away from that video is that devere perceives himself as adonis (consort to venus), but he had to share her with mars (aries). going through the mythology, things get muddy, but venus was the consort of vulcan. vulcan was born from hera (tiamat?), while athena/venus was born from zeus. I think saturn was the original "el" the primary sun god. in egypt, he's osiris opposite to ra who I think is more similar to jupiter called in that time as "ba-el". adonis and saturn seem to be the same guy (archetypically speaking).

to me it looks like there are 2 sets of archetypes here. I'll call them saturn/vulcan/enki/adonis and jupiter/ra/thoth/enlil. their female counterparts are let's say hera and venus. venus was born of zeus yet is the consort to vulcan. there are a lot of weird crossovers and a lot of blurry lines between the gods and goddesses, but they fall into variations (or mixes with humans) of these two archetyes of time and space. I believe hera is feminine time, giving birth to vulcan. venus/aphrodite represents the physical, being born of zeus. look carefully and you see there are two sets of twins here. two male and two female. as the gemini story goes, one is mortal and the other is immortal. one is god and one is human. son of god and son of man.

it's woth noting that en-ki/saturn/serpent symbol is associated with earth and also time, while the jupiter/eagle symbol with air or physical/space/matter. so earth/time vs air/matter. I think each ruling over their opposite domains is intentional.

it's also worth noting (cause I haven't read it), that it may be "the two gentlemen of uranus" veronus as a funny v/u letter swap to encode unanus' sons (saturn and jupiter). I also see these two (space and time) potentially being the separated twins (the gemini), who's embodiment of the alpha and omega during the traversal of space and time -- each taking turns being good a part of the duality (as perceived good/bad in the corresponding zodical era).

as an example, in the sonnet 116/119, "time" is capitalised. I read that as saturn. there are other places where I would read the word time as saturn as well. considering the context of sonnet 116, it seems to clearly describe the saturnian picture. I believe this is a masonic refrence to "father time" and the broken corinthian column. the corinthian column is the maiden and its broken state seems to be this message. when I look at sonnet 119, it really gives that impression to me.

---

ok so that's the background to where I'm coming from. it's gonna start to get wierd now. this whole thing shows me the way toward the perfection of mankind. there is a raising up to the next level. "I" (eye/yo) splits into I/J, so L/el (11) moves from 11 an imperfected state, into the perfected 12 state. k(10) now moves to 11. "V" (you) splits into U and V. moving v(20) to 22.

I don't really know how to explain this next part easily so just ask if you have questions... I contend that the zodiac can be considered as the world tree or the tree of life. the serpent is associated with the earth (ki) and the eagle with the air (prana). en-ki (prince of the earth, the original IAM, labeled in the king james folio as dedicated to the prince IAM(ES)). I believe this is the serpent energy (kundalini) that rises up the spine and is a reference to saturn. jesus would be the king (or the other way around, dunno).

it seems that these guys (saturn and jupiter) are very strongly tied together. they are time and space -- the two twins that cannot be separated. even in modern measurements, we define distance with a measurement of time, and the measurement of time is done with matter (cesium-137 atom). or, from a metaphsical standpoint, you get the serpent (earth) energy by breathing air, and love/sex (earth) energy can also produce massive amounts of prana (air) energy and can cause tragedy. this is likely what vere was talking about in sonnet 116/119.

so anyway, what I contend is that time is conceptual. your memories are your brain's ability to tune into that moment in time. *all* memories and experiences exist in a common place and you can tune into your own memories easier than others, but you can tune into any experience in any moment of time. the further away in "time" the signal is, the less physical it is, which is why our brain translates them symbolically.

I believe that what vere was kind of realising is that he is kind of like a living symbol of man's trajectory through time. I believe that our planet has passed through three of the quadrants of the zodiac, with one still remaining. we know that at some time venus was "born" and in all of the symbolism she holds power over the lion or is depicted as a fearsome cat. the "flood myth" with gilgamesh, he and enkidu defeat the heavanly bull. it seems that this zodiac cross has to do with these four points: man, eagle, ox, lion.

there is promise that the "lion of judah" will happen. the problem is the lion is exactly opposite the man (sounds like the sphinx). the other strange thing is that there is so much effort to encode two symbols.. the gemini and the tau-rose (taurus) symbols into the works.

let's just assume that the "burnt offering" has to do with the sun (the literal one in our solar system) and this has to do with the baptism of fire (matt 3:11-12, matt 13:10, II sam 23 3-7), that saturn is satan, (or the 7-headed dragon with 10 horns in rev 12), which makes him the belial guy mentioned there in II sam 23 in connection to the burnt offering, thorns, and the speare.

> But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.

what I'm seeing in the work here is that "de vere" considers himself to be a symbol of the perfected man -- the man that will result after the completion of the 4th tau. like I said, we've gone through 3 of the T's in the cross there, so it's time to ge through the 4th T. the fourth T I believe starts in leo and ends in gemini, upon which we will arrive back to tau-ros.

jesus says (mat 6:22) that the light of the body is the I, therefore when thine II's become single, the whole body will be full of the light (FIAT LVX).

in the story of noah the major event that transitioned them from one world age to another, lasted 4T days and 4T nights. jesus fasted for 4T days, moses spent 4T years in the wilderness... etc. it's a code :)

tl;dr: the authors of shakespeare are manipulating time with symbols and concepts presented in the works of shakespeare as a method to alter the trajectory of time through more of the symbols in the comedies and tragedies. some of these events may be literal, I grant you that but I think it more likely that the "vere" symbol may have more to do with the man (vir) being perfected in preparation for the full kundalini rising initiation (the fourth T).

====

two corrections:

first, I'm not sure why it reminded me of gaius calpurnius piso. there's a guy that suggests (somewhat convincingly) that piso is plutarch. for some reason I got that mixed up with polonius.... oh well.

most importantly,  I immediately assumed that the feminine form of saturn would be he hera because vulcan came from her. however, upon further thought, I realise that hera is very much like zeus with shapeshifting and other physical-like characteristics. she's not very conceptual. what I'm looking for is a goddess that's very symbolic/conceptual in nature. I tried hard to think of one and I can't figure any out off of the top of my head, though it's quite possible that what I'm looking for is demeter/persephone. I find that interesting because every time you said penelope (rich), my brain interpreted it as persephone (of the underworld). it's quite possible that this feminine characteristic is the creative desire of the fourth T. I don't know.

=====

ah yes, I found your channel through a comment you left on alan's last video :) I'll check out waugh though. you've mentioned them a few times. I still have duite a few videos of yours to watch too. #12 or 13 (I can't remember) started me thinking of the goddess of the underworld references I was thinking with penelope and the possible ties to the in-diane king/heir/prince (diane is a goddess of the underworld)

anyway, I didn't mean only a metaphorical king. I meant that I find it likely those events did happen, *and* they are a sort of time resonance to the passage into the next era (coming soon, I think).

the reason why I say this is because in conceptual perception (5d), you tune into things, and it doesn't matter what time frame it is. if you're practising kundalini, then you'll be starting to get 4d vision where you can conjure and manipulate mental objects in 3d space.  things will look a lot different too. as you continue to purify your alchemical gold, you'll pass beyond that and again start to see things differently.this is what I'm talking about when I say conceptual (5d) perception. beyond that further is temporal, allowing you to tune into anyone and anything in any moment of time (there are infinite possibilities).

when you think of tuning into something you can only tune into somethting that you resonate with. you can tune into anything -- the good, the bad, and the ugly, so you have to know how to navigate that space and learn to feel good about anything. everything is part of life and people living and dieing is a part of that. if you see tragedy and it really bothers you, you will feel strong negagive emotion and that's not good, so you have to learn to see things from a more and more "divine" perspective. what's happening is, you're tuning into your immortal twin and from that perspective everyone and everything is conceptual. you perceive "time" instead as a transformation of energy. everyone, and I mean quite literally, everyone has this eternal twin. from that perspective (knowing that you're really immortal) all tragedy appears more like comedy (you need to experience it to understand what I mean).

so the tuning process is finding what I resonate with (not aginst) any person place or thing, and from that perspective it begins to give you a strong feeling of knowing of what that is like. you're sharing that mental space with anything. you behold it for what it is, not for what it appears to be. the 3d theatre that is happening all around is just what things appear to be. they are NOT what they really are. you are much more than this physical body and from that perspective you appear to be a body performing in a play. again, you have to experience it to understand.

so with no limits to what you can tune into, you may wonder how you can perceive things of the future. well, as you gut further away from your present moment, the way things are perceived becomes more and more abstract and symbolic. your brain doesn't have a way to translate the signal into valid 3d constructs like cars, streets, clothes and things. your brain picks the closest match to the signal, much like what happens in a dream or an altered state of consciousness.

---

so, for me, I think this explains why de vere talks in such blasphemy ways (I am that I am), because from that perspective, he is. if I tune into you I enter your body and see things from your perspective, as if I were you. because our perceptions are so different, it's difficult to tune into things in the present moment because I have to become resonant with how they are *right now*. it's much easier to tune into a more perfected version of someone else. it's even easier to tune into a perfected version of myself. when you get this capability, you will grow and expand very wise very rapidly, because anything you want to know you can tune into it and then start working the symbols, feelings or concepts you receive into present knowledge. I don't like to tune into people in their present moment, because I have to vibrate like they do. I prefer the perfected version of them (their immortal twin), or into general concepts and ideas that interest me (like shakespeare). it begins a flood of new things that I begin to make sense, making a bigger and bigger conceptual picture of the thing. for example, finding your videos completely opened a new way to perceive de vere for me. as you're explaining the things, I can feel some of the tragedy and comedy and stuff.

you have to have some sort of exposure or experience with subjects like that to be able to write about them. this form of perception will rapidly accelerate your life because your life will begin to reflect the things you tune into, and I think that's why I found your's and alan's channels.

ok man, I have so much more I want to say. please ask me anything and I'll do my best to answer. I don't belong to any of these secret organisations and hold no secrets (because I know that from that perspective, nothing can be secret anyway). the reason why no one is talking about this stuff is because the secret organisations know about it and want to keep it secret. I discovered it on my own and began to recognise the symbols these societies have. I don't have it all figured out by any means, but I don't think the secrets are expanding knowledge. they say it's to protect the purity of the information, but personally I'm a man of chaos tragedy and humour (you gatta laugh at the fails). I have learned everything from mistakes, and I think it would be good if people made more of them. I think the more fails that there are with people tuning into whatever interests them, naturally you will (as I have) gravitate toward the stuff that feels good. there's no sense in, and I have no intention of ever keeping any of it a secret.

ok man cheers :)

====

yep I resonate with the FIAT LVX one as well.

I'm not convinced that he died on that day at all. when it comes to a birth, death or resurrection around the time of the solstice, this is always solar symbolism. always.

to follow that thread a bit, jesus' birth is celebrated 3 days after the winter solstice. this is seemingly backwards because the winter solstice is when the sun dies, not is born. the winter is the time of the least light. on the solstice, the sun appears to stop moving (eg it rises in the same spot) for a few days before returning to its normal trsversal across the sky. looking at a sine wave, it's pretty obvious why that is on the solstice (which corresponds with the peaks). then after being stuck for a few days, when it begins to move, this is it's rebirth or resurrection.

we know the very well accepted idea that christ was crucified (on a cross), then after 3 days he resurrects. again this is solar symbolism, but the weird thing is that this is celebrated for his birth. easter (I had to look it up) is celebrated a week after the first full moon past the equinnox -- meaning, the first waning quarter moon after equinox. I don't really understand why that is, but it must have to do with agriculture. google says that the below ground plants should be planted during the waning moon. the waning moon right after equinox would also be the best time to plant, "flowering bulbs, biennial and perennial flowers, and vegetables that bear crops below ground" -- I guess that makes sense for someone being throw into the ground more than someoen resurrected. so agan, the symbolism is backwards.

I hadn't thought about it, but when I was taking a shower just now I decided I want to look at the solar symbolism for his "death". first, let's put this into context. correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think de vere identified himself with saturn amongst other things. you know this more than me here. I'm jsut saying that because saturn was once regarded as a solar deity, but then you have the image of father time (saturn), hse sickle, a weeping maiden, and the broken corinthian column. I probably have some of those details wrong, but this appears to be about "let there be light" (FIAT LVX) and solar symbolism.

as I established above, the symbolism is backwards, so let's swap them. instead of being born 3 days after the solstice, we shall consider that, like the sun he died on the solstice, and then was reborn on 3 days after the winter solstice. this is when there is the least amount of light.

de vere "died" -- so that really means born or reborn 2-3 days after the summer solstice (a midsummer night's dream). because this is the summer solstice, this is when there is the most light of the year.

I dunno exactly what it means. please leeme know if you have any other symbols that fit into it (or videos to send me toward). I'll keep thinking on it myself. this is really all I wanted to tell you today. hope it sparked some thought :)

### sonnet 116 & 55

these seem to be talking about the end of the world, both containing the words, "edge of doom". 116 speaks of time in relation to love,

"Lou's not Times foole though rosie lips and cheeks"
"Loue alters not with his(Time's) brief houres and weekes"
"but bears it out euen to the edge of doome"

so love, though rosie lips and cheeks doesn't alter with time it continues on till the very bitter end (edge of doome).

55 takes a different look at it.

"you will shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time" (I think time here is a refrence to saturn and physical/sluttish love)

it goes on for a bit about mars (aries), war, death, but it sounds like you (the reader/humans?) will continue on to wear the world out until to the ending doome followed by a very LOAesque phrase:

"so, till the judgement that your selfe arise"
"you live in this [judgment] and dwell in lovers eyes"

... but remember that love alters not with time's hours and weeks (it's eternal/immortal). it bears it out even till the edge of doome. bears what out? the wars, death, and of mars (aries) and his sword -- till judgement of yourself arise

---

so, all of this should be put in the context of job 41 (the leviathan). it's describing something pretty scary sounding (scales, breathes fire, strong, etc.), but then the final verses are very telling:

33 upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
34 he beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.

so, he's unlike anyone else on the earth (set apart), he's fearless, and is king of all children of pride. this sounds very de vere :) however, it's describing a sea dragon. the sea dragon beholds all high things, not sure if high means lofty or high means perspective (like an eagle).

anyway, the sumerians have the earth (ki) coming from an a very chatic sea dragon (tiamat). she may not be a dragon herself, but she gives birth to dragons and snakes. being a sea dragon, she also qualifies for the underworld (like persephone).


### sonnet 121


> ’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,

starts off by presenting the idea that it's better to be the "bad-guy" than the bad-guy that appears to be the good-guy.

> When not to be receives reproach of being,

and when you're not the bad-guy, you receive the reproach of being a bad-guy.

> And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed

presenting now the bad-guys' (which are pretending to be the good-guys)' loss of pleasure...

> Not by our feeling, but by others’ seeing:

they didn't lose the pleasure by losing their own capacity to feel (5d), but instead lose their pleasure when others see (FIAT LVX)

> For why should others’ false adulterate eyes

not sure. something about not being able to hide secrets

> Give salutation to my sportive blood?

not sure

> Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,

"as I walk through time, devoid of lies". I can't really tell exactly what this is saying, but it feels to me like it's poetically describing a world where nothing is hidden and nothing unseen (eg. anyone can see anything - 5d)

> Which in their wills count bad what I think good?

nosebook thinks what I am doing is bad, yet I think it's good :)

> No, I am that I am, and they that level

... "opening my eyes"

> At my abuses reckon up their own:
> I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;

I'm just a straightforward guy :)

> By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;

they can't allow my "deeds" to be broadcasted though.

> Unless this general evil they maintain,
> All men are bad and in their badness reign.

they have to maintain their general evel and ensure that all men continue to believe that they are bad, evil, original sin, etc. all that nonsense.

you are not evil. you are divinity! you are source! you are pure positive energy. it's only these guys that that have tried to convince you otherwise. lol...

now, having written the below stuff, I want to return to this sonnet, because I see it differently now. when I had my experience in the hospital, I recognised and made an agreement with a very luminous being I identified as jesus. there's no doubt in my mind now that this was TTT/jupiter. the weird thing is that as I got to know this personality embedded into my left-side, I discovered that it was a young girl, someone I would positively identify as venus -- which means lucifer -- the queen of heaven.

that makes my left-side (right brain) the jupiter/tesla/aquarian side -- and, the right-side (left brain) then saturnian side. so, imagine for a moment that sonnet being written by me, as I interpretted it above. I clearly show the saturnian side and also the jupiterian side at the same time. I've basically ripped off all of the jupiter stuff I liked and used it for my advantage.

I posess both qualities -- which is a weird thing because I just noticed jesus says, "when thy eye (I) becometh single" -- which means they need agreement. they need to be on the same frequency and then things will work well. in my present situation I don't have that luxury, so what I do is I just define myself in an infinite number of ways and it's unstoppable.

I believe that shakespeare was writing from a future perspective of having attained the 4T (see below), which is why it's encoded with the FIAT LVX symbolism. in short, "let there be light" must have been the beginning of a very high state of consciousness on the earth. they were not singular. they were the el-ohim (el = saturn = lord shiva). and in that state, all things were recreated from whatever the previous catacysm is (plato and lots of archeological evidence inform us that there have been many). therefore I postulate that those surviving the cataclysm found theirself in a godlike state where thoughts became reality, and the earth was (re)created.

### sonnet 123

thia sonnet appears to be written from the perspective of the "victim". which seems exactly opposite of the above one which appears to be written from the perspective of "TTT" (IAM that IAM). the weird part is he starts off by saying it's better to be vile than to be vile that appears good. however, there isn't much of a "vile" sound to the perspective of the orator of the sonnet. however, this sonnet, it does appear that there is a second perspective coming in here.

what I mean is that TTT is considered to be different than Time.

"with the sacred key, I open the door to understanding"

I see two perspectives in these. one is TTT (alpha and omega) -- which is weird bevause I thought that alpha and omega was saturn, but from the sound of this sonnet, it appears that TTT (as described in S121) is considered different to "Time". going to the original thing TTT is really YHVH, the name that was given to moses by the burning bush.

ok so there are clearly two perspectives here. there is TTT and there is Time. I must consider that Time is referring to saturn, aka "father time" because it keeps referring to him with his sickle (sythe). saturn was agricultural god and needs time to grow -- and I tuess a shepherd is really needing more the space than the time.. well, so does the shepherd too. they both need time and space, you cannot grow crops instantly, an3 a herd size is limited by space.

anyway, back to the TTT vs. Time thing. for this, the author of shakespeare is clearly writing, "I am that I am" and so therefore identifying with TTT. furthermore, on shakespeare's memorial:

```
IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MÆRET, OLYMPVS HABET

The first line translates as "A Pylian in judgement, a Socrates in genius, a Maro in art," comparing Shakespeare to Nestor the wise King of Pylos, to the Greek philosopher Socrates, and to the Roman poet Virgil (whose last name, or cognomen was Maro). The second reads "The earth buries him, the people mourn him, Olympus possesses him," referring to Mount Olympus, the home of the Greek gods.

- wikipedia (2021-05-02)
```

clearly "olymus habet" identifies the writer of shakespeare as jupiter. from now on, I'm going to YHVH = TTT = jupiter = thoth.

this sonnet illuminates quite a lot writing from the perspective of jupiter.

> No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:

this can be seen two ways. I saw it differently the first time. this is how I saw it:
the unchaging YHVH is saying that he does change now, however saturn should not boast about it.

however, I would contend that it is saying, "saturn, don't boast saying, 'I do change'" which changes the meaning to be more like ... oh, ok so you change; good for you. don't boast about it (cause I still don't want to).

> Thy pyramids built up with newer might
> To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
> They are but dressings of a former sight.

this is claiming that saturn (ptah? osiris? not sure what he means here) built the pyramids, and that in this new time of FIAT LVX he will rebuild them with "newer might" ... but they're still nothing special.

> Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
> What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
> And rather make them born to our desire
> Than think that we before have heard them told.
> Thy registers and thee I both defy,

jupiter still hates saturn

> Not wondering at the present nor the past,
> For thy records and what we see doth lie,

everything is an illusion (jupiter's illusion, I may add)

> Made more or less by thy continual haste.

jupiter doesn't like that saturn goes fast.

> This I do vow, and this shall ever be,
> I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.

not sure what jupiter is admiting to saturn here. I'm not sure what "being true" means. sounds to me like "keeping it real", lol. considering the first ine of the sunnet, this sounds to me like, even if he knows he'll always be defeated by saturn's scythe, he's going to remain true (to jupiter's nature?) and this will always be that way. sounds like an agreement to me :)

### an alternate interpreation of the 4th tau

having head the sonnets above now, I have to conclude that TTT = jupiter and the 4th T is saturn. I the picture thst is coming to me head is the picture of father time, the weeping virgin and the broken corinthian column. weeping virgin I think = virgo. judging by all of the amazing rock art in india depicting elephants (libra) and so many other great things, this must have been the reign of saturn. however, I think what happened may have something to do with venus.

the way I see is that the atlantian culture setup by saturn back during his reign was really great and stuff, but the atlantians didn't follow the rules of creation, and corrupted theirselves. essentially the sons of saturn ran his empire into the ground. then, out of the forhead of jupiter comes athena/venus which then establishes the reign of jupiter. she must have caused lots and lots of destruction. this is why the innana/sekhmet goddess is shown standing on top op a lion.

what happened is similar to what is happening now. instaed of going from virgo to leo, inanna interviened and changed the course. I believe this is why "the man" is aquarius and it was his daughter that gave him this power. it totally destroyed the (now very corrupt) saturnian/atlantian empire. this was the younger dryas catastrophe.

jupiter has been reigning ever since. 12kya in the wake of such destruction, the corrupt(? -- I'm sure it was a mix) atlantians continued to cause problems and be wiped out by the now dominant athenians (zeus). we went back up to the top and I beilive there was another intervening force which is recorded as "mithras". I find it quite possible that mithras may very well be the same guy as ramtha, which is a saturnian figure self-sabotaging. I say self sabotage because if we were to continue on, we'd go over to libra again and be once more on saturn/enki's side of the zodiac. instead we went down to taurus to remain on jupiter's side of the zodiac.

that's the latest narrative and the one I'm going to work from now. ok, on to the 4th T.

TTT = IAM that IAM

so, if we add the 4T, it becomes:

IAM that IAM that

this, kind of symbolises the "source" perspective of things. let's look at the progression:

> T: IAM

this is the first phase. the human becomes conscious and figures out that she is more than just a robot. she has "free-will" to choose whatever she wants to.

> TT: IAM that

now, the human after havving become conscious and capable of directing her will, now she is beginning to be programmed. she is told what she is, and she defines herself externally, saying "IAM this or that. these things are me"

> TTT: IAM that IAM

I consider this to be the third phase, when the human begins to define herself both with external things but also with self definition. I like this phase because it is a perfect balance between "IAM that" and "that IAM". I consider this to be the battle of being defined externally vs internally. here's why:

when I say "IAM that", phrases of these kind include:

- I am stupid
- I am smart
- I am a nobody
- I am not good at anything

these are all phrases that we all do to define ourself in the sense of the impression we want to give. it's external and internal marketing. we're tryint to tell the ourself or the other person the definition we thing they/I want to hear. it's almost always not true. it's just a an appeal to somone's perception to get them to see you in a certain way.

the phrase, "that IAM", for me is a bit more of what I do. it's very childlike but a child is not conscious of what they are doing. I go arounsd (like a child) and I identify things that I like in other people and I just copy them. *that* I (now) am. see what I mean? it's like copying some attribute from someone. we all do it, and sometimes we do it consciously. when doing this unconsciously, it's kind of like "creating by default". if you watch me, I'm a a bit of a chameleon in the sense that I just adopt/adapt the identity of those around me (shamelessly, I may add). I am a huge collection of "that IAM"s; a composite personality, artificially constructed, tuned and optimised to my specifications.

having a fully artificial definition of myself, I can be anything I want to be -- and I literally mean *anything*. which brings me to the 4T definition.

> TTTT: IAM that IAM that

EDIT: got a bit mixed up here. I originally said that I perceived this phase as being source like, then went on to describe what I would like to refer to as the 5T (see below).

the idea here is that in this phase the human begins to see herself in all things. source exists in all things, and you begin to recognise that everything is made in your image -- or, you may say, everything reflects your identity/definition of yourself. all things become a reflection of the human and in addition to perceiving yourself in everything (which is a really good thing if you like yourself).

as I'm writing this, I just realised that this is what the end of sonnet 121, "All men are bad and in their badness reign." -- reason is, because jupiter does not want to change, so therefore in this 4T setup that we're going toward, "IAM that IAM that" means that jupiter will now try and make everyone a reflection of him -- eg. "all men are bad (like me) and in their badness reign (like me)".

this isn't the end of the story though. I contend that we're going to keep this going for quite some time. jupiter says he will never change (sounds strangely like mr. motor ironically) and will remain the same no matter what. well guess what 5T is...


> TTTTT: IAM that IAM that IAM

this one is kind of a list. it's really the ultimate ego trip in a lot of ways because with the help of LOA, everything is a reflection of how you feel and what you believe about myself (4T). however, now with the addition of the final IAM, what is happening is again this another balance happening. this can be read four ways now:

- IAM that. IAM that. IAM. (external definition, external definition, who I really am)
- IAM that. IAM. that IAM. (self definition, who I really am, external definition)
- IAM. that IAM. that IAM. (who I really am, self definition, self definition)

read them how you want to, but the one that excites me the most is the last one. it's kind of like the perfected side of the TTT: "IAM. that IAM." here'a why, now the list of self definitions can become an extra layer removed. I am a list now of definitions.

this is really great because I can go around all over the place and attract from other people tiny bits of own definition of myself. when I like my self definition, this is great. I'm literally going around and noticing all of the things that I love about myself in other people.

on top of all of that, the things that I attract from people are also improvements I want to make on my personality, too. so the definition of me is constantly improving.

the fifth tau.

### the tau of perception

as I was writing the above, I realised that the tau count is similar to what I call perception. when I think of 5d, I'm thinkint of 3T, because I'm perceiving the thing from all angles. to understand, say 3d = 1T. 4d = 2T because one can now extend their imagination out into the environment and say, "IAM that" and it appears. when you say IAM, it is a feeling, and so when you feel that, the feeling (that you feel) extends itself out into 3d space and becomes a reality. next 5d = 3T where you can behold the feeling definitition of yourself or an object, and perceive it from all angles.

6d = 4T pretty obviously because now you're no longer limited to a single body. you can have multiple identities of yourself (IAM that, and IAM that, too). you can keep this going for as much as you want.

so while jupiter may vow to never change, he doesn't have to. in 5T, that identity can remain fixed for eternity (never ever changing), but if he wants the latest vision upgrade, he'll need to redefine himself. I suppose he could make another very similar to jupiter version of himself, but then he'd have to find a way to keep them from fighting and competing with eachother. which one is superior? will jupiter make an inferior version of himself to punish endlessly for his badness?

I dunno, but probably... lol. he'll likely never give it up, I'm sure. I'm sure he has an agreement with himself he has to keep (even though he never keeps an agreement not in his self-interest, lol). I think it's great and I think it's actually a very good thing to exploit. imagine that each future 2T expansion, we make another world (galaxy, star, planet, etc) and give him rulership over that domain (or something easy to conquest), then he can endlessly make new versions of himself which "ever" won't change -- making jupiter invaluable for the endless contrast and expansion he brings.

### midsummer's night dream

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/tmVlhBgSRPk?t=2220)

in the play, alan is pointing out some things happening here. first is that the mechanicals are stuck using the julian calendar. they're a little behind the times. I find the timing of this interesting because the play poings out that because of the date change, 3.5 days before the new moon is the "death" of devere. he dies in 6/24/1604.

in the latest of alan's videos he keeps carrying on about the pentecost. I lookd it up and this year it's 2021-05-23 for the gregorian calendar. however, the mechanicals are using the julian calendar. they put easter as yesterday (2021-05-02), then strangely enough the "assension" is 2021-06-10 which happens to also be a new moon. this means that 3.5 days before that, devere will die (the 6th/7th). the new moon happens (orthodox assension), then there's the 4 days after the new moon is the midsummer night's dream wedding(?), which is the 14th. then I guess the pentecost is like the 20th or something, followed by a full moon on the 24th.

weird numbers. so here's the thing. the reason why I bring it up is the obvious similarity to the two witnesses in rev 11. devere refers to himself as the "twice 11 brethren". I too enjoy the 11 number and stuff too. well, rev 11:11 says, "then after 3.5 days, the breath of god entered [the two witnesses]". so, kinda weird that the same thing is sort of happening here. you have devere "dieing" 3.5 days before the new moon. then, on the julian calendar (that the mechanicals are using), the breath of god enters back into the two witnesses and they stood back up on the new moon, the day of "asension" (the 10th).

so the way that connects with stuff is I was reminded of the time I was talking in @[noseblog](2021-04-09 07:02), strangely titled, "future pixels":

```
what the reminder there about the two witnesses (twins) tells me is that they may completely disable me, making me appear completely dead. think about it. if my physical experience is now stronger than their ablity to hold it back, the only real solution for them would be drastic. they would have to completely disable *all* of my experience -- aka a deep sleep or a coma. I would imagine it would be like those times when I gain consciousness when they're working on my head. it's all black. I can't feel my body, but I'm alive and it's warm and vibrant in there -- just no sensory information at all. it's roughly how I imagine a baby in the womb would feel.
```

what I'm saying is they could disable my complete experience, and if you've followed my other stuff, I'm talking about the regenative (6th) and pineal (2nd) chakras completely, using them purely for their own purposes (routing people'h experience throgh it like tehy are now). because so many people's perception is being routed through my own, I'm kind of like a walking great pyramid -- call my pyramis, I guess -- which is a bit weird.

anyway, I went in to really put on the speculation goggles because I showed how, even if they changed the encryption key for the other people's perception, I could still figure out a way to perceive again using what I call "conceptual programs". I encourage the read. it's pretty fascinating. anyway, I continue on that while I'm certain that it is possible to find a way to get back into my body again in a connected state, maybe that's *isn't* what I want to do. let me explain.

the 4T is "IAM that. IAM that." so what it is, is what I describe as 6d perception (see above). this is where I have multiple identities which are me. I find it fascinating to have that kind of perception because I can literally be any number(?) of me that I want to be. as long as there is desire for it, it can exist. I know this sounds a bit far out. all of those different versions of me *are* me. I can define any of them any way that I want them to be.

personally, I don't have much of a required set of attributes that I define is being "me" -- like I said, I'm a composite personality that I've cultivated over the years and turned into something that I like. I'm not defined by things and people. I have defined myself (that IAM). so this is a transition to being once again defined externally. I imagine that the girls will do the majority of this definition. I've made essentially a template, and then anything can be changed. literally anything. my appearance and even their own too (however, that's another story for another time).

it'll be possible to move things around in "reality" as if it were a dream -- which may be why it's called "midsummer night's dream" -- lol. sounds like everyone is getting 5d soon as I figure out 5d perception and create a new translation layer.

I also find it humorous how the mechanicals are putting on the worst disaster of a play, too.

---

don't worry that I'm going to be stuck in this sort of detached multiple identities version of myself. it's a good thing I've been giving a lot of thought to the next version up, 5T -- which (see above) allows me another IAM, so I have a self perception. this will bump me up to 7d perception now, which is what I previously have called a few times YHVH perception. originally, I anticipated it going the other way, meaning that I would first "get connected", realise myself conceptually as 5d. then, I would begin to move temporally in 6d. from there, it's easy to see that once you can move around temporally, then it's not much of a stretch to perceive yourself as more than one entity (7d). it appears, the way things are shaping up, that I will do that backwards. I'll go with the multiple identities version of myself, then I'll figure out who "I" am and self define myself once again.

I plan to stick to the #2 & #3 versions of 5T:
1. IAM that. IAM that. IAM. (external definition, external definition, who I really am)
2. IAM that. IAM. that IAM. (self definition, who I really am, external definition)
3. IAM. that IAM. that IAM. (who I really am, self definition, self definition)

having "me" be the last one there, then a number of externally defined versions of me. however, since it will be a dream-state kind of like reality, I'm sure there will be a lot of of the first ones too, and it's quite possible that many of these, will be defined (and controlled) by nosebook. I don't mind. it's all part of my pyramid scheme :)

from all of your perspective, it'll probably just look like I'm getting more and more enhanced perception until it starts to really go off the rails. who knows how bad things will start to get soon. it may look like I die or go into a coma for a while. I'll wake up for sure though. like I said, I am sure I can get back into this body, but why not go for a better version? I'm sure nosebook will have a more complete story of what is happening, but I doubt they'll tell. that's a bit of a cucumber for them. it's going to be fun though :)

antoher aspect to think about is the idea of reutilising my 4/5T technology to create their own version(s) of me or other identities (under their control of course), and then directing them. it's another way to get them to start to figure out what they want, instad of what they don't want -- though, I think it's fine if they make a whole bunch of mechanicals and put on a real disaster of a play. lol. all part of the pyramid scheme. to you guys they'll appear indistinguishable from me or anyone else. the only way to tell the ones claiming to be me apart from the others will be by how they feel and how they behave, talk, their message, etc.

when/if they figure this out, these could be "the mechanicals 2.0"...

disclaimer: this is obviously a whole lot of specualtion goggles. please don't take me too seriously :D


### a play-within-a-play

I propose that this is an artistic description of my own brain, each part of my brain played by a mechanical. I propose that pyramis is me, normal kenny (left brain), and thisby is the version of jupiter I saw enter my body during the haemorrhage (right brain), a little girl with insatiable desire I would describe as venus.

perhaps the wall is my corpus collusum? tom snout (pyramis' father) is a blacksmith, or a tinkerer. perhaps some aspect of tesla?

moonshine is thisby's mother, but instead plays the part of moonshine, as pyramis and thisby are to meet under the shining of the moon (btw, 6/24 is a full moon this year)

### two versions of jupiter

as I was writing the things yesterday, I noticed a distinct difference between two jupiters. the jupiter that I know (my right brain), which is his duaghter, and I would contend that her birth was actually a planned one, and is retold in the myth of vulcan creating for a zeus pandora who will plaugue the inhaibants of the earth with her crafty ways (the shrew?) -- and that venus is symbolicaally both athena (protector of the athenians, lover of wisdom, knowledge -- the perfect attratctor to the hermes, essentially).

the combination of hermes and affrodite is told to be a hermaphodite. so going back to me two sets of twins. you have two dudes, one is inductance and the other is capacitance. these are both male archetypes. I'm not sure which one is the immortal one. more discussion on that later, I'm sure. then, there is the female, pandora or venus, which is resistnce. resistance is in found in all thing. venus/pandora is the archetypical female form. so then, when you put the two together and you get a hermaphodite, which you have the lover of the physical -7 typs (tesla, thoth, zeus, etc.), the perfect opposite to the -7 types. the traditional two dudes and one girl are the typical "triad" cycle of threes found everywhere. however with the addigion of a fourth type now, the memristor, we add the hermaphodite to the group now (the 4th T?).

from a genetics standpoint this is an interesting discussion. imagine for a moment that inductance/capacitance are the y-chromosome and resistance/memristance is the x-chromosome. the "perfect" guy would be two YYX, but no two guys can ever stare the same X... too much competition. so, instead, the male form has to be XY. with men playing either a simple RC circuit or RL semi-circuit setup (it's not more than a single inductor with some stray resistance) in that sense, if you are an inductive (RL) man, in order to have a resonating circuit, men need a capacitor (another man). huh...

now, think about it from a female perspective. I consider that the X can be anything that it wants to be.. this is the "god aspect" to our genetics. what I mean by that is it is by nature resistance. as an example, all inductors have some resistance but it is the change in direction that the current makes as the electrons flow through its geometry which the induction. current doesn't flow through a capacitor, so it has infinite resistance till their breakdown pressure is reached, then it becomes low resistance. so, consider that the X, if it were to essentially shapeshift could easily be an inductor or a capacitor. I'm greatly simplifying the circuits. I imagine that the Y has many inductors and capacitors in it. I'm saying it's more inductor or more capacitor. I'm also saying that the X can rearrange into whatever shape it wants to, being inductor capacitor or a complicated set of programmable resistances. take the gay references for how you want; they weren't intentional.

whatever the case, I wanted to draw a distinction between the two sides of my head. while I'm sure that I am originally made in the image of jupiter, I believe I have figured out how to change and to rearrange my circuits to be whatever I want them to be. like I said, I've completely reprogrammed my personality. on one side you have the saturnian kenny and othe other side you have jupiter, but it's not manstream jupiter, it's his daughter (designed by vulcan?).
