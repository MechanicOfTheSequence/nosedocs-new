### SSS - super secret symbol

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=3530)

the holy of holies
hebrew: devir
has ark (heart) between two pillars (cherubs)

stiletto sidech solo
(residence of) the sovereign master of all things
the three candlesticks - the three degrees of fire

- (where two or three are *gathered together*)
  - 2 points = line
  - 3 points = triangle
  - greek word for tathered together: syna-goge
  - left pillar
    - left hemishere - masculine - logic, location, syncronisation
  - two pillars + one ark = 2 or three gathered together
    - very likely that the two pillars refer to the duality of the human (male/female, light/dark, etc)
      - this makes the ark the heart
    - could also be the synchronisation of the two hemispheres
      - this makes the ark the pineal

- (in my name)
  - IAM (that) IAM - TTT - TH
  - rigwt pillar
    - right hemisphere - feminine - emotion, feeling (state of mind)
  - there's a weird symetry here:
    - "where two or three" is referring to the holy of holies (SSS)
    - "in my name" is referring to IAM (that) IAM
      - "in" which you would think is a location
      - but the location "my name" (SSS) is already stated
      - so it has to be in another state (probably of the mind)

- there I AM
  - self referential to the first part, like saying the two pillars are the two pillars (which have two pillars)
    - the two pillars (SSS, which has two pillars) + the state of mind (TH) (IAM (that) IAM) which has also two pillars (IAM (divine) + AMI (human))
    - I-AM + AM-I | divinity + humanity
      - there are the two pillars of divine nature and human nature (which need to be balanced
      - interesting also to note here the same with the compass + square


### compass + square

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/2YoZuO9NpOA?t=2958)

- compass
  - divinity
    - cycles / eternal / never ending
  - triangle up
    - pyramid
    - fire
    - masculine
  - compass creates a circle
- square
  - humanity
    - earth
  - triangle down
    - water
    - feminine
  - square creates straight lines

- the balance between the two is for feminine to make straight lines, and for masculine to make circles
- there's another weird thing in the genesis symbols:
  - the the square (earth) is a feminine symbol (triangle down), yet God created man (adam) from the earth.
  - the compass (divinity), is the masculine symbol (triangle up), however God created woman (eve) from adam in likeness of Himself (divinity)
- the square is the circle & the circle is the square (squaring the circle)




### TTT = TH = IAM (that) IAM = AM-I-AM

god: there I AM
jesus: there AM I


AM-I-AM
AM (that) I AM

short code: TTT (tripie tau)

----

IAM the Alpha and Omega
IAOM

MAOI
OMAMI
IMAMO

divinity: to be
humanity: !to be


sonnet 121 - uses the name of God
```
noe, I am that I am
  and they that luell at my abuses
rekon up their owne,
I may be straight through they them-
  selves be beuel
by their ranke thoughts,
  my deedes must not be shown
```

noe = noah
luell = symbol 1
beuel = symbol 2

> The square and the compass have a 90° relationship with one another, representing their operations in multiple dimensions.  The masculine compass operates on the "y" axis while the feminine square operates on the "x" axis.  Of further interest is the realization that the square determines the confines and place within space (the x axis [and 'z' axis technically]) while the compass has no choice but to create (through spin) at the space-time of the squares choosing.   The feminine square (matter) has the ability to move within three dimensional space (because the feminine is literally the coalescence of matter in space aka "form"), while the masculine compass is the spirit (or mind/thought), having only the ability to cause but requiring the feminine square to choose the confines and form of the cause.  

> Of further note is the observation of placing a compass' points at the ends of the square.  When one does this you create an optical illusion of a diamond shape.  In reality you have a square operating on the flat, horizontal plane, while the compass is operating in the 3 dimensional, vertical plane.  When looking at the two from a 2d perspective you create a diamond which can collapse on itself and return to 0, thus being representative of expansion of consciousness through dimensionality.


- compass
  - masculine
  - y-axis (vertical)
- square
  - feminine
  - x-axis (horizonal)

huh, I never noticed that feminine square confines space or matter (mater/mother). that's cool.
I didn't understand your second thought: I see the diamond, but I don't understand how you mean by it collapsing on itself. do you mean that it points directly at the perspective so that it appears as a line again, where new spatial dimension is directly perpendicular to the line (coming "at you")?

I'm just going to talk this out, in attempt to figure it out...
while thinking about the above, I remembered another part of the video he talks about "when two or three ..." (I thought it was "two or more", not "or three", so it must be significant) "... are gathered together" (eg. in synagoge, SSS, holy of holies) the 2 or 3 bit stood out to me. inside the holy of holies is 1 ark and two pillars. the one seems implied, so the emphasis is on the 2 or 3 bit. 2 points = a line, and 3 points = a triagle and I think they illustrate what you're trying to say.

- a line in 2d:
  - if you rotate it you get a circle
    - in this sense, a rotating line is behaving like a compass
    - it's showing the plane that it's already in
  - when the line is rotated so it's perpendicular to itself (which you can only find out by drawing the circles, btw)
    - you get a cross, which is sort of like a compass open to 90°

- a line in 3d:
  - if you rotate it, you get:
    - an ellipse (or circle)
    - a single point
      - a return back to its origin or singularity
      - this can show evidence of a new spatial dimension (between the perspective and the apparent point)

- if you rotate a triangle in 2d you just get a plane (that it's alraedy in)
- if you rotate a triangle in 3d:
  - it can appear as a line
    - the space between the perspective and the triangle appearing as a line (perpendicular to the apparent line) is another spatial dimension
  - until it appears like a square (45-45-90)
    - you get another spatial dimension (on the 'z' axis).
    - also, when appearing like a square, it represents a line again (a return back to the beginning)

in other words, a line (2) rotated in 3d, can collapse back to one, or expand the space. however a triangle (3) rotated in 3d can collapse back to a line (2), or show the evidence of 2 new spatial dimensions which can be expanded to. this appears to be infinite.

going back now to tie it together... if you look at the rotation of the line (2 points), it behaves like a compass, drawing a circle. so, in this sense, the line must be masculine. however, if you rotate a triangle (3 points) in 3d, it behaves like a straight-edge (square), and when it "collapses on itself", it reveales the evidence of another spatial dimension perpendicular of the line, the expansion of consciousness. it also has another expansion, when the triangle appears to have a 90° angle to it, then it shows another spatial dimension on the 'z' axis, appearing perpedicular to the other two lines.

off topic: in this sense, if you consider that the expanded form of perception for men is 1 extra dimension, however the feminine expansion of consciousness is 2 extra dimensions. this is a whole another conversaion on what that means, however, if you were to find balanced in your masculinity and femininity (eg. square the circle), you would gain 3 extra dimensions :) that's pretty cool...
